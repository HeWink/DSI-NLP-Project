Recombination Every Day  Abundant Recombination in a Virus during a Single Multi Cellular Host InfectionAs increasing numbers of full length viral sequences become available  recombinant or mosaic viruses are being recognized more frequently   
Recombination events have been demonstrated to be associated with viruses expanding their host range   or increasing their virulence    thus accompanying  or perhaps even being at the origin of  major changes during virus adaptation 
It remains unclear  however  whether recombination events represent a highly frequent and significant phenomenon in the everyday life of these viruses Viruses can exchange genetic material when at least two different viral genomes co infect the same host cell 
Progeny can then become hybrid through different mechanisms  such as reassortment of segments when the parental genomes are fragmented    intra molecular recombination when polymerases switch templates  in RNA viruses     or homologous or non homologous recombination  in both RNA and DNA viruses 
Quantification of viral recombination in multi cellular organisms has been attempted under two distinct experimental approaches  in vitro  in cell cultures     and in vivo  in live hosts    
The in vitro approach  which has so far been applied only to animal viruses  allows the establishment of the  intrinsic  recombination rate in experimentally co infected cells in cell cultures   
However  it does not necessarily reflect the situation in entire  living hosts  where the frequency of co infected cells is poorly known and depends on many factors such as the size of the pathogen population  the relative frequency and distribution of the different variants  and host defense mechanisms preventing secondary infection of cells 
The in vivo experimental approach is closer to biological conditions and may thus be more informative of what actually happens in  the real world However  as discussed below  numerous experimental constraints have so far precluded an actual quantification of the baseline rate of recombination 
First  many experimental designs have used extreme positive selection  where only recombinant genomes were viable  e g    
Other studies did not use complementation techniques but detected recombinants by PCR within infected hosts or tissues    which provides information on their presence but not on their frequency in the viral population 
So far  no quantitative PCR or other quantitative method has been applied to evaluate the number of recombinants appearing in an experimentally infected live host 
Finally  recent methods based on sequence analysis inferred the population recombination rate  rather than the individual recombination rate   
While results from these methods certainly take in vivo recombination into account  there are other caveats  isolates have often been collected in different hosts sometimes in different geographical regions and sometimes the selective neutrality of sequence variation on which these estimates are based is not clearly established 
Estimates from such studies by essence address the estimation of the recombination rate at a different evolutionary scale Taken together  the currently available information indicates that no viral recombination rate has ever been estimated directly at time and space scales corresponding to a single multi cellular host infection  although this level is most significant for the biology and evolution of viruses 
This study intends to fill this gap by evaluating the recombination frequency of the cauliflower mosaic virus  CaMV  during a single passage in one of its host plants  the turnip Brassica rapa CaMV is a pararetrovirus  which is a major grouping containing hepadnaviruses  e g  hepatitis B virus  badnaviruses  e g  banana streak virus  and caulimoviruses  e g  CaMV 
Pararetroviruses are characterized by a non segmented double stranded DNA genome 
After entering the host cell nucleus  the viral DNA accumulates as a minichromosome   whose transcription is ensured by the host RNA polymerase II   
The CaMV genome consists in approximately   bp and encodes six viral gene products that have been detected in planta  Figure     
Viral proteins P  to P  are expressed from two major transcripts  namely a  S RNA  encoding P  and a  S RNA corresponding to the entire genome and serving as mRNA for proteins P –P    
Using the pre genomic  S RNA as a matrix  the protein P   product of gene V  reverse transcribes the genome into genomic DNA that is concomitantly encapsidated   The detection of CaMV recombinants in turnip hosts has been reported numerous times 
Some studies have demonstrated the appearance of infectious recombinant viral genomes after inoculation  i  of a host plant with two infectious or non infectious parental clones   or  ii  of a transgenic plant containing one CaMV transgene with a CaMV genome missing the corresponding genomic region   
While the former revealed inter genomic viral recombination  the latter demonstrated that CaMV can also recombine with transgenes within the host s genome 
Another study based on phylogenetic analyses of various CaMV strains has clearly suggested different origins for different genomic regions and  hence  multiple recombination events during the evolution of this virus   
Indirect experimental evidence has indicated that  in some cases  CaMV recombination could occur within the host nucleus  between different viral minichromosomes  presumably through the action of the DNA repair cellular machinery   
Nevertheless  the mechanism of  template switching  during reverse transcription  predominant in all retroviruses  most certainly also applies to pararetroviruses 
For this reason  and on the basis of numerous experimental data  CaMV is generally believed to recombine mostly in the cytoplasm of the host cell  by  legal  template switching between two pre genomic RNA molecules    or  illegal  template switching between the  S and the  S RNA   
Under this hypothesis  recombination in CaMV could therefore be considered as operating on a linear template during reverse transcription  with the  ′ and  ′ extremities later ligated to circularize the genomic DNA  position   in Figure  
The above cited studies clearly demonstrate that CaMV is able to recombine 
However  since these studies are based on complementation techniques  non quantitative detection  or phylogenetically based inferences of recombination  they do not inform us on whether recombination is an exceptional event or an  everyday  process shaping the genetic composition of CaMV populations In the present work  we aimed at answering this question 
To this end  we have constructed a CaMV genome with four genetic markers  demonstrated to be neutral in competition experiments 
By co inoculating host plants with equal amounts of wild type and marker containing CaMV particles  we have generated mixed populations in which impressive proportions of recombinants distributed in several different classes corresponding to exchange of different genomic regions have been detected and quantified 
Altogether  the recombinant genomes averaged over   of the population 
Further analysis of these data  assuming a number of viral replications during the infection period ranging from five to   indicates that the per nucleotide per replication cycle recombination rate of CaMV is of the same order of magnitude  i e  on the order of a few   across the entire genome 
We thereby provide the first quantification  to our knowledge  of the recombination rate in a virus population during a single passage in a single host From Figure   and supposing that all marker containing genomic regions can recombine  we could predict the detection and quantification of seven classes of recombinant genotypes   bcd a  a cd b  ab d c  abc d   cd ab  a d bc  and a c b d 
Indeed  all classes were detected  and their frequencies in the ten CaMV populations analyzed are summarized in Table  Altogether  the proportion of recombinant genomes found in the mixed viral populations was astonishingly high and very similar in the ten co infected plants analyzed  Table   last column  ranging between    plant   to    plants     and   with a mean frequency   standard error  of      
This result indicates that recombination events are very frequent during the invasion of the host plant by CaMV and represents  to our knowledge  the first direct quantification of viral recombination during the infection of a live multi cellular host The inferred per generation recombination and interference rates  assuming that CaMV undergoes ten replication cycles during the   d between infection and sampling  are given for each of the ten plants in Table  
Recombination rates between adjacent markers are large  on the order of   to  
Taking the distance in nucleotides between markers into account yields an average recombination rate per nucleotide and generation on the order of      
Interestingly  this recombination rate does not vary throughout the genome  Kruskal–Wallis test  p    To relax the assumption of the number of replications during the   d  we calculated the recombination parameters assuming five or   generations 
The effect of the number of generations on the estimates is linear  doubling the number of generations results in a halving of the recombination rate  detailed results not shown 
For example  the average recombination rates r
  r
  and r
  assuming   generations were equal to     and   respectively  compare with values in Table   yielding per nucleotide per generation recombination rates of             and      Inspection of Table   also shows that first order interference coefficients were in general negative  indicating that a crossing over in one genomic segment increases the probability that a crossing over will occur in another genomic segment  while the second order coefficient parameter had an average value close to zero with a large variance 
The mechanism leading to these results will be discussed in the following section One major breakthrough in the work presented here lies in the space and time scales at which the experiments were performed 
Indeed  the processes occurring within the course of a single infection of one multi cellular host are of obvious biological relevance for any disease 
Previous studies on viral recombination suffered from major drawbacks in this respect  basing their conclusions on experiments relying on complementation among non infectious viruses or between viruses with undetermined relative fitness  on phylogenetically based analyses  or on experiments in cell cultures 
For reasons detailed in the Introduction  the first two methods either do not provide information on the frequency of recombination  but only its occurrence  or address the question at a different temporal  and often spatial  scale 
Results from cell cultures  on the other hand  impose cell co infection by different viral variants  potentially overestimating the frequency of recombination events 
Our study circumvents these limitations by analyzing viral genotypes sampled from infected plants after the course of a single infection  and therefore the invasion and co infection of cells in various organs and tissues is very close to natural More than half of the genomes       see Table   present in a CaMV population after a single passage in its host plant were identified as recombinants  and these data allowed us to infer a per nucleotide per generation recombination rate on the order of       to      
The time length of one generation  i e  the time required for a given genome to go from one replication to the next  is totally unknown in plant viruses 
The only experimental data available on CaMV are based on the kinetics of gene expression in infected protoplasts  where the capsid protein is produced between   and   h   
The reverse transcription and the encapsidation of genomic DNA being two coupled phenomena    we judged it reasonable to assume a generation time of   d and  thus  an average of ten generations during our experiments 
In case this estimate is mistaken  we have verified a linear relationship between r and the number of generations  thereby allowing an immediate adjustment of r if the CaMV generation time is more precisely established 
At this point  we must consider that all cloned genomes may not have been through all the successive replication events potentially allowed by the timing of our experiments 
It was previously shown that about   of CaMV mature virus particles accumulate in compact inclusion bodies    where they may be sequestered for a long time  as such inclusions are very frequent in all infected cells  including those in leaves that have been invaded by the virus population for several weeks 
The viral population may thus present an age structure that could bias the estimation of the recombination rate 
In order to minimize this bias  the clones we analyzed were collected in one young newly formed leaf  where the chances of finding genomes from  unsequestered lines  were assumed to be higher 
In any case  our data analysis is conservative  since this age structure can only lead to an underestimation of the recombination rate Our results show that interferences between pairs of loci are negative  a recombination event between two loci apparently increases the probability of recombination between another pair of loci 
We believe that the most parsimonious explanation of these negative interferences is based on the way the infection builds up within plant hosts 
Indeed  one can divide infected host cells into those infected by a single virus genotype and those infected by more than one viral genotype 
In the former  analogous to clonal propagation  recombination is undetectable 
In the latter  recombination is not only detectable but  as our results indicate  very frequent 
Samples consisting of viruses resulting from a mixture of these two types of host cell infections will thus contain viruses with no recombination and viruses with several recombination events  thus yielding an impression of negative interference 
These conceptual arguments are supported by mathematical models 
It is indeed easy to show  detailed results not shown  that if a proportion F of the population reproduces clonally  analogous to single infections  while the remaining reproduces panmictically  negative interferences could be inferred even if they do not exist 
For example  assuming a three locus model with real recombination rates r
  and r
  and interference i
  the  apparent  recombination and interference parameters  would be r
        F r  r
        F r
  and i
     F   i
    F 
Interestingly  this example also shows that our estimates of the recombination rate are conservative  that a fraction F of host cells are singly infected while others are multiply infected leads to an underestimation of the recombination rate As judged by r
  r
  and r
  calculated between markers a–b  b–c  and c–d  respectively  we found evidence for recombination through the entire CaMV genome 
The values for r
 
r
  and r
  are remarkably similar  hence the recombination sites seem to be evenly distributed along the genome 
We considered the template switching model as the major way recombinants are created in CaMV 
As already mentioned in the Introduction  hot spots of template switching have been predicted at the position of the  ′ extremities of the  S and  S RNAs   
If other recombination mechanisms  such as that associated with second strand DNA synthesis or with the host cell DNA repair machinery  act significantly  hot spots would be expected at the positions of the sequence interruption     and     
Due to the design of our experiment and the position of the four markers  we have no information on putative hot spots at positions corresponding to the  ′ end of the  S RNA and to    at nucleotide position  
Nevertheless  the putative hot spots at the  ′ end of the  S RNA and at   and    nucleotide positions   and   respectively  fall between marker pairs c–d  b–c  and a–b  respectively 
Our results indicate that either these hot spots are quantitatively equivalent though predicted by different recombination mechanisms or  more likely  that they simply do not exist 
Whatever the explanation  what we observe is that the CaMV can exchange any portion of its genome  and thus any gene thereof  with an astonishingly high frequency during the course of a single host infection To our knowledge  the viral recombination rate has never previously been quantified experimentally for a plant virus   
In contrast  retroviruses and particularly HIV  have been extensively investigated in that sense 
As we have already discussed for these latter cases  the quantification of the intrinsic recombination rate was carried out in artificially co infected cell cultures 
The estimated intrinsic per nucleotide per generation recombination rate in HIV  is on the order of      less than one order of magnitude higher than our estimation for CaMV 
Because for various reasons detailed above we probably underestimate the within host CaMV recombination rate  we believe that the intrinsic recombination rate in CaMV is higher and perhaps on the order of that of HIV Other pararetroviruses such as plant badnaviruses or vertebrate hepadnaviruses have a similar cycle within their host cells  including steps of nuclear minichromosome  genomic size RNA synthesis  and reverse transcription and encapsidation 
Nevertheless  vertebrate hepadnaviruses  e g  hepatitis B virus  infect hosts that are very different from plants in their biology and physiology  and this could lead to a totally different frequency of cell co infection during the development of the virus populations 
Thus  even though our results can be informative for other pararetroviruses because of the viruses  shared biological characteristics  they should not be extrapolated to vertebrate pararetroviruses without caution We used the plasmid pCa  which is the complete genome of the CaMV isolate Cabb S  cloned into the pBR  plasmid at the unique SalI restriction site   
To analyze recombination in different regions of the genome  we introduced four genetic markers  a  b  c  and d  at the positions       and   respectively  thus approximately at four cardinal points of the CaMV circular double stranded DNA of   bp  Figure  
All markers  each corresponding to a single nucleotide change  were introduced by PCR directed mutagenesis in pCa  and resulted in the duplication of previously unique restriction sites BsiWI  PstI  MluI  and SacI in a plasmid designated pMark S  Because  in this study  we targeted the possible exchange of genes between viral genomes  all markers a  b  c  and d were introduced within coding regions corresponding to open reading frames I  IV  V  and VI  respectively 
Another important concern was to quantify recombination in the absence of selection  i e  to create neutral markers 
Consequently all markers consist of synonymous mutations  see below To generate the parental virus particles  plasmids pCa  and pMark S were mechanically inoculated into individual plants as previously described   
All plants were turnips  B  rapa cv   Just Right  grown under glasshouse conditions at   °C with a    light dark  photoperiod 
Thirty days post inoculation  all symptomatic leaves were harvested and viral particles were purified as described earlier   The resulting preparations of parental viruses  designated Cabb S and Mark S  were quantified by spectrometry using the formula described by Hull et al 
  
We fixed the initial frequency of markers to a value of   and a solution containing   mg ml of virus particles of both Cabb S and Mark S at a   ratio was prepared 
Plantlets were co infected by mechanical inoculation of two to three leaves with   μl of this virus solution  using abrasive Celite AFA  Fluka  Ronkonkoma  New York  United States 
The mixed CaMV population was allowed to grow during   d of systemic infection We designed an experimental protocol for quantifying marker frequency within a mixed Cabb S Mark S virus population after a single passage in a host plant 
Twenty four individual plants  inoculated as above with equal amounts of Cabb S and Mark S  were harvested   d post inoculation  when symptoms were fully developed 
The viral DNA was purified from   mg of young newly formed infected leaves according to the protocol described previously   
After the precipitation step of this protocol  the viral DNA was resuspended and further purified with the Wizard DNA clean up kit  Promega  Fitchburg  Wisconsin  United States  in TE  X   mM Tris HCl and   mM EDTA  pH   
Aliquots of viral DNA preparations were digested by restriction enzymes corresponding either to marker a  b  c  or d and submitted to a   agarose gel electrophoresis  colored by ethydium bromide and exposed to UV 
Each individual restriction enzyme cut once in Cabb S DNA and twice in Mark S  thus generating DNA fragments of different sizes attributable to one or the other in the mixed population of CaMV genomes 
After scanning the agarose gels  we estimated the relative frequency of the two genotypes in each viral DNA preparation and at each marker position  by densitometry using the NIH   Image program 
The statistical analyses of the frequency of the four markers are described below To identify and quantify the recombinants within the CaMV mixed populations  aliquots from ten of the   viral DNA preparations described above were digested by the restriction enzyme SalI  and directly cloned into pUC  at the corresponding site 
In each of the ten viral populations analyzed    full genome length clones were digested separately by BsiWI  PstI  MluI  and SacI  to test for the presence of marker a  b  c  and d  respectively 
In this experiment  with the marker representing an additional restriction site  we could easily distinguish between the Cabb S and the Mark S genotype at all four marker positions  upon agarose gel   electrophoresis of the digested clones 
Clones with none or all four markers were parental genotypes  whereas clones harboring     or   markers were clearly recombinants 
Due to the very high number of recombinants detected  markers eventually appearing or disappearing due to spontaneous mutations were neglected Here we present the different methods we used to quantify recombination in the CaMV genome 
Because all these methods assume that the different markers are neutral  we first discuss assumption We used two datasets to test the neutrality of markers  both resulting from plants co infected with a   ratio of Mark S and Cabb S 
The first consisted of viral DNA densitometry data derived from   plants  described above  where for each plant we have an estimate of the frequency of each marker in the genome population 
The second consisted of the restriction of   individual full genome length viral clones obtained from one co infected plant  described above  yielding an estimate of the frequency of each marker  and this was repeated on ten different plants 
The frequencies of the different markers were       and   for markers a  b  c  and d in the first dataset and       and   in the second dataset 
We tested whether these frequencies were significantly different from the expected value under neutrality    using either t tests  for datasets where normality could not be rejected  seven out of eight cases  or Wilcoxon signed rank non parametric tests otherwise  marker c in the first dataset 
In all cases p values were larger than  There are several cautionary remarks regarding these analyses 
First  in all cases we found an excess of markers 
Unfortunately  the two datasets cannot be regarded as independent because  even though the methods through which the frequency estimates were obtained were different  the plants used in the second dataset were a subset of the plants of the first 
We thus have only four independent estimates in each case  and there is minimal power to detect significant deviations from neutrality with such a small sample size 
It should be noted at this stage that deviations from the expected value could also be caused either by slight deviations from the   ratio in the infecting mixed solution  or by deviations from that ratio in the frequency of the viral particles that actually get into the plants 
Second  because of the relatively small sample sizes and low statistical power  the tests presented above could have detected only large deviations The results clearly show  however  precisely that the markers do not have large effects  if any  and that therefore recombination estimates would be affected only very slightly by any hypothetical selective effects of the markers 
Because of this  along with the fact that the introduced markers provoke silent substitutions in the CaMV genome  we assumed that markers were effectively neutral in the rest of the analysis The dataset used to estimate the recombination frequency consisted of the   full genome length viral clones   from each of ten co infected plants  individually genotyped for each of the four markers 
As discussed in detail in the Results  recombination was very frequent and concerned all four markers 
Indeed  approximately half of the genotyped clones exhibited a recombinant genotype 
It was therefore meaningful to try to obtain quantitative estimates of recombination from our data Our aim was to analyze viral recombination in a live host 
Consequently  we had to deal with the fact that more than one viral replication cycle occurred during the   d that infection lasted in our experiment  we had to wait that long for the disease to develop and to be able to recover sufficient amounts of viral DNA from each infection 
Based on the kinetics of gene expression    we postulate that each replication cycle lasts between   and   d  and that therefore seven to ten cycles occurred between infection and the sampling time 
In case this assumption is incorrect  we did calculations assuming five  seven  ten  or   replication cycles during these   d  As shown  the results were not affected qualitatively  and only slightly quantitatively 
It is important to note that we assumed that recombination occurred through a template switching mechanism  and that therefore  from a recombination point of view  the CaMV genome is linear 
The reverse transcription starts and finishes at the position   in Figure   which is the point of circularization of the DNA genome 
This implies that changes between contiguous markers a–b  b–c  and c–d can be considered as true recombination whereas those between a and d cannot  as they may simply stem from circularization of DNA  during the synthesis of which the polymerase has switched template once anywhere between a–b  b–c  or c–d To estimate the recombination rate between markers  we wrote recurrence equations describing the change in frequency of each genotype over one generation  assuming random mating and no selection  i e  the standard Wright–Fisher population genetics model 
We then expressed the frequency of all possible genotypes n generations later as a function of their initial frequency and of the recombination parameters 
Subsequently we calculated the maximum likelihood estimates of the recombination parameters and their asymptotic variances given initial frequencies  we assumed that the two  parental  genotypes  Mark S and Cabb S  had equal initial frequencies of   and that all other genotypes had initial frequencies of zero  and frequencies after n generations  the observed frequencies  as stated above we used different values of n 
All algebraic and numerical calculations were carried out with the software Mathematica The recombination parameters are the recombination rates between two adjacent loci  e g  r
  for the recombination rate between markers a and b  and the interference coefficients  e g  i
  for interference between recombination events in the segments between markers a and b and b and c  To define these parameters we followed Christiansen    and in particular the recombination distributions for two  three  and four loci  respectively  Tables     and   of   
It is important to realize that given the definitions of these parameters  the estimator of the recombination rate between two loci is not affected by the number of loci considered 
In other words  we obtain the same estimation of the recombination rate between markers a and b whether we consider genotypic frequencies at just these two loci  or the frequencies at these two loci plus a third locus  or the complete information to which we have access  the four marker genotypes 
Information on additional loci only affects the estimates of the interference coefficients It proved impossible to carry out the calculations for four loci algebraically 
Instead  we used a computer program to calculate the expected genotypic frequencies at all four loci after n generations  given the above stated initial frequencies and specified recombination parameters 
For each combination of recombination parameters we calculated a Euclidean distance between the vector of the expected genotypic frequencies and the observed genotypic frequencies  and considered that the estimated recombination parameters were those yielding the minimal Euclidean distance 
In all cases  the estimated recombination rates between pairs of loci were equal to the second decimal to those estimated algebraically from data for three or two loci Recombination Every Day  Abundant Recombination in a Virus during a Single Multi Cellular Host InfectionAs increasing numbers of full length viral sequences become available  recombinant or mosaic viruses are being recognized more frequently

Our study circumvents these limitations by analyzing viral genotypes sampled from infected plants after the course of a single infection  and therefore the invasion and co infection of cells in various organs and tissues is very close to natural More than half of the genomes       see Table   present in a CaMV population after a single passage in its host plant were identified as recombinants  and these data allowed us to infer a per nucleotide per generation recombination rate on the order of       to      
The time length of one generation  i e  the time required for a given genome to go from one replication to the next  is totally unknown in plant viruses 
The only experimental data available on CaMV are based on the kinetics of gene expression in infected protoplasts  where the capsid protein is produced between   and   h   
The reverse transcription and the encapsidation of genomic DNA being two coupled phenomena    we judged it reasonable to assume a generation time of   d and  thus  an average of ten generations during our experiments 
In case this estimate is mistaken  we have verified a linear relationship between r and the number of generations  thereby allowing an immediate adjustment of r if the CaMV generation time is more precisely established 
At this point  we must consider that all cloned genomes may not have been through all the successive replication events potentially allowed by the timing of our experiments 
It was previously shown that about   of CaMV mature virus particles accumulate in compact inclusion bodies    where they may be sequestered for a long time  as such inclusions are very frequent in all infected cells  including those in leaves that have been invaded by the virus population for several weeks 
The viral population may thus present an age structure that could bias the estimation of the recombination rate 
In order to minimize this bias  the clones we analyzed were collected in one young newly formed leaf  where the chances of finding genomes from  unsequestered lines  were assumed to be higher 
In any case  our data analysis is conservative  since this age structure can only lead to an underestimation of the recombination rate Our results show that interferences between pairs of loci are negative  a recombination event between two loci apparently increases the probability of recombination between another pair of loci 
We believe that the most parsimonious explanation of these negative interferences is based on the way the infection builds up within plant hosts 
Indeed  one can divide infected host cells into those infected by a single virus genotype and those infected by more than one viral genotype 
In the former  analogous to clonal propagation  recombination is undetectable 
In the latter  recombination is not only detectable but  as our results indicate  very frequent 
Samples consisting of viruses resulting from a mixture of these two types of host cell infections will thus contain viruses with no recombination and viruses with several recombination events  thus yielding an impression of negative interference 
These conceptual arguments are supported by mathematical models 
It is indeed easy to show  detailed results not shown  that if a proportion F of the population reproduces clonally  analogous to single infections  while the remaining reproduces panmictically  negative interferences could be inferred even if they do not exist 
For example  assuming a three locus model with real recombination rates r
  and r
  and interference i
  the  apparent  recombination and interference parameters  would be r
        F r  r
        F r
  and i
     F   i
    F 
Interestingly  this example also shows that our estimates of the recombination rate are conservative  that a fraction F of host cells are singly infected while others are multiply infected leads to an underestimation of the recombination rate As judged by r
  r
  and r
  calculated between markers a–b  b–c  and c–d  respectively  we found evidence for recombination through the entire CaMV genome 
The values for r
 
r
  and r
  are remarkably similar  hence the recombination sites seem to be evenly distributed along the genome 
We considered the template switching model as the major way recombinants are created in CaMV 
As already mentioned in the Introduction  hot spots of template switching have been predicted at the position of the  ′ extremities of the  S and  S RNAs   
If other recombination mechanisms  such as that associated with second strand DNA synthesis or with the host cell DNA repair machinery  act significantly  hot spots would be expected at the positions of the sequence interruption     and     
Due to the design of our experiment and the position of the four markers  we have no information on putative hot spots at positions corresponding to the  ′ end of the  S RNA and to    at nucleotide position  
Nevertheless  the putative hot spots at the  ′ end of the  S RNA and at   and    nucleotide positions   and   respectively  fall between marker pairs c–d  b–c  and a–b  respectively 
Our results indicate that either these hot spots are quantitatively equivalent though predicted by different recombination mechanisms or  more likely  that they simply do not exist 
Whatever the explanation  what we observe is that the CaMV can exchange any portion of its genome  and thus any gene thereof  with an astonishingly high frequency during the course of a single host infection To our knowledge  the viral recombination rate has never previously been quantified experimentally for a plant virus   
In contrast  retroviruses and particularly HIV  have been extensively investigated in that sense 
As we have already discussed for these latter cases  the quantification of the intrinsic recombination rate was carried out in artificially co infected cell cultures 
The estimated intrinsic per nucleotide per generation recombination rate in HIV  is on the order of      less than one order of magnitude higher than our estimation for CaMV 
Because for various reasons detailed above we probably underestimate the within host CaMV recombination rate  we believe that the intrinsic recombination rate in CaMV is higher and perhaps on the order of that of HIV Other pararetroviruses such as plant badnaviruses or vertebrate hepadnaviruses have a similar cycle within their host cells  including steps of nuclear minichromosome  genomic size RNA synthesis  and reverse transcription and encapsidation 
Nevertheless  vertebrate hepadnaviruses  e g  hepatitis B virus  infect hosts that are very different from plants in their biology and physiology  and this could lead to a totally different frequency of cell co infection during the development of the virus populations 
Thus  even though our results can be informative for other pararetroviruses because of the viruses  shared biological characteristics  they should not be extrapolated to vertebrate pararetroviruses without caution We used the plasmid pCa  which is the complete genome of the CaMV isolate Cabb S  cloned into the pBR  plasmid at the unique SalI restriction site   
To analyze recombination in different regions of the genome  we introduced four genetic markers  a  b  c  and d  at the positions       and   respectively  thus approximately at four cardinal points of the CaMV circular double stranded DNA of   bp  Figure  
All markers  each corresponding to a single nucleotide change  were introduced by PCR directed mutagenesis in pCa  and resulted in the duplication of previously unique restriction sites BsiWI  PstI  MluI  and SacI in a plasmid designated pMark S  Because  in this study  we targeted the possible exchange of genes between viral genomes  all markers a  b  c  and d were introduced within coding regions corresponding to open reading frames I  IV  V  and VI  respectively 
Another important concern was to quantify recombination in the absence of selection  i e  to create neutral markers 
Consequently all markers consist of synonymous mutations  see below To generate the parental virus particles  plasmids pCa  and pMark S were mechanically inoculated into individual plants as previously described   
All plants were turnips  B  rapa cv   Just Right  grown under glasshouse conditions at   °C with a    light dark  photoperiod 
Thirty days post inoculation  all symptomatic leaves were harvested and viral particles were purified as described earlier   The resulting preparations of parental viruses  designated Cabb S and Mark S  were quantified by spectrometry using the formula described by Hull et al 
  
We fixed the initial frequency of markers to a value of   and a solution containing   mg ml of virus particles of both Cabb S and Mark S at a   ratio was prepared 
Plantlets were co infected by mechanical inoculation of two to three leaves with   μl of this virus solution  using abrasive Celite AFA  Fluka  Ronkonkoma  New York  United States 
The mixed CaMV population was allowed to grow during   d of systemic infection We designed an experimental protocol for quantifying marker frequency within a mixed Cabb S Mark S virus population after a single passage in a host plant 
Twenty four individual plants  inoculated as above with equal amounts of Cabb S and Mark S  were harvested   d post inoculation  when symptoms were fully developed 
The viral DNA was purified from   mg of young newly formed infected leaves according to the protocol described previously   
After the precipitation step of this protocol  the viral DNA was resuspended and further purified with the Wizard DNA clean up kit  Promega  Fitchburg  Wisconsin  United States  in TE  X   mM Tris HCl and   mM EDTA  pH   
Aliquots of viral DNA preparations were digested by restriction enzymes corresponding either to marker a  b  c  or d and submitted to a   agarose gel electrophoresis  colored by ethydium bromide and exposed to UV 
Each individual restriction enzyme cut once in Cabb S DNA and twice in Mark S  thus generating DNA fragments of different sizes attributable to one or the other in the mixed population of CaMV genomes 
After scanning the agarose gels  we estimated the relative frequency of the two genotypes in each viral DNA preparation and at each marker position  by densitometry using the NIH   Image program 
The statistical analyses of the frequency of the four markers are described below To identify and quantify the recombinants within the CaMV mixed populations  aliquots from ten of the   viral DNA preparations described above were digested by the restriction enzyme SalI  and directly cloned into pUC  at the corresponding site 
In each of the ten viral populations analyzed    full genome length clones were digested separately by BsiWI  PstI  MluI  and SacI  to test for the presence of marker a  b  c  and d  respectively 
In this experiment  with the marker representing an additional restriction site  we could easily distinguish between the Cabb S and the Mark S genotype at all four marker positions  upon agarose gel   electrophoresis of the digested clones 
Clones with none or all four markers were parental genotypes  whereas clones harboring     or   markers were clearly recombinants 
Due to the very high number of recombinants detected  markers eventually appearing or disappearing due to spontaneous mutations were neglected Here we present the different methods we used to quantify recombination in the CaMV genome 
Because all these methods assume that the different markers are neutral  we first discuss assumption We used two datasets to test the neutrality of markers  both resulting from plants co infected with a   ratio of Mark S and Cabb S 
The first consisted of viral DNA densitometry data derived from   plants  described above  where for each plant we have an estimate of the frequency of each marker in the genome population 
The second consisted of the restriction of   individual full genome length viral clones obtained from one co infected plant  described above  yielding an estimate of the frequency of each marker  and this was repeated on ten different plants 
The frequencies of the different markers were       and   for markers a  b  c  and d in the first dataset and       and   in the second dataset 
We tested whether these frequencies were significantly different from the expected value under neutrality    using either t tests  for datasets where normality could not be rejected  seven out of eight cases  or Wilcoxon signed rank non parametric tests otherwise  marker c in the first dataset 
In all cases p values were larger than  There are several cautionary remarks regarding these analyses 
First  in all cases we found an excess of markers 
Unfortunately  the two datasets cannot be regarded as independent because  even though the methods through which the frequency estimates were obtained were different  the plants used in the second dataset were a subset of the plants of the first 
We thus have only four independent estimates in each case  and there is minimal power to detect significant deviations from neutrality with such a small sample size 
It should be noted at this stage that deviations from the expected value could also be caused either by slight deviations from the   ratio in the infecting mixed solution  or by deviations from that ratio in the frequency of the viral particles that actually get into the plants 
Second  because of the relatively small sample sizes and low statistical power  the tests presented above could have detected only large deviations The results clearly show  however  precisely that the markers do not have large effects  if any  and that therefore recombination estimates would be affected only very slightly by any hypothetical selective effects of the markers 
Because of this  along with the fact that the introduced markers provoke silent substitutions in the CaMV genome  we assumed that markers were effectively neutral in the rest of the analysis The dataset used to estimate the recombination frequency consisted of the   full genome length viral clones   from each of ten co infected plants  individually genotyped for each of the four markers 
As discussed in detail in the Results  recombination was very frequent and concerned all four markers 
Indeed  approximately half of the genotyped clones exhibited a recombinant genotype 
It was therefore meaningful to try to obtain quantitative estimates of recombination from our data Our aim was to analyze viral recombination in a live host 
Consequently  we had to deal with the fact that more than one viral replication cycle occurred during the   d that infection lasted in our experiment  we had to wait that long for the disease to develop and to be able to recover sufficient amounts of viral DNA from each infection 
Based on the kinetics of gene expression    we postulate that each replication cycle lasts between   and   d  and that therefore seven to ten cycles occurred between infection and the sampling time 
In case this assumption is incorrect  we did calculations assuming five  seven  ten  or   replication cycles during these   d  As shown  the results were not affected qualitatively  and only slightly quantitatively 
It is important to note that we assumed that recombination occurred through a template switching mechanism  and that therefore  from a recombination point of view  the CaMV genome is linear 
The reverse transcription starts and finishes at the position   in Figure   which is the point of circularization of the DNA genome 
This implies that changes between contiguous markers a–b  b–c  and c–d can be considered as true recombination whereas those between a and d cannot  as they may simply stem from circularization of DNA  during the synthesis of which the polymerase has switched template once anywhere between a–b  b–c  or c–d To estimate the recombination rate between markers  we wrote recurrence equations describing the change in frequency of each genotype over one generation  assuming random mating and no selection  i e  the standard Wright–Fisher population genetics model 
We then expressed the frequency of all possible genotypes n generations later as a function of their initial frequency and of the recombination parameters 
Subsequently we calculated the maximum likelihood estimates of the recombination parameters and their asymptotic variances given initial frequencies  we assumed that the two  parental  genotypes  Mark S and Cabb S  had equal initial frequencies of   and that all other genotypes had initial frequencies of zero  and frequencies after n generations  the observed frequencies  as stated above we used different values of n 
All algebraic and numerical calculations were carried out with the software Mathematica The recombination parameters are the recombination rates between two adjacent loci  e g  r
  for the recombination rate between markers a and b  and the interference coefficients  e g  i
  for interference between recombination events in the segments between markers a and b and b and c  To define these parameters we followed Christiansen    and in particular the recombination distributions for two  three  and four loci  respectively  Tables     and   of   
It is important to realize that given the definitions of these parameters  the estimator of the recombination rate between two loci is not affected by the number of loci considered 
In other words  we obtain the same estimation of the recombination rate between markers a and b whether we consider genotypic frequencies at just these two loci  or the frequencies at these two loci plus a third locus  or the complete information to which we have access  the four marker genotypes 
Information on additional loci only affects the estimates of the interference coefficients It proved impossible to carry out the calculations for four loci algebraically 
Instead  we used a computer program to calculate the expected genotypic frequencies at all four loci after n generations  given the above stated initial frequencies and specified recombination parameters 
For each combination of recombination parameters we calculated a Euclidean distance between the vector of the expected genotypic frequencies and the observed genotypic frequencies  and considered that the estimated recombination parameters were those yielding the minimal Euclidean distance 
In all cases  the estimated recombination rates between pairs of loci were equal to the second decimal to those estimated algebraically from data for three or two loci Tumor Restrictions to Oncolytic VirusIn most solid tumors the tumor interior displays a high cellular density with multiple cell types  both malignant and normal  stromal  cells  interdigitated by strands of extracellular matrix  ECM  and other poorly defined tissue 
Stromal cells typically consist of fibroblasts  macrophages  neutrophils and other immune cell types 
Tumor associated fibroblasts are a source of the bulk acellular tissue in tumors    which is largely made up of polysugars and glycoproteins  such as collagens  laminins  fibronectins  proteoglycans  hyaluronan and water  forming a dense matrix around and between the cancer cells   
This matrix provides structural support but also haptotactic and chemotactic guidance for cancer cells   
Moreover  the prevailing tumor interstitium is rich in soluble angiogenic factors  such as members of the vascular endothelial growth factor  VEGF  family    cellular growth factors  including endothelial growth factor  EGF  basic fibroblast growth factor  FGF  platelet derived growth factor  PDGF  and pleiotrophic factors  particularly transforming growth factor  TGF  beta   
Additionally  both tumor  and stromal cells secrete cytokines and chemokines  such as interleukin  IL    IL   tumor necrosis factor  TNF  alpha  stromal cell derived factor  SDF    macrophage migration inhibitory factor  MIF    which on one hand recruit more stromal and progenitor cells into the tumors and on the other hand curb the activity of antigen presenting cells and anti tumor T cells   
In several independent cancer types  high serum levels of IL   and IL   are indicators of poor prognosis   Aberrant tumor and stromal growth combined with an overproduction of matrix leads to high interstitial pressure in the tumor  preventing lateral diffusion of therapeutic compounds within the tumor 
Tight cellular compactness combined with a high tumor proliferation rate also causes physical crowding and puts constraints on oxygenation  which due to aberrant angiogenesis and rupture of the haphazard vessels is mostly incomplete and results in chronic tissue hypoxia toward the tumor cores 
As cancer cells exist in a crowding hypoxic  and cytokine growth factor perpetuated chronic state of stress  they upregulate a number of key cellular molecules that function as a collective defense against a wide range of therapies  including oncolytic viruses 
The properties of oncolytic viruses and their status in clinical development as well as various delivery options have been reviewed elsewhere   
In this review  we provide an overview of two of the main intratumoral barriers to oncolytic virus spread  the extracellular tumor make up and the intracellular antiviral defense mechanisms Tumor cellular structure and composition may in concert with abundant extracellular matrix  ECM  deposition pose a severe hurdle for systemic virus entry and propagation of infection within the tumor 
The extracellular matrix is a complex dense network consisting of multiple proteins  glycoproteins and polysaccharides including collagens  laminins  fibronectins  proteoglycans and hyaluronic acid   
The interstitial fluid pressure  IFP  in the tumor surrounding blood and lymphatic vessels is mainly created by the high cell density that forms an increased physical pressure outwards and does not allow free diffusion of therapeutics   
A high IFP generally predicts an aggressive tumor phenotype as tumor cells tend to escape from tumor margins where the pressure drops  thus facilitating spread of metastatic cells   
On the other hand  for therapeutic virus  interstitial fluid concentration gradients may pose a hurdle as passive diffusion in viable regions  typically the rim  may occur mainly outward   
Given the limited arsenal of known chemicals alleviating tumor compactness and the poor penetration drugs in general into the tumor tissue  this is a considerable problem that may not be easy to tackle 
Some strategies are discussed below Viruses are passive particles and rely either on radial cell to cell spread or on soluble diffusion across concentration gradients to reach their target cells and to propagate the infection 
Tumor matrix is critical in this regard  as it can block both forms of spread 
Passively diffusing viruses may physically not fit through the strands of the ECM 
This was shown for oncolytic herpes virus  which has an outer diameter of over   nm  and whose spreading could be improved by matrix degrading bacterial collagenase co injection   
Bilbao and coworkers showed that adenovirus entry into experimental hepatocellular carcinoma nodules in the livers of immunocompetent rats following intravenous or intraportal injection was directly related to the thickness of the ECM capsule enveloping the nodules   
On the other hand  we found using Semliki Forest virus  which has an outer diameter of about   nm  that even upon intratumoral injection spread was blocked by ECM  which formed a physical barrier for virus infection  Figure  The foremost option to reduce interstitial fluid pressure and to remove physical molecule barriers imposed by the ECM is to use matrix degrading enzymes 
These act by digesting collagen  fibrin  and other types of fibrillar matrix deposits  creating more space between cell clusters  and glycosaminoglycan polymers  known to limit fluid movement in tumors 
Simultaneously  such strategies may also expose more cell surface to viruses  increasing the likelihood of infection 
In a study by Kuriyama  trypsin or collagenase dispase was injected into subcutaneous U  and U  glioma xenografts in immunocompromised mice  followed by a reporter adenovirus   
Both types of ECM degrading enzymes increased tumor transduction by the virus  but when doses got too high  transduction efficacy suffered  demonstrating a balance between ECM degradation and oncolytic virus efficacy 
In another study  treatment of PC  tumors with vaccinia virus producing matrix metalloprotease  MMP    resulted in reduction of collagen IV fibrils and increase in virus penetration into tumor  which yielded elevated virus titers   
Hong et al 
targeted orthotopic neuroblastoma xenografts engineered to express MMP  with oncolytic HSV  achieving increased virus distribution compared to control tumors   
Similar results were obtained when human soft tissue sarcoma HSTS T overexpressing MMP  or MMP  were injected with oncolytic HSV   
MMP expressing tumors contained significantly less sulfated glycosaminoglycans compared to control tumors 
Other enzymes and protein effectors  either engineered into virus expression cassettes or provided exogenously  include hyaluronidase  decorin  various other MMPs  and notably relaxin a peptide hormone normally expressed during particular phase of pregnancy that does not possess tissue degrading activity itself  but instead induces a number of key collagen degrading proteases seemingly in a tumor specific manner   
Beyer showed that relaxin expressed by murine stem cells improved trastuzumab penetrance and therapy outcome in syngeneic tumor models   
In another study  chimeric adenovirus Ad  expressing relaxin showed increased tumor transduction and virus dissemination   Several other strategies to increase penetration of therapeutics in tumors have been developed   
While the stromal ECM capsule of tumor nodules acts as a physical barrier to virus entry following intravenous injection  it was possible to improve tumor infection by administering vaso active compounds  angiotensin II  histamine  nitroglycerine  before the virus   
This is interesting  as vasculature per se would not be expected to alter or influence the physical composition of the ECM  such as collagen strand thickness 
Instead  virus access to the tumor was improved  most likely by increased access from the blood via tumor stromal adjoining vessels 
Interestingly  in a study with oncolytic herpes virus  anti VEGF monoclonal antibody Bevacizumab given before intravenous virus injection gave poorer anti tumor efficacy than when given after the virus   
The study showed that while HSV is able to enter and infect tumors better through their leaky vasculature compared to Bevacizumab normalized vasculature  vascular normalization by Bevacizumab still gave superior combination efficacy when the virus was already in the tumor 
This effect was likely dependent on altering both physical and biological properties of the tumor  including interstitial pressure and oxygenation 
In another study  anti VEGF A antibody injections in nude mice harboring U  human glioma xenografts led to an increase in MMP  expression and reduction in collagen fiber content  facilitating improved distribution of oncolytic adenovirus within the tumor tissue   
In general  targeting tumor vasculature by oncolytic viruses and including agents that affect tumor vasculature in combination regimens is gaining interest    and it will be interesting to see more specific studies on how vascular acting agents may affect the physical barriers to oncolytic viruses Some viruses do not need an extracellular step for propagating infection  such as members of the herpes and poxvirus families  and may be able to spread from cell to cell 
For example  HSV  is able to infect neighboring cells via lateral tight junctions in a manner dependent on its glycoproteins E and I   
Vaccinia virus  on the other hand  induces so called actin tails  which are actin filament driven membranous protrusions of the plasma membrane harboring a single virus particle at the outer tip 
These actin tails actively deliver and deposit virus particles onto or even into neighboring cells   
Because lateral spread without an extracellular step may circumvent neutralizing immunity as well as some of the physical obstacles the tumor microenvironment imposes  this ability has been engineered into viruses that normally do not possess it 
A promising strategy is to engineer OVs to express membrane fusogenic genes  MFGs  such as gibbon ape leukemia virus  GALV  glycoprotein  reptilian reovirus p  protein  FAST  or the membrane glycoproteins H and F of measles virus   
Quite intriguingly  expression of several different MFGs by oncolytic adenovirus synergized with chemotherapy in anti tumor efficacy both in vitro and in vivo    suggesting that membrane fusion facilitated lateral spread of also chemotherapeutics  which otherwise would not have occurred in a compact tumor 
The potential limitation of cell to cell dependent spread  however  may be that membrane free physical barriers  such as the ECM  may still pose a barrier to spread 
Also  it is unclear whether MFGs or other mechanisms of lateral spread may assist in reaching distant tumor nests Some other strategies to alleviate matrix imposed restrictions to oncolytic viruses have been discussed elsewhere   Tumors of epithelial origin mostly retain the firm cellular integrity seen in their original adhesive intercellular configuration 
Several viruses use cellular receptors which are located in paracellular tight junctions  which may be problematic in tightly packed tumors   
Adenovirus C group viruses use coxsackie adenovirus receptor  CAR  as their primary entry point  whereas adenovirus B  group members and measles virus Edmonston use CD  complement binding molecule as their cellular receptor   
Adenovirus B  group  serotypes       and   entry occurs using desmoglein   DSG    
Of these  CAR and DSG  are preferentially located within tight junctions and are hidden from virus binding   
Also the complement receptor CD  was ascribed a role in maintenance of epithelial cell integrity by interactions with the E cadherin catenin network   
These observations imply that before reaching the potential entry site on the tumor cell the virus must find its way into the junctional space 
Moreover  it has become increasingly clear that for example glioma tumors traditionally targeted by Ad  serotype adenoviruses often express only low levels of CAR and instead much higher levels of CD    Beyond that tight junctions hide multiple virus receptors  they contain a network of adhesion molecules  including ZO  cadherins  claudins and occludin  which  if perturbed  is associated with more aggressive disease in many types of cancer   
Since tight junctions also contain important receptors that mediate tumor promoting signaling and which have been targeted by monoclonal antibodies  notably Her  it would be highly useful to develop strategies that temporarily loosen the tight junction contacts even at cost of a transient increase in tumor metastatic risk 
One of the most interesting approaches has been to exploit the natural propensity of adenovirus serotype   which as part of its natural life cycle creates dodecahedral particles  PtDd  consisting of viral capsid proteins  penton base and fiber that open tight junctions by binding to and dissolving desmoglein  dimers and reducing E cadherin expression  to develop a specific tight junction opening molecule  JO    
Adenovirus type   uses PtDds to promote its own infection  opening the tight junctions ahead of infection to maximize access to desmoglein 
Analogously  when administered to human tumor xenografts  JO  facilitated penetration of trastuzumab much deeper into the tumor tissue than when the monoclonal antibody was administered on its own   
Moreover  JO  synergized with several chemotherapeutics in solid tumor models   
Backed by our own findings with oncolytic SFV  showing that both extracellular matrix and tumor cell compactness restrict virus spread and oncolytic efficacy  we believe combination approaches that target both tight junctions and extracellular matrix will prove effective in future virotherapy development  Figure  An alternative approach to increasing tumor penetration by oncolytic viruses is to alter tumor cell morphology and status 
Notably  cell death and in particular the type of cell death induced by virus has been shown to affect virus distribution within a tumor mass  in a study by Nagano et al  administration of apoptosis inducing paclitaxel before injecting oncolytic herpes simplex virus increased virus dissemination in the tumor  allowing its diffuse in  tunnels  created by shrinking dying tumor cells   Maintenance of physiological adherence is essential for proper ECM function and for retaining cellular integrity 
Therefore  a potential caveat of using ECM degrading proteolytic enzymes or tight junction openers is the risk of neoplastic cell detachment from the tumor ECM and increased risk of metastasis 
While ECM degradation or tight junction opening may operate innocuously  there is also a chance that loss of E cadherins via proteases or via non specific deregulation of tight junction integrity during ECM modulating therapy could trigger pro tumorigenic Wnt β catenin signaling  possibly driving epithelial to mesenchymal transition   
One study showed that ectopic relaxin expression stimulated MMP expression and enhanced breast cancer invasiveness    whereas another paper found short term relaxin exposure to increase breast cancer cell motility whereas long term expression reduced both motility and cancer invasiveness   
In the context of oncolytic viruses  Lavilla Alonso tested several proteases  including hyaluronidase  relaxin  and macrophage metalloelastase  and showed they all could assist adenovirus entry into tumors  yet  the authors did not detect treatment induced metastases or increase in tumor invasiveness   
Another strategy possibly balancing some of the putative risks of tight junction disruption could be to use Wnt dependent oncolytic viruses   Tumors are invariably fenestrated by host fibroblasts  myeloid cells and other non transformed cells  which driven by cancer induced cues can adopt various reprogrammed phenotypes to promote tumor angiogenesis and growth and to alter tumor responses to therapies   
As most of them normally play a role in immune homeostasis and pathogen sensing  they also respond to and influence oncolytic virus infection of tumors Fulci et al 
reported that injection of oncolytic HSV  directly into glioblastoma tumor parenchyma triggered upregulation of CD  and CD  monocytic markers and rapid clearance of virus  likely executed by infiltrating phagocytic cells   
When clodronate liposomes were used to deplete macrophages in vivo  the authors observed a  fold increase in virus titers in the brain tumors concomitant with an   reduction in peripheral CD  macrophages in animal spleens  suggesting that CD  cells migrate into the tumors upon virus injection and limit overall oncolytic efficacy 
While CD  cells were not reduced by peripheral macrophage depletion  arguing that these cells had been recruited to the tumors before the treatment  they could be eliminated in live glioma slices ex vivo  resulting in a  fold increase in virus replication 
Macrophages may secrete antiviral type I interferon constitutively at very low  subnanomolar  levels   and recently Liu et al 
showed that tumor resident CD  macrophages induced a protective antiviral state in ovarian and breast tumors which led to resistance to oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus  VSV  infection   
Type I IFN signaling  JAK  inhibitor Ruxolitinib reversed the resistance  facilitating VSV replication in the macrophage protected cancer cells 
It is tempting to speculate that tumor resident macrophages also rendered syngeneic GL  and DBT mouse gliomas completely refractory to VA  oncolytic alphavirus  as these cells were quite infectable in vitro and live glioma slices regained their sensitivity to virus within   h  indicating dilution of IFN I   Macrophages or the closely related myeloid suppressor cells are the predominant stromal cell type in many tumors and are actively recruited during cancer progression   
Heavy macrophage presence in the tumors indicates that such tumors may be resistant to oncolytic virotherapy  unless depleting preconditioning would be used 
Moreover  as part of the early immune response to virus infection  monocytic cells are rapidly recruited to tumors following intratumoral virus injection 
In one study  depletion of either CD b  cells or VEGF secreted by these cells in mice treated with oncolytic HSV  greatly increased oncolytic efficacy  tentatively linking pro tumorigenic and antiviral angiogenic mechanisms   Another key pro tumorigenic signaling employed by many tumors is up regulation of CXCR  the receptor for chemokine CXCL   also known as SDF  and recruitment of stromal cells expressing CXCL  which maintain the tumor and recruit additional cells to support tumor expansion and invasion  such as endothelial cell progenitors which contribute to neovascularization   
Indeed  high CXCR  expression is a negative prognostic factor for many cancers 
Oncolytic vaccinia virus engineered to express a soluble antagonist of CXCR  showed improved intratumoral virus replication  increased vascular disruption and a markedly reduced infiltration of the tumors by putative immune suppressive and tumor promoting stromal cells   
This study highlights how reducing pro tumor stromal cell effects may alleviate antiviral resistance and yield increased overall therapeutic efficacy 
On the other hand  if the paracrine antiviral effects of tumor homing monocytic cells could be selectively abrogated these cells could favorably be used to ferry oncolytic viruses into tumors 
Indeed  a significant delay in metastatic tumor potential was achieved when macrophages were harnessed to deliver a tumor specific oncolytic adenovirus   What is the antiviral status in human cancer 
Recent analyses from different normal cells that occupy the same organ reveal striking functional variation in components of the type I IFN signaling pathway that correlate with the tissue tropism and virulence of some virus strains   
Can similar variation in such components be found in cancer cells  or do cancer cells make an exception Transformed cells undergo selective elimination by the immune system before becoming cancerous  termed immunoediting  based on observations of differential capacity of immunocompetent mice to reject tumors previously grown in immunocompromised hosts versus syngeneic animals   
Cancer cell responsiveness to type I and type II IFNs plays a role during immunoediting  cancer cells that eventually progress to form a tumor display reduced capacity to respond to IFN gamma  which otherwise would upregulate MHC class I molecules and render the tumors amenable to CD  T cell mediated destruction  whereas responsiveness to type I interferon initially helps tumors avoid immune purging during the editing phase and is then irrelevant   
Of note  the anti tumor effects of type I IFN  still exploited today in several cancers  were shown to depend on host NK cells  and mice in which IFNAR was blocked by monoclonal antibody failed to reject even highly immunogenic tumors  as opposed to mice treated with control antibody  who all rejected the immunogenic tumor challenge   
Thus  whereas tumor responsiveness to type I IFN is not predetermined after immunoediting  other factors post immunoediting may influence it In several tumor types  varying levels of expression of components of the type I IFN signaling cascade have been detected  and in some tumor types these components have been found to have prognostic value  whereas in others they do not seem to influence survival   
However  emerging data suggests that antiviral genes may predict poor survival because they increase treatment resistance 
In one study  poor prognosis of several types of cancer due to genotoxic treatment resistance was found to correlate with increased activity of IFN I pathway genes   
In this study  a triad of type I IFN signaling pathway genes  STAT  ISG  and IFIT  formed a pan tumor type negative prognostic factor  and a broader seven gene cluster established negative prognostic criteria for treatment resistant breast cancer 
Treatment resistance was subsequently shown to depend on STAT  signaling  STAT expressing tumor clones were positively selected in animals in vivo  demonstrating increased proliferation and metastatic potential  and STAT expression mediated resistance against genotoxic assault by doxorubicin or ionizing radiation  knockdown of STAT  resulted in lower proliferation rate and metastatic capacity and increased sensitivity to genotoxic stress    
In another study  resistance to epigenetic DNA modifiers  AZA dC  a methyltransferase inhibitor  and LBH  or MGCD  both histone deacetylase  HDAC  inhibitors  was correlated with increased expression of IFN I pathway genes in small lung cancer cells   
Basal IFN related gene expression in several different SML cell lines was upregulated Interestingly  in many cancers  STAT proteins are not phosphorylated and persist in unphosphorylated form  U STAT 
Like its phosphorylated counterpart  U STAT  increases expression of genes contributing to resistance to DNA damaging agents   
While it is currently unknown why cancers may prefer to use unphosphorylated forms  it is known that U STATs activate distinct signals compared to their phosphorylated counterparts 
However  importantly for oncolytic viruses  in many tumors  constant expression and release of type I IFN leads to a constitutively high level of unphosphorylated forms of STAT  STAT  and IRF  which together form an unphosphorylated but functional ISGF like complex that relocalizes to the nucleus and drives expression of a specific set of ISGs distinct from acute IFN I exposure   
These ISGs are sufficient to maintain a functional antiviral defense and they play a critical role in resistance to DNA damaging agents On a cellular level  virus replication is controlled by antiviral defense molecules    which in turn are primarily controlled by type I IFN signaling 
In addition to classical type I IFN  or cytokine induced antiviral signaling  tumors may employ other antiviral defense mechanisms 
For example  stromal cells may secrete peptides with antiviral properties called defensins   
The defensins are amphiphatic and typically  –  amino acids in length and interfere with viruses by physically binding to and disrupting virus particles and or by inducing antiviral responses in target cells via pattern recognition receptors 
At least oral squamous cell carcinomas were found to overexpress defensins compared to normal control tissues   
While the role of defensins in oncolytic virus infection of tumors is unclear  one study showed that the immune stimulating properties of defensins may be exploited to increase overall therapeutic efficacy 
In this study  expression of beta   defensin from a conditionally replicating adenovirus yielded a superior therapeutic entity compared to the unarmed parental virus via enhanced anti tumor immune responses mediated by TLR dependent activation of dendritic cells   In summary  human cancers display varying degrees of expression of antiviral proteins or their signaling regulators at baseline 
Some of these may increase in response to genotoxic anti cancer treatments 
In the next chapter we will highlight some of the consequences to oncolytic virotherapy of the heterogeneity in type I IFN responsiveness in tumor cells All oncolytic viruses tested to date display variable infectivity in different cancer cell lines 
This variability is likely at least partly dependent on type I IFN as most oncolytic viruses are IFN sensitive 
IFN secretion follows virus sensing by the cells via Toll like receptors expressed on both the plasma membrane and in endocytotic vesicles  NOD like receptors  STING  AIM  NLP inflammosome and other danger sensing molecules  summarized elsewhere   
While all viruses carry an arsenal of counteracting molecules    no virus goes completely undetected 
Even HSV amplicons  which are devoid of functional virus genes  induce a type I IFN response that mediates a STAT dependent system wide antiviral defense in mice within one hour of intravenous vector injection  resulting in significant reduction of transgene expression compared to expression in STAT  knockout animals   During our own studies with attenuated SFV vector VA  it became apparent that the dramatic and lasting therapeutic efficacy achieved following mere single intravenous  or intratumoral  injection of the virus in immunocompromised mice bearing human A  melanoma or U  glioma xenografts   was not going to be recapitulated easily in immunocompetent animals   
The paradox in our studies was that while oncolytic SFV vector VA  effectively replicated in and destroyed a variety of IFN responsive cancer cell lines in vitro  it consistently failed to eradicate tumors generated from the same cell types in vivo  even if large doses of virus were injected directly into the tumor mass and even if the tumors were void of visible physical barriers  Figure  
Conversely  only tumors generated from IFN unresponsive cancer cells have seemed infectable in vivo by VA  so far 
In light of earlier findings by others  showing that type I IFN receptor knockout mice are highly susceptible to SFV infection and quickly succumb to multi organ systemic infection    the parameters for oncolytic SFV efficacy seem clear  tumor cells must be defective in type I IFN response for the virus to be effective These findings are in line with emerging data from other groups  showing a remarkably strict dependence of oncolytic virus replication on defective type I IFN responsiveness  a dogma introduced at the turn of the  st century   
For example  sarcomas and melanomas display differing permissiveness to oncolytic VSV  an obstacle which may be overcome by blocking type I IFN signaling   
In eight sarcoma cell lines  basal up regulation of RIG I and IFIT  and rapid induction of STAT  phosphorylation upon IFN I treatment correlated with resistance to oncolytic measles virus   
In other studies  human pancreatic and ovarian cancer cells display resistance against Rb dependent oncolytic adenovirus  strongly correlating with intracellular levels of MxA  and acquired resistance to repeated oncolytic adenovirus injections in an intraperitoneal ovarian carcinoma model was associated with an increase in MxA as well as several other key ISGs in the tumors   
A study comparing normal human or mouse melanocytes to a panel of melanoma cells revealed strong correlation between permissiveness to oncolytic VSV and capacity to mount antiviral defense in response to type I IFN   
In this study  VSV rp  harboring two mutations in P and L genes  was superior to several other tested oncolytic VSV strains  but the dependence on defective IFN responsiveness was still retained 
In yet another study  oncolytic VSV replicated in four out of twelve mesothelioma cell lines which were unable to mount antiviral defense upon IFN beta pretreatment or to respond to infection by up regulation of PKR  MxA or  OAS mRNA   
In contrast  the non permissive mesothelioma cells mounted antiviral defense  associated with PKR  MxA or  OAS mRNA up regulation  in response to infection or to exogenous type I IFN 
The authors of this study further linked the observed pattern of virus resistance to clinical mesothelioma samples  where in a mesothelioma tissue array  significant variance in immunoreactivity against PKR  p  and or IFNAR was observed  with only a few samples displaying lack of reactivity against all three components  arguing that most tumors in clinical settings would display at least some level of resistance to oncolytic VSV Oncolytic adenoviruses are often deleted for E A  which normally binds Rb and prevents it from sequestering E F  which results in the viruses being unable to replicate in normal cells 
However  since adenovirus  as with all viruses  contains elements that antagonize antiviral defenses  such elements have also been targets for deletion to render the virus sensitive to innate antiviral defenses  which would be expected to remain intact only in normal cells 
Cancer cells expressing Ras may down regulate protein kinase R and inhibit type I IFN induction by interfering with RIG I signaling   
Also  select interferon stimulated genes appear to be repressed by the Ras MEK ERK signaling cascade   
PKR activation shuts down E F dependent translation  including translation of virus messenger RNAs 
Therefore  an adenovirus deleted for VA RNA  which antagonizes PKR  should be capable of replicating in Ras overexpressing  tumor  cells 
However  while this was seemingly the case    it was later discovered that Ras is not an obligatory determinant for PKR inactivation and that virus replication was halted even in Ras overexpressing cells via functional PKR mediated E F phosphorylation  implying that the parameters of VA RNA deleted adenovirus replication had to be revised   
Similar findings were obtained with oncolytic reovirus  against which Ras independent tumor resistance emerged in vivo   
Thus  under some circumstances even tumor cells over expressing Ras may respond to type I IFN or to stimulants of pattern recognition receptors  activating PKR and inhibiting virus translation 
To complicate matters  MEK inhibitors have been shown restore antiviral signaling capacity in Ras overexpressing tumors   
This implies that human tumors treated with MEK inhibitors  such as Trametinib which was recently approved for treatment of BRAF mutated melanoma  may be poor targets for oncolytic viruses as antiviral signaling capacity in such tumors may be restored Some oncolytic viruses  such as members of the poxvirus family  are seemingly resistant to the antiviral effects of type I IFNs in vitro and may be controlled by other cellular factors   
However  in most cases  sensitivity or resistance to type I IFN is assessed in vitro and using only one cytokine  which may mask synergies with other factors present in vivo 
One possible explanation for the in vitro–in vivo discrepancy is the tumor micro environment  which not only imposes physical barriers to oncolytic viruses but also alters intracellular antiviral defenses 
For example  glioma cells were found in the brain to spontaneously secrete type I IFN  which conferred resistance against oncolytic HSV 
Resistance was linked to ECM protein CCN  interaction with glioma cell surface receptor alpha   beta   integrin  which activated interferon secretion   
It is tempting to speculate whether this or a similar ECM glioma interaction could have contributed to the resistance of syngeneic glioma cells we observed in vivo but not in vitro to both oncolytic SFV and vaccinia virus  FIG    
Also  while critical in many respects  antiviral signaling may occur without signaling via type I IFN receptor  IFNAR 
For instance  upon infection of IFNAR KO mice with murine hepatitis virus  MHV  brain cells were found to have upregulated antiviral GTPase TGTP and IFITm  and IFITm  all of which have confirmed antiviral activity in vivo against a variety of viruses   
In these cases  IFN gamma and TNF alpha likely account for at least part of the observed ISG activity  where e g  TGTP is upregulated by IFN γ signaling and TNFα has been shown to induce ISG  independently of IFNAR   Interestingly  while most cancers are heterogeneous in antiviral defence signaling  one broad class of tumors in particular may display consistently low capacity to ward off oncolytic viruses  oncovirus induced cancers 
This is because oncoviruses  as all viruses  carry a complement of factors that abrogate antiviral sensors and effectors  which may result in tumors that are uniformly devoid of antiviral signaling 
In an intriguing study  oncolytic VSV infected and destroyed human papilloma virus  HPV positive cervical carcinoma cells more effectively than HPV negative head  and neck cancer cells due to HPV E mediated suppression of antiviral signaling   
HPV positive or E expressing xenografts were efficiently eradicated from nude mice following VSV injection 
The potential of this approach is that even oncolytic viruses that are extremely sensitive to type I IFN  such as attenuated SFV or M mutated VSV  may function well against oncovirus induced cancers where the oncovirus machinery ensures the lack of antiviral defense While on first thought it would appear counterintuitive to antagonize the very factors that keep oncolytic viruses tumor specific  emerging data shows that this can be accomplished in a safe way 
One of the foremost strategies to increase oncolytic virus efficacy is to combine them with drugs that lower tumor antiviral defenses 
In this regard  a primary target for interference is the prototypical type I IFN signaling cascade 
While small molecular inhibitors against IFNAR are not available  activity of downstream signaling transducers may effectively be blocked 
Human pancreatic cancer cells were shown to constitutively express high levels of MxA and OAS and to mount type I IFN dependent resistance to oncolytic VSV 
Resistance could be overcome by blocking activity of IFNAR associated Janus kinase  JAK      
Similarly  JAK  inhibitor ruxolitinib overcame type I IFN dependent resistance of human SCC  head and neck cancer cells against oncolytic VSV   
Ruxolitinib also successfully abrogated type I IFN mediated antiviral effects elicited by macrophages    highlighting that this drug might also alleviate type I IFN dependent tumor resistance to oncolytic viruses imposed by stromal cells 
However  the obvious downside to using JAK inhibitors is their effects on critical host defense mechanisms  which may result in increased infection of normal cells 
Moreover  JAK inhibitors may reduce anti tumor immune responses elicited by oncolytic virotherapy 
For example  ruxolitinib was shown to impair the capacity of dendritic cells promote CD  T cell responses against model tumor antigens   
On the other hand  in this study clearance of adenovirus was delayed in ruxolitinib treated normal animals  which makes it difficult to predict the overall impact of JAK inhibitors on tumor therapy where prolonged virus presence might translate to better therapeutic efficacy 
Also  while the immune stimulating and anti tumor effects of type I and type II interferons may be adversely affected by JAK inhibitors  central tumor promoting cascades mediated by JAKs  such as IL STAT  may also be inhibited    yielding a difficult to predict net therapeutic outcome 
At the moment  more studies are needed to establish the overall impact of interference with JAK  signaling in cancer therapy Spurred by earlier reports of oncovirus reactivation and promoter enhancement by histone deacetylase  HDAC  inhibitors  this class of agents was assessed for capacity to enhance oncolytic virus potency by inhibiting antiviral responses 
Indeed  such enhancement was observed with oncolytic VSV and SFV  and while it has been difficult to pinpoint the exact mechanisms that underlie HDAC inhibitor enhancement of oncolytic virus replication in cancer cells  antiviral defenses in general are inhibited for yet unknown reasons mainly in cancer cells and not in normal cells  which indirectly facilitates virus replication   
Interestingly  combination of HDAC inhibitors with conditionally replicating   E A deleted adenovirus gave improved virus replication rate and therapeutic efficacy in subcutaneous xenograft models only when the inhibitors were given before the virus  otherwise inhibition of replication was observed   
Similarly  HDAC inhibitors increased replication and oncolytic efficacy of HSV when given before the virus but not when given at the same time   
With nuclear DNA viruses  such as adenovirus and HSV  it is possible that HDAC inhibitors also alter virus genome accessibility to transcription factors  resulting in reduced replication or other adverse effects  implying that with these viruses HDAC inhibitors should be administered before the viruses Recently  it was found that HDAC inhibitor vorinostat activates NfκB signaling by facilitating hyperacetylation of the p  subunit  which in turn activates cellular autophagy   
Autophagy was in another study shown to be important for VSV replication  presumably by inhibiting antiviral signaling 
This is interesting  as a previous study revealed enhancement of VSV replication by inhibiting TNF alpha induced antiviral signaling mediated by p  using NfκB inhibitors BMS  or TPCA    
In this study  neither inhibitor had an effect on STAT  or STAT  phosphorylation or their nuclear relocalization in response to type I IFN but the authors observed clear induction of ISG  GBP  and MX  in response to type I IFN in U  glioma cells  with the latter two being dependent on NfκB signaling 
Taken together  NfκB pathway activation may result in different antiviral responses in different cancer types  and inhibition or enhancement of oncolytic viruses by NfκB inhibitors is dependent on other concomitant cellular mechanisms  such as autophagy Since HDAC inhibitors modulate promoter activity accessibility  it is conceivable other epigenetic or promoter modifying agents could work in a similar manner to repress antiviral defense induction and enhance oncolytic viruses   
DNA demethylating agents  azacytidine  Aza  and decitabine synergized with oncolytic herpes simplex type   virus in glioma models in vitro and in vivo  as did HDAC inhibitor valproic acid  VPA  which was already shown before to work well with oncolytic HSV as well as several other oncolytic viruses   
Moreover  inhibition of cancer antiviral defenses  specifically RNAseL and PKR  resulted when cancer cells were exposed to sunitinib  a multi tyrosine kinase inhibitor originally developed as an inhibitor of VEGF R and PDGF R signaling  yielding strong anti tumor synergy with IFN sensitive oncolytic VSV   
Since sunitinib is approved for renal cell carcinoma and imatinib resistant gastric cancers  combination with oncolytic VSV constitutes a promising and clinically relevant approach warranting further investigation 
Interstingly  sunitinib as well as several other receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors displayed antiviral effects against polyomavirus BK    arguing that these compounds are not universal virus enhancers Cyclophosphamide  CPA  is a general immunosuppressant used to minimize Treg presence during immunotherapy and also oncolytic virotherapy 
CPA may  however  also enhance replication and efficacy of oncolytic viruses by diminishing cytokine secretion by stromal cells  including type I IFN   
Another compound enhancing oncolytic virus efficacy by lowering cell responsiveness to type I IFN is triptolide  which acts downstream of IRF  activation   
Further  the kinase mammalian target of rapamycin  mTOR  enhances the antiviral effects of type I IFN by activation of its effector proteins  E BP  which binds and inactivates translation factor eIF E  and S K  which carries out cell type specific signaling functions of type I IFN  such as activation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor  B and promotion of ISG  transcription 
Consequently  rapamycin was able to enhance oncolytic VSV replication and anti tumor efficacy by inhibiting type I IFN mediated antiviral signaling via mTOR   Several other compounds synergizing with oncolytic viruses have been identified via high throughput drug library screening  many of which seem to act by antagonizing antiviral defenses 
For instance  a novel virus sensitizer  Vse  was found to greatly diminish antiviral effects of type I IFN against oncolytic VSV in several cancer cell types  and the drug also synergized with the virus in subcutaneous mouse tumor models   
For many of these new compounds  the mechanism of action is still poorly understood  necessitating extensive safety studies to exclude undesirable effects against normal cells Apart from classical type I IFN induced antiviral defenses  which typically prevent virus translation and degrade virus genomes  other cellular machineries regulate oncolytic virus efficacy 
Notably  strategies to increase cancer cell death in response to oncolytic viruses have been tested 
In a recent study  a class of compounds called SMAC mimetics synergized in several cancer models with oncolytic VSV by removing cancer cell block to apoptosis in response to virus induced type I IFN  TNF α or TRAIL   
Interestingly  since virus infection triggered cytokines act on nearby non infected cells  SMAC mimetics may in combination with oncolytic viruses also cause significant bystander tumor destruction 
Normal cells are not affected by the IFN SMAC mimetic synergy  providing an important safety aspect 
In another study  blocking the ER stress response circuitry triggered by oncolytic rhabdovirus infection by a small molecular inhibitor of serine threonine protein kinase and endoribonuclease IRE α  which was identified in a genome wide siRNA screen  greatly enhanced cytotoxicity via caspase induced apoptosis and increased oncolytic efficacy in refractory tumor models in mice   
This effect was independent on induction or responsiveness to type I IFN 
Conversely  inhibitors of nucleoside transporter   ENT  were discovered from a high throughput screen of enhancers of oncolytic HSV  and to date such inhibitors have not been reported to alter cellular antiviral responses   
Other compounds  such as common chemotherapeutics  and their mechanisms synergizing with oncolytic viruses have been discussed elsewhere for most of them the possible role of antiviral defense antagonism in enhancing oncolytic virus efficacy remains to be studied   Thus  many compounds are available to interfere with tumor antiviral defenses 
The outstanding question for most of them  however  seems to be why such compounds do not render normal cells sensitive to oncolytic viruses 
Elucidation of the exact mechanisms of action and the differences between normal and cancer cells constitute a worthy goal for studies in the near future Already in the  s it became clear that using certain pathogenic wildtype viruses  such as West Nile virus and Bunyamwera virus  in cancer patients would result in off target toxicity   
Characteristic for pathogenic viruses is a greater ability to circumvent or antagonize cellular innate antiviral defenses than attenuated strains 
For example  unlike the prototypical oncolytic reovirus strain type   Dearing  the T L strain of reovirus causes accumulation of IRF  in the nucleus and inhibits activation of a select group of ISGs yet because of this property the T L strain is myocarditic unlike the oncolytic type   Dearing strain   
For these reasons  many oncolytic viruses used today  such as reovirus type   Dearing  oncolytic strains of Newcastle disease virus and M mutated VSV have either a stronger capacity to induce or a weaker capacity to resist antiviral type I IFN than the corresponding wildtype strains   An open question  however  is whether strain specific or virus specific differences that relate to specific components of the cellular antiviral machinery may be exploited for greater anti tumor efficacy  i e  if one virus fails  could another be used in its stead 
While Ras expression was critical for oncolytic reovirus replication in cells overexpressing CUG  oncogene  oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus was unable to replicate in the same cells due to increased activation of STAT  and OASL    
Thus  in these cells reovirus was not affected by STAT  or OASL  and it therefore remains interesting to see which other antiviral effectors may have been lacking in the CUG expressing cells and  conversely  how reovirus and VSV differ in terms of sensitivity to antiviral effectors 
While several oncolytic viruses have been compared to each other in terms of replication rate and cytotoxicity  systematic studies with regard to tumor antiviral defenses have not been conducted As any attenuated virus is likely to replicate effectively only in its own niche  i e  to be restricted by a specific set of ISGs  and as wild type strains may be too toxic for use in humans  a compromise may be achieved by incorporating select elements from wild type viruses into oncolytic virus backbones 
Indeed  several chimeric and recombinant viruses have been generated that harbor specific elements of wild type strains or even of other unrelated viruses in order to better resist cancer antiviral defenses  Table  
As an example of introducing wild type elements into attenuated viruses  Haralambieva reported on a measles virus Edmonston vaccine strain in which P gene was replaced with the counterpart from the wild type IC B strain   
Later  Meng et al 
included N  P  and L genes from wild type measles in Edmonston backbone  producing an enhanced but still safe oncolytic virus   
Edmonston vaccine virus induces a more robust IFN response compared to wild type measles virus partly due to the weaker ability of V protein to suppress MDA mediated activation of IRF  and IFN I induction   
In vivo  P gene encoded proteins  particularly V  control the quality of the cytokine response to measles so that vaccine strains qualitatively induce a stronger inflammatory response compared to WT strains  where WT V protein suppresses multiple cytokine secretion 
V protein short cytoplasmic tail has been shown to bind and inactivate STAT  IRF  MDA  and the Rel homology domain of the NfκB subunit p  but not of p    
Also  V causes LGP  protein to bind and inactivate RIG I    but it seemingly does not interfere with TICAM   TRIF  multiple TLR adaptor  including TLR mediated IFN β induction 
Thus  if cancer and normal cells would differ with regard to TICAM  or IRF  then such a virus could potentially target specifically cancer cells rather than normal cells 
So far  the measles Edmonston WT chimeras have proven safe in animals As an example of heterologous virus constructs  lentogenic Newcastle disease virus engineered to express influenza virus PR   H N  NS  showed enhanced oncolytic efficacy in vivo due to dampening of antiviral responses   
While such a virus did not display enhanced pathogenicity in that study  a mesogenic NDV virus harboring NS  from influenza strain H N  did show increased pathogenicity in chickens as well as an increased ability to replicate in human cells    raising some cautionary warnings for future engineering of similar replicative viruses 
As another example  vaccinia virus soluble type I IFN scavenger B R  NOTE  B R is often used in the literature  has been engineered into both oncolytic HSV and oncolytic rhabdoviruses  resulting in all cases in more effective therapy agents without loss of tumor specificity   
Oncolytic γ  gene deleted HSV was complemented by two different PKR antagonists from human cytomegalovirus  TRS  and IRS  generating a chimera capable of reaching wild type virus replication levels in cancer cells in vitro and in tumor models in vivo   The selection of various viral IFN I antagonists that potentially could be used to augment attenuated oncolytic viruses is vast   
For example  increased replication of several viruses  including HIV  Sindbis virus and E deleted adenovirus in mammalian cells was observed when the cells were engineered to express vaccinia virus E L protein  influenza A virus NS  protein  ebola virus VP  protein or HIV  Tat protein   
The choice of antagonist must primarily be made with safety in mind  but virus specific and cell specific differences in antagonist functions may potentially be exploited rationally when considering the overall combination 
For example  vaccinia virus E L is able to rescue VSV but not EMCV from exogenous IFN  whereas vaccinia virus K L partially rescued EMCV but not VSV   In anticipation of systematic  perhaps bioinformatically guided   super chimera  studies  two or more viruses that may complement each other s shortcomings in antiviral defense antagonism have been considered 
Notably  vaccinia virus was favorably combined with IFN I sensitive oncolytic VSV and SFV  yielding tumor model dependent increases in overall therapy efficacy that were dependent on vaccinia virus antagonism of type I IFN responses  which increased the replication of the IFN sensitive viruses   
Such heterologous virotherapy approaches may also be used to generate immunological synergy  similar to heterologous prime boost vaccination  anti tumor immune responses may be increased due to targeting of the tumor by two different viruses  on two separate occasions  but anti virus immune responses would be generated against different viruses each time  avoiding the problem of neutralizing immunity to and predominance of antivirus immune responses   
Some other ideas explored experimentally include engineering oncolytic viruses to express other oncolytic viruses 
For example  the entire oncolytic parvovirus H  genome was placed under a regulatable promoter in oncolytic adenovirus  resulting in a more effective therapeutic entity than either virus alone without loss of tumor specificity   
The genetic material of Semliki Forest virus replicons has been engineered into adenovirus and vaccinia virus backbones   and several other virus chimeras have been constructed   
However  the effects on tumor antiviral defenses of such a constructs remain to be studied The attribute  oncolytic  implies for a virus that it infects and  indeed  lyses the infected tumor 
This property is primarily tested in vitro in cultured tumor cells 
We have learned  however  that in the native tumor microenvironment in living hosts many viruses are no longer able to infect tumor cells or to kill them even if they manage to infect them 
Tightly packed tumor cells and the network of supportive molecules of the extracellular matrix form a physical barrier to virus particle diffusion 
It has also become evident that the tumor cells themselves may be much more capable of thwarting oncolytic virus advances than previously thought  with some tumor cells residing in a seemingly permanent non permissive antiviral state 
Tumors harbor multiple cell types in addition to the neoplastic cells  which may promote and propagate both physical and cellular virus resistance 
As the efficacy of virotherapy in human cancer patients still falls shy of the achievements in animal models  it appears quite plausible that one or more of the barriers described in this review indeed constitute a real and formidable obstacle for oncolytic virus advancement into routine clinical use 
Fortunately  some of the most difficult barriers have been identified  and a rapidly expanding arsenal of countermeasures is at our disposal 
Our task is now to separate the wheat from the chaff and to systematically evaluate the proposed combination regimens that will yield the best results without compromising patient safety Recombination Every Day  Abundant Recombination in a Virus during a Single Multi Cellular Host InfectionAs increasing numbers of full length viral sequences become available  recombinant or mosaic viruses are being recognized more frequently   
Recombination events have been demonstrated to be associated with viruses expanding their host range   or increasing their virulence    thus accompanying  or perhaps even being at the origin of  major changes during virus adaptation 
It remains unclear  however  whether recombination events represent a highly frequent and significant phenomenon in the everyday life of these viruses Viruses can exchange genetic material when at least two different viral genomes co infect the same host cell 
Progeny can then become hybrid through different mechanisms  such as reassortment of segments when the parental genomes are fragmented    intra molecular recombination when polymerases switch templates  in RNA viruses     or homologous or non homologous recombination  in both RNA and DNA viruses 
Quantification of viral recombination in multi cellular organisms has been attempted under two distinct experimental approaches  in vitro  in cell cultures     and in vivo  in live hosts    
The in vitro approach  which has so far been applied only to animal viruses  allows the establishment of the  intrinsic  recombination rate in experimentally co infected cells in cell cultures   
However  it does not necessarily reflect the situation in entire  living hosts  where the frequency of co infected cells is poorly known and depends on many factors such as the size of the pathogen population  the relative frequency and distribution of the different variants  and host defense mechanisms preventing secondary infection of cells 
The in vivo experimental approach is closer to biological conditions and may thus be more informative of what actually happens in  the real world However  as discussed below  numerous experimental constraints have so far precluded an actual quantification of the baseline rate of recombination 
First  many experimental designs have used extreme positive selection  where only recombinant genomes were viable  e g    
Other studies did not use complementation techniques but detected recombinants by PCR within infected hosts or tissues    which provides information on their presence but not on their frequency in the viral population 
So far  no quantitative PCR or other quantitative method has been applied to evaluate the number of recombinants appearing in an experimentally infected live host 
Finally  recent methods based on sequence analysis inferred the population recombination rate  rather than the individual recombination rate   
While results from these methods certainly take in vivo recombination into account  there are other caveats  isolates have often been collected in different hosts sometimes in different geographical regions and sometimes the selective neutrality of sequence variation on which these estimates are based is not clearly established 
Estimates from such studies by essence address the estimation of the recombination rate at a different evolutionary scale Taken together  the currently available information indicates that no viral recombination rate has ever been estimated directly at time and space scales corresponding to a single multi cellular host infection  although this level is most significant for the biology and evolution of viruses 
This study intends to fill this gap by evaluating the recombination frequency of the cauliflower mosaic virus  CaMV  during a single passage in one of its host plants  the turnip Brassica rapa CaMV is a pararetrovirus  which is a major grouping containing hepadnaviruses  e g  hepatitis B virus  badnaviruses  e g  banana streak virus  and caulimoviruses  e g  CaMV 
Pararetroviruses are characterized by a non segmented double stranded DNA genome 
After entering the host cell nucleus  the viral DNA accumulates as a minichromosome   whose transcription is ensured by the host RNA polymerase II   
The CaMV genome consists in approximately   bp and encodes six viral gene products that have been detected in planta  Figure     
Viral proteins P  to P  are expressed from two major transcripts  namely a  S RNA  encoding P  and a  S RNA corresponding to the entire genome and serving as mRNA for proteins P –P    
Using the pre genomic  S RNA as a matrix  the protein P   product of gene V  reverse transcribes the genome into genomic DNA that is concomitantly encapsidated   The detection of CaMV recombinants in turnip hosts has been reported numerous times 
Some studies have demonstrated the appearance of infectious recombinant viral genomes after inoculation  i  of a host plant with two infectious or non infectious parental clones   or  ii  of a transgenic plant containing one CaMV transgene with a CaMV genome missing the corresponding genomic region   
While the former revealed inter genomic viral recombination  the latter demonstrated that CaMV can also recombine with transgenes within the host s genome 
Another study based on phylogenetic analyses of various CaMV strains has clearly suggested different origins for different genomic regions and  hence  multiple recombination events during the evolution of this virus   
Indirect experimental evidence has indicated that  in some cases  CaMV recombination could occur within the host nucleus  between different viral minichromosomes  presumably through the action of the DNA repair cellular machinery   
Nevertheless  the mechanism of  template switching  during reverse transcription  predominant in all retroviruses  most certainly also applies to pararetroviruses 
For this reason  and on the basis of numerous experimental data  CaMV is generally believed to recombine mostly in the cytoplasm of the host cell  by  legal  template switching between two pre genomic RNA molecules    or  illegal  template switching between the  S and the  S RNA   
Under this hypothesis  recombination in CaMV could therefore be considered as operating on a linear template during reverse transcription  with the  ′ and  ′ extremities later ligated to circularize the genomic DNA  position   in Figure  
The above cited studies clearly demonstrate that CaMV is able to recombine 
However  since these studies are based on complementation techniques  non quantitative detection  or phylogenetically based inferences of recombination  they do not inform us on whether recombination is an exceptional event or an  everyday  process shaping the genetic composition of CaMV populations In the present work  we aimed at answering this question 
To this end  we have constructed a CaMV genome with four genetic markers  demonstrated to be neutral in competition experiments 
By co inoculating host plants with equal amounts of wild type and marker containing CaMV particles  we have generated mixed populations in which impressive proportions of recombinants distributed in several different classes corresponding to exchange of different genomic regions have been detected and quantified 
Altogether  the recombinant genomes averaged over   of the population 
Further analysis of these data  assuming a number of viral replications during the infection period ranging from five to   indicates that the per nucleotide per replication cycle recombination rate of CaMV is of the same order of magnitude  i e  on the order of a few   across the entire genome 
We thereby provide the first quantification  to our knowledge  of the recombination rate in a virus population during a single passage in a single host From Figure   and supposing that all marker containing genomic regions can recombine  we could predict the detection and quantification of seven classes of recombinant genotypes   bcd a  a cd b  ab d c  abc d   cd ab  a d bc  and a c b d 
Indeed  all classes were detected  and their frequencies in the ten CaMV populations analyzed are summarized in Table  Altogether  the proportion of recombinant genomes found in the mixed viral populations was astonishingly high and very similar in the ten co infected plants analyzed  Table   last column  ranging between    plant   to    plants     and   with a mean frequency   standard error  of      
This result indicates that recombination events are very frequent during the invasion of the host plant by CaMV and represents  to our knowledge  the first direct quantification of viral recombination during the infection of a live multi cellular host The inferred per generation recombination and interference rates  assuming that CaMV undergoes ten replication cycles during the   d between infection and sampling  are given for each of the ten plants in Table  
Recombination rates between adjacent markers are large  on the order of   to  
Taking the distance in nucleotides between markers into account yields an average recombination rate per nucleotide and generation on the order of      
Interestingly  this recombination rate does not vary throughout the genome  Kruskal–Wallis test  p    To relax the assumption of the number of replications during the   d  we calculated the recombination parameters assuming five or   generations 
The effect of the number of generations on the estimates is linear  doubling the number of generations results in a halving of the recombination rate  detailed results not shown 
For example  the average recombination rates r

  assuming   generations were equal to     and   respectively  compare with values in Table   yielding per nucleotide per generation recombination rates of             and      Inspection of Table   also shows that first order interference coefficients were in general negative  indicating that a crossing over in one genomic segment increases the probability that a crossing over will occur in another genomic segment  while the second order coefficient parameter had an average value close to zero with a large variance 
The mechanism leading to these results will be discussed in the following section One major breakthrough in the work presented here lies in the space and time scales at which the experiments were performed 
Indeed  the processes occurring within the course of a single infection of one multi cellular host are of obvious biological relevance for any disease 
Previous studies on viral recombination suffered from major drawbacks in this respect  basing their conclusions on experiments relying on complementation among non infectious viruses or between viruses with undetermined relative fitness  on phylogenetically based analyses  or on experiments in cell cultures 
For reasons detailed in the Introduction  the first two methods either do not provide information on the frequency of recombination  but only its occurrence  or address the question at a different temporal  and often spatial  scale 
Results from cell cultures  on the other hand  impose cell co infection by different viral variants  potentially overestimating the frequency of recombination events 
Our study circumvents these limitations by analyzing viral genotypes sampled from infected plants after the course of a single infection  and therefore the invasion and co infection of cells in various organs and tissues is very close to natural More than half of the genomes       see Table   present in a CaMV population after a single passage in its host plant were identified as recombinants  and these data allowed us to infer a per nucleotide per generation recombination rate on the order of       to      
The time length of one generation  i e  the time required for a given genome to go from one replication to the next  is totally unknown in plant viruses 
The only experimental data available on CaMV are based on the kinetics of gene expression in infected protoplasts  where the capsid protein is produced between   and   h   
The reverse transcription and the encapsidation of genomic DNA being two coupled phenomena    we judged it reasonable to assume a generation time of   d and  thus  an average of ten generations during our experiments 
In case this estimate is mistaken  we have verified a linear relationship between r and the number of generations  thereby allowing an immediate adjustment of r if the CaMV generation time is more precisely established 
At this point  we must consider that all cloned genomes may not have been through all the successive replication events potentially allowed by the timing of our experiments 
It was previously shown that about   of CaMV mature virus particles accumulate in compact inclusion bodies    where they may be sequestered for a long time  as such inclusions are very frequent in all infected cells  including those in leaves that have been invaded by the virus population for several weeks 
The viral population may thus present an age structure that could bias the estimation of the recombination rate 
In order to minimize this bias  the clones we analyzed were collected in one young newly formed leaf  where the chances of finding genomes from  unsequestered lines  were assumed to be higher 
In any case  our data analysis is conservative  since this age structure can only lead to an underestimation of the recombination rate Our results show that interferences between pairs of loci are negative  a recombination event between two loci apparently increases the probability of recombination between another pair of loci 
We believe that the most parsimonious explanation of these negative interferences is based on the way the infection builds up within plant hosts 
Indeed  one can divide infected host cells into those infected by a single virus genotype and those infected by more than one viral genotype 
In the former  analogous to clonal propagation  recombination is undetectable 
In the latter  recombination is not only detectable but  as our results indicate  very frequent 
Samples consisting of viruses resulting from a mixture of these two types of host cell infections will thus contain viruses with no recombination and viruses with several recombination events  thus yielding an impression of negative interference 
These conceptual arguments are supported by mathematical models 
It is indeed easy to show  detailed results not shown  that if a proportion F of the population reproduces clonally  analogous to single infections  while the remaining reproduces panmictically  negative interferences could be inferred even if they do not exist 
For example  assuming a three locus model with real recombination rates r
  and r
  and interference i
  the  apparent  recombination and interference parameters  would be r
        F r  r
        F r
  and i
     F   i
    F 
Interestingly  this example also shows that our estimates of the recombination rate are conservative  that a fraction F of host cells are singly infected while others are multiply infected leads to an underestimation of the recombination rate As judged by r
  r
  and r
  calculated between markers a–b  b–c  and c–d  respectively  we found evidence for recombination through the entire CaMV genome 
The values for r
 
r
  and r
  are remarkably similar  hence the recombination sites seem to be evenly distributed along the genome 
We considered the template switching model as the major way recombinants are created in CaMV 
As already mentioned in the Introduction  hot spots of template switching have been predicted at the position of the  ′ extremities of the  S and  S RNAs   
If other recombination mechanisms  such as that associated with second strand DNA synthesis or with the host cell DNA repair machinery  act significantly  hot spots would be expected at the positions of the sequence interruption     and     
Due to the design of our experiment and the position of the four markers  we have no information on putative hot spots at positions corresponding to the  ′ end of the  S RNA and to    at nucleotide position  
Nevertheless  the putative hot spots at the  ′ end of the  S RNA and at   and    nucleotide positions   and   respectively  fall between marker pairs c–d  b–c  and a–b  respectively 
Our results indicate that either these hot spots are quantitatively equivalent though predicted by different recombination mechanisms or  more likely  that they simply do not exist 
Whatever the explanation  what we observe is that the CaMV can exchange any portion of its genome  and thus any gene thereof  with an astonishingly high frequency during the course of a single host infection To our knowledge  the viral recombination rate has never previously been quantified experimentally for a plant virus   
In contrast  retroviruses and particularly HIV  have been extensively investigated in that sense 
As we have already discussed for these latter cases  the quantification of the intrinsic recombination rate was carried out in artificially co infected cell cultures 
The estimated intrinsic per nucleotide per generation recombination rate in HIV  is on the order of      less than one order of magnitude higher than our estimation for CaMV 
Because for various reasons detailed above we probably underestimate the within host CaMV recombination rate  we believe that the intrinsic recombination rate in CaMV is higher and perhaps on the order of that of HIV Other pararetroviruses such as plant badnaviruses or vertebrate hepadnaviruses have a similar cycle within their host cells  including steps of nuclear minichromosome  genomic size RNA synthesis  and reverse transcription and encapsidation 
Nevertheless  vertebrate hepadnaviruses  e g  hepatitis B virus  infect hosts that are very different from plants in their biology and physiology  and this could lead to a totally different frequency of cell co infection during the development of the virus populations 
Thus  even though our results can be informative for other pararetroviruses because of the viruses  shared biological characteristics  they should not be extrapolated to vertebrate pararetroviruses without caution We used the plasmid pCa  which is the complete genome of the CaMV isolate Cabb S  cloned into the pBR  plasmid at the unique SalI restriction site   
To analyze recombination in different regions of the genome  we introduced four genetic markers  a  b  c  and d  at the positions       and   respectively  thus approximately at four cardinal points of the CaMV circular double stranded DNA of   bp  Figure  
All markers  each corresponding to a single nucleotide change  were introduced by PCR directed mutagenesis in pCa  and resulted in the duplication of previously unique restriction sites BsiWI  PstI  MluI  and SacI in a plasmid designated pMark S  Because  in this study  we targeted the possible exchange of genes between viral genomes  all markers a  b  c  and d were introduced within coding regions corresponding to open reading frames I  IV  V  and VI  respectively 
Another important concern was to quantify recombination in the absence of selection  i e  to create neutral markers 
Consequently all markers consist of synonymous mutations  see below To generate the parental virus particles  plasmids pCa  and pMark S were mechanically inoculated into individual plants as previously described   
All plants were turnips  B  rapa cv   Just Right  grown under glasshouse conditions at   °C with a    light dark  photoperiod 
Thirty days post inoculation  all symptomatic leaves were harvested and viral particles were purified as described earlier   The resulting preparations of parental viruses  designated Cabb S and Mark S  were quantified by spectrometry using the formula described by Hull et al 
  
We fixed the initial frequency of markers to a value of   and a solution containing   mg ml of virus particles of both Cabb S and Mark S at a   ratio was prepared 
Plantlets were co infected by mechanical inoculation of two to three leaves with   μl of this virus solution  using abrasive Celite AFA  Fluka  Ronkonkoma  New York  United States 
The mixed CaMV population was allowed to grow during   d of systemic infection We designed an experimental protocol for quantifying marker frequency within a mixed Cabb S Mark S virus population after a single passage in a host plant 
Twenty four individual plants  inoculated as above with equal amounts of Cabb S and Mark S  were harvested   d post inoculation  when symptoms were fully developed 
The viral DNA was purified from   mg of young newly formed infected leaves according to the protocol described previously   
After the precipitation step of this protocol  the viral DNA was resuspended and further purified with the Wizard DNA clean up kit  Promega  Fitchburg  Wisconsin  United States  in TE  X   mM Tris HCl and   mM EDTA  pH   
Aliquots of viral DNA preparations were digested by restriction enzymes corresponding either to marker a  b  c  or d and submitted to a   agarose gel electrophoresis  colored by ethydium bromide and exposed to UV 
Each individual restriction enzyme cut once in Cabb S DNA and twice in Mark S  thus generating DNA fragments of different sizes attributable to one or the other in the mixed population of CaMV genomes 
After scanning the agarose gels  we estimated the relative frequency of the two genotypes in each viral DNA preparation and at each marker position  by densitometry using the NIH   Image program 
The statistical analyses of the frequency of the four markers are described below To identify and quantify the recombinants within the CaMV mixed populations  aliquots from ten of the   viral DNA preparations described above were digested by the restriction enzyme SalI  and directly cloned into pUC  at the corresponding site 
In each of the ten viral populations analyzed    full genome length clones were digested separately by BsiWI  PstI  MluI  and SacI  to test for the presence of marker a  b  c  and d  respectively 
In this experiment  with the marker representing an additional restriction site  we could easily distinguish between the Cabb S and the Mark S genotype at all four marker positions  upon agarose gel   electrophoresis of the digested clones 
Clones with none or all four markers were parental genotypes  whereas clones harboring     or   markers were clearly recombinants 
Due to the very high number of recombinants detected  markers eventually appearing or disappearing due to spontaneous mutations were neglected Here we present the different methods we used to quantify recombination in the CaMV genome 
Because all these methods assume that the different markers are neutral  we first discuss assumption We used two datasets to test the neutrality of markers  both resulting from plants co infected with a   ratio of Mark S and Cabb S 
The first consisted of viral DNA densitometry data derived from   plants  described above  where for each plant we have an estimate of the frequency of each marker in the genome population 
The second consisted of the restriction of   individual full genome length viral clones obtained from one co infected plant  described above  yielding an estimate of the frequency of each marker  and this was repeated on ten different plants 
The frequencies of the different markers were       and   for markers a  b  c  and d in the first dataset and       and   in the second dataset 
We tested whether these frequencies were significantly different from the expected value under neutrality    using either t tests  for datasets where normality could not be rejected  seven out of eight cases  or Wilcoxon signed rank non parametric tests otherwise  marker c in the first dataset 
In all cases p values were larger than  There are several cautionary remarks regarding these analyses 
First  in all cases we found an excess of markers 
Unfortunately  the two datasets cannot be regarded as independent because  even though the methods through which the frequency estimates were obtained were different  the plants used in the second dataset were a subset of the plants of the first 
We thus have only four independent estimates in each case  and there is minimal power to detect significant deviations from neutrality with such a small sample size 
It should be noted at this stage that deviations from the expected value could also be caused either by slight deviations from the   ratio in the infecting mixed solution  or by deviations from that ratio in the frequency of the viral particles that actually get into the plants 
Second  because of the relatively small sample sizes and low statistical power  the tests presented above could have detected only large deviations The results clearly show  however  precisely that the markers do not have large effects  if any  and that therefore recombination estimates would be affected only very slightly by any hypothetical selective effects of the markers 
Because of this  along with the fact that the introduced markers provoke silent substitutions in the CaMV genome  we assumed that markers were effectively neutral in the rest of the analysis The dataset used to estimate the recombination frequency consisted of the   full genome length viral clones   from each of ten co infected plants  individually genotyped for each of the four markers 
As discussed in detail in the Results  recombination was very frequent and concerned all four markers 
Indeed  approximately half of the genotyped clones exhibited a recombinant genotype 
It was therefore meaningful to try to obtain quantitative estimates of recombination from our data Our aim was to analyze viral recombination in a live host 
Consequently  we had to deal with the fact that more than one viral replication cycle occurred during the   d that infection lasted in our experiment  we had to wait that long for the disease to develop and to be able to recover sufficient amounts of viral DNA from each infection 
Based on the kinetics of gene expression    we postulate that each replication cycle lasts between   and   d  and that therefore seven to ten cycles occurred between infection and the sampling time 
In case this assumption is incorrect  we did calculations assuming five  seven  ten  or   replication cycles during these   d  As shown  the results were not affected qualitatively  and only slightly quantitatively 
It is important to note that we assumed that recombination occurred through a template switching mechanism  and that therefore  from a recombination point of view  the CaMV genome is linear 
The reverse transcription starts and finishes at the position   in Figure   which is the point of circularization of the DNA genome 
This implies that changes between contiguous markers a–b  b–c  and c–d can be considered as true recombination whereas those between a and d cannot  as they may simply stem from circularization of DNA  during the synthesis of which the polymerase has switched template once anywhere between a–b  b–c  or c–d To estimate the recombination rate between markers  we wrote recurrence equations describing the change in frequency of each genotype over one generation  assuming random mating and no selection  i e  the standard Wright–Fisher population genetics model 
We then expressed the frequency of all possible genotypes n generations later as a function of their initial frequency and of the recombination parameters 
Subsequently we calculated the maximum likelihood estimates of the recombination parameters and their asymptotic variances given initial frequencies  we assumed that the two  parental  genotypes  Mark S and Cabb S  had equal initial frequencies of   and that all other genotypes had initial frequencies of zero  and frequencies after n generations  the observed frequencies  as stated above we used different values of n 
All algebraic and numerical calculations were carried out with the software Mathematica The recombination parameters are the recombination rates between two adjacent loci  e g  r
  for the recombination rate between markers a and b  and the interference coefficients  e g  i
  for interference between recombination events in the segments between markers a and b and b and c  To define these parameters we followed Christiansen    and in particular the recombination distributions for two  three  and four loci  respectively  Tables     and   of   
It is important to realize that given the definitions of these parameters  the estimator of the recombination rate between two loci is not affected by the number of loci considered 
In other words  we obtain the same estimation of the recombination rate between markers a and b whether we consider genotypic frequencies at just these two loci  or the frequencies at these two loci plus a third locus  or the complete information to which we have access  the four marker genotypes 
Information on additional loci only affects the estimates of the interference coefficients It proved impossible to carry out the calculations for four loci algebraically 
Instead  we used a computer program to calculate the expected genotypic frequencies at all four loci after n generations  given the above stated initial frequencies and specified recombination parameters 
For each combination of recombination parameters we calculated a Euclidean distance between the vector of the expected genotypic frequencies and the observed genotypic frequencies  and considered that the estimated recombination parameters were those yielding the minimal Euclidean distance 
In all cases  the estimated recombination rates between pairs of loci were equal to the second decimal to those estimated algebraically from data for three or two loci Tumor Restrictions to Oncolytic VirusIn most solid tumors the tumor interior displays a high cellular density with multiple cell types  both malignant and normal  stromal  cells  interdigitated by strands of extracellular matrix  ECM  and other poorly defined tissue 
Stromal cells typically consist of fibroblasts  macrophages  neutrophils and other immune cell types 
Tumor associated fibroblasts are a source of the bulk acellular tissue in tumors    which is largely made up of polysugars and glycoproteins  such as collagens  laminins  fibronectins  proteoglycans  hyaluronan and water  forming a dense matrix around and between the cancer cells   
This matrix provides structural support but also haptotactic and chemotactic guidance for cancer cells   
Moreover  the prevailing tumor interstitium is rich in soluble angiogenic factors  such as members of the vascular endothelial growth factor  VEGF  family    cellular growth factors  including endothelial growth factor  EGF  basic fibroblast growth factor  FGF  platelet derived growth factor  PDGF  and pleiotrophic factors  particularly transforming growth factor  TGF  beta   
Additionally  both tumor  and stromal cells secrete cytokines and chemokines  such as interleukin  IL    IL   tumor necrosis factor  TNF  alpha  stromal cell derived factor  SDF    macrophage migration inhibitory factor  MIF    which on one hand recruit more stromal and progenitor cells into the tumors and on the other hand curb the activity of antigen presenting cells and anti tumor T cells   
In several independent cancer types  high serum levels of IL   and IL   are indicators of poor prognosis   Aberrant tumor and stromal growth combined with an overproduction of matrix leads to high interstitial pressure in the tumor  preventing lateral diffusion of therapeutic compounds within the tumor 
Tight cellular compactness combined with a high tumor proliferation rate also causes physical crowding and puts constraints on oxygenation  which due to aberrant angiogenesis and rupture of the haphazard vessels is mostly incomplete and results in chronic tissue hypoxia toward the tumor cores 
As cancer cells exist in a crowding hypoxic  and cytokine growth factor perpetuated chronic state of stress  they upregulate a number of key cellular molecules that function as a collective defense against a wide range of therapies  including oncolytic viruses 
The properties of oncolytic viruses and their status in clinical development as well as various delivery options have been reviewed elsewhere   
In this review  we provide an overview of two of the main intratumoral barriers to oncolytic virus spread  the extracellular tumor make up and the intracellular antiviral defense mechanisms Tumor cellular structure and composition may in concert with abundant extracellular matrix  ECM  deposition pose a severe hurdle for systemic virus entry and propagation of infection within the tumor 
The extracellular matrix is a complex dense network consisting of multiple proteins  glycoproteins and polysaccharides including collagens  laminins  fibronectins  proteoglycans and hyaluronic acid   
The interstitial fluid pressure  IFP  in the tumor surrounding blood and lymphatic vessels is mainly created by the high cell density that forms an increased physical pressure outwards and does not allow free diffusion of therapeutics   
A high IFP generally predicts an aggressive tumor phenotype as tumor cells tend to escape from tumor margins where the pressure drops  thus facilitating spread of metastatic cells   
On the other hand  for therapeutic virus  interstitial fluid concentration gradients may pose a hurdle as passive diffusion in viable regions  typically the rim  may occur mainly outward   
Given the limited arsenal of known chemicals alleviating tumor compactness and the poor penetration drugs in general into the tumor tissue  this is a considerable problem that may not be easy to tackle 
Some strategies are discussed below Viruses are passive particles and rely either on radial cell to cell spread or on soluble diffusion across concentration gradients to reach their target cells and to propagate the infection 
Tumor matrix is critical in this regard  as it can block both forms of spread 
Passively diffusing viruses may physically not fit through the strands of the ECM 
This was shown for oncolytic herpes virus  which has an outer diameter of over   nm  and whose spreading could be improved by matrix degrading bacterial collagenase co injection   
Bilbao and coworkers showed that adenovirus entry into experimental hepatocellular carcinoma nodules in the livers of immunocompetent rats following intravenous or intraportal injection was directly related to the thickness of the ECM capsule enveloping the nodules   
On the other hand  we found using Semliki Forest virus  which has an outer diameter of about   nm  that even upon intratumoral injection spread was blocked by ECM  which formed a physical barrier for virus infection  Figure  The foremost option to reduce interstitial fluid pressure and to remove physical molecule barriers imposed by the ECM is to use matrix degrading enzymes 
These act by digesting collagen  fibrin  and other types of fibrillar matrix deposits  creating more space between cell clusters  and glycosaminoglycan polymers  known to limit fluid movement in tumors 
Simultaneously  such strategies may also expose more cell surface to viruses  increasing the likelihood of infection 
In a study by Kuriyama  trypsin or collagenase dispase was injected into subcutaneous U  and U  glioma xenografts in immunocompromised mice  followed by a reporter adenovirus   
Both types of ECM degrading enzymes increased tumor transduction by the virus  but when doses got too high  transduction efficacy suffered  demonstrating a balance between ECM degradation and oncolytic virus efficacy 
In another study  treatment of PC  tumors with vaccinia virus producing matrix metalloprotease  MMP    resulted in reduction of collagen IV fibrils and increase in virus penetration into tumor  which yielded elevated virus titers   
Hong et al 
targeted orthotopic neuroblastoma xenografts engineered to express MMP  with oncolytic HSV  achieving increased virus distribution compared to control tumors   
Similar results were obtained when human soft tissue sarcoma HSTS T overexpressing MMP  or MMP  were injected with oncolytic HSV   
MMP expressing tumors contained significantly less sulfated glycosaminoglycans compared to control tumors 
Other enzymes and protein effectors  either engineered into virus expression cassettes or provided exogenously  include hyaluronidase  decorin  various other MMPs  and notably relaxin a peptide hormone normally expressed during particular phase of pregnancy that does not possess tissue degrading activity itself  but instead induces a number of key collagen degrading proteases seemingly in a tumor specific manner   
Beyer showed that relaxin expressed by murine stem cells improved trastuzumab penetrance and therapy outcome in syngeneic tumor models   
In another study  chimeric adenovirus Ad  expressing relaxin showed increased tumor transduction and virus dissemination   Several other strategies to increase penetration of therapeutics in tumors have been developed   
While the stromal ECM capsule of tumor nodules acts as a physical barrier to virus entry following intravenous injection  it was possible to improve tumor infection by administering vaso active compounds  angiotensin II  histamine  nitroglycerine  before the virus   
This is interesting  as vasculature per se would not be expected to alter or influence the physical composition of the ECM  such as collagen strand thickness 
Instead  virus access to the tumor was improved  most likely by increased access from the blood via tumor stromal adjoining vessels 
Interestingly  in a study with oncolytic herpes virus  anti VEGF monoclonal antibody Bevacizumab given before intravenous virus injection gave poorer anti tumor efficacy than when given after the virus   
The study showed that while HSV is able to enter and infect tumors better through their leaky vasculature compared to Bevacizumab normalized vasculature  vascular normalization by Bevacizumab still gave superior combination efficacy when the virus was already in the tumor 
This effect was likely dependent on altering both physical and biological properties of the tumor  including interstitial pressure and oxygenation 
In another study  anti VEGF A antibody injections in nude mice harboring U  human glioma xenografts led to an increase in MMP  expression and reduction in collagen fiber content  facilitating improved distribution of oncolytic adenovirus within the tumor tissue   
In general  targeting tumor vasculature by oncolytic viruses and including agents that affect tumor vasculature in combination regimens is gaining interest    and it will be interesting to see more specific studies on how vascular acting agents may affect the physical barriers to oncolytic viruses Some viruses do not need an extracellular step for propagating infection  such as members of the herpes and poxvirus families  and may be able to spread from cell to cell 
For example  HSV  is able to infect neighboring cells via lateral tight junctions in a manner dependent on its glycoproteins E and I   
Vaccinia virus  on the other hand  induces so called actin tails  which are actin filament driven membranous protrusions of the plasma membrane harboring a single virus particle at the outer tip 
These actin tails actively deliver and deposit virus particles onto or even into neighboring cells   
Because lateral spread without an extracellular step may circumvent neutralizing immunity as well as some of the physical obstacles the tumor microenvironment imposes  this ability has been engineered into viruses that normally do not possess it 
A promising strategy is to engineer OVs to express membrane fusogenic genes  MFGs  such as gibbon ape leukemia virus  GALV  glycoprotein  reptilian reovirus p  protein  FAST  or the membrane glycoproteins H and F of measles virus   
Quite intriguingly  expression of several different MFGs by oncolytic adenovirus synergized with chemotherapy in anti tumor efficacy both in vitro and in vivo    suggesting that membrane fusion facilitated lateral spread of also chemotherapeutics  which otherwise would not have occurred in a compact tumor 
The potential limitation of cell to cell dependent spread  however  may be that membrane free physical barriers  such as the ECM  may still pose a barrier to spread 
Also  it is unclear whether MFGs or other mechanisms of lateral spread may assist in reaching distant tumor nests Some other strategies to alleviate matrix imposed restrictions to oncolytic viruses have been discussed elsewhere   Tumors of epithelial origin mostly retain the firm cellular integrity seen in their original adhesive intercellular configuration 
Several viruses use cellular receptors which are located in paracellular tight junctions  which may be problematic in tightly packed tumors   
Adenovirus C group viruses use coxsackie adenovirus receptor  CAR  as their primary entry point  whereas adenovirus B  group members and measles virus Edmonston use CD  complement binding molecule as their cellular receptor   
Adenovirus B  group  serotypes       and   entry occurs using desmoglein   DSG    
Of these  CAR and DSG  are preferentially located within tight junctions and are hidden from virus binding   
Also the complement receptor CD  was ascribed a role in maintenance of epithelial cell integrity by interactions with the E cadherin catenin network   
These observations imply that before reaching the potential entry site on the tumor cell the virus must find its way into the junctional space 
Moreover  it has become increasingly clear that for example glioma tumors traditionally targeted by Ad  serotype adenoviruses often express only low levels of CAR and instead much higher levels of CD    Beyond that tight junctions hide multiple virus receptors  they contain a network of adhesion molecules  including ZO  cadherins  claudins and occludin  which  if perturbed  is associated with more aggressive disease in many types of cancer   
Since tight junctions also contain important receptors that mediate tumor promoting signaling and which have been targeted by monoclonal antibodies  notably Her  it would be highly useful to develop strategies that temporarily loosen the tight junction contacts even at cost of a transient increase in tumor metastatic risk 
One of the most interesting approaches has been to exploit the natural propensity of adenovirus serotype   which as part of its natural life cycle creates dodecahedral particles  PtDd  consisting of viral capsid proteins  penton base and fiber that open tight junctions by binding to and dissolving desmoglein  dimers and reducing E cadherin expression  to develop a specific tight junction opening molecule  JO    
Adenovirus type   uses PtDds to promote its own infection  opening the tight junctions ahead of infection to maximize access to desmoglein 
Analogously  when administered to human tumor xenografts  JO  facilitated penetration of trastuzumab much deeper into the tumor tissue than when the monoclonal antibody was administered on its own   
Moreover  JO  synergized with several chemotherapeutics in solid tumor models   
Backed by our own findings with oncolytic SFV  showing that both extracellular matrix and tumor cell compactness restrict virus spread and oncolytic efficacy  we believe combination approaches that target both tight junctions and extracellular matrix will prove effective in future virotherapy development  Figure  An alternative approach to increasing tumor penetration by oncolytic viruses is to alter tumor cell morphology and status 
Notably  cell death and in particular the type of cell death induced by virus has been shown to affect virus distribution within a tumor mass  in a study by Nagano et al  administration of apoptosis inducing paclitaxel before injecting oncolytic herpes simplex virus increased virus dissemination in the tumor  allowing its diffuse in  tunnels  created by shrinking dying tumor cells   Maintenance of physiological adherence is essential for proper ECM function and for retaining cellular integrity 
Therefore  a potential caveat of using ECM degrading proteolytic enzymes or tight junction openers is the risk of neoplastic cell detachment from the tumor ECM and increased risk of metastasis 
While ECM degradation or tight junction opening may operate innocuously  there is also a chance that loss of E cadherins via proteases or via non specific deregulation of tight junction integrity during ECM modulating therapy could trigger pro tumorigenic Wnt β catenin signaling  possibly driving epithelial to mesenchymal transition   
One study showed that ectopic relaxin expression stimulated MMP expression and enhanced breast cancer invasiveness    whereas another paper found short term relaxin exposure to increase breast cancer cell motility whereas long term expression reduced both motility and cancer invasiveness   
In the context of oncolytic viruses  Lavilla Alonso tested several proteases  including hyaluronidase  relaxin  and macrophage metalloelastase  and showed they all could assist adenovirus entry into tumors  yet  the authors did not detect treatment induced metastases or increase in tumor invasiveness   
Another strategy possibly balancing some of the putative risks of tight junction disruption could be to use Wnt dependent oncolytic viruses   Tumors are invariably fenestrated by host fibroblasts  myeloid cells and other non transformed cells  which driven by cancer induced cues can adopt various reprogrammed phenotypes to promote tumor angiogenesis and growth and to alter tumor responses to therapies   
As most of them normally play a role in immune homeostasis and pathogen sensing  they also respond to and influence oncolytic virus infection of tumors Fulci et al 
reported that injection of oncolytic HSV  directly into glioblastoma tumor parenchyma triggered upregulation of CD  and CD  monocytic markers and rapid clearance of virus  likely executed by infiltrating phagocytic cells   
When clodronate liposomes were used to deplete macrophages in vivo  the authors observed a  fold increase in virus titers in the brain tumors concomitant with an   reduction in peripheral CD  macrophages in animal spleens  suggesting that CD  cells migrate into the tumors upon virus injection and limit overall oncolytic efficacy 
While CD  cells were not reduced by peripheral macrophage depletion  arguing that these cells had been recruited to the tumors before the treatment  they could be eliminated in live glioma slices ex vivo  resulting in a  fold increase in virus replication 
Macrophages may secrete antiviral type I interferon constitutively at very low  subnanomolar  levels   and recently Liu et al 
showed that tumor resident CD  macrophages induced a protective antiviral state in ovarian and breast tumors which led to resistance to oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus  VSV  infection   
Type I IFN signaling  JAK  inhibitor Ruxolitinib reversed the resistance  facilitating VSV replication in the macrophage protected cancer cells 
It is tempting to speculate that tumor resident macrophages also rendered syngeneic GL  and DBT mouse gliomas completely refractory to VA  oncolytic alphavirus  as these cells were quite infectable in vitro and live glioma slices regained their sensitivity to virus within   h  indicating dilution of IFN I   Macrophages or the closely related myeloid suppressor cells are the predominant stromal cell type in many tumors and are actively recruited during cancer progression   
Heavy macrophage presence in the tumors indicates that such tumors may be resistant to oncolytic virotherapy  unless depleting preconditioning would be used 
Moreover  as part of the early immune response to virus infection  monocytic cells are rapidly recruited to tumors following intratumoral virus injection 
In one study  depletion of either CD b  cells or VEGF secreted by these cells in mice treated with oncolytic HSV  greatly increased oncolytic efficacy  tentatively linking pro tumorigenic and antiviral angiogenic mechanisms   Another key pro tumorigenic signaling employed by many tumors is up regulation of CXCR  the receptor for chemokine CXCL   also known as SDF  and recruitment of stromal cells expressing CXCL  which maintain the tumor and recruit additional cells to support tumor expansion and invasion  such as endothelial cell progenitors which contribute to neovascularization   
Indeed  high CXCR  expression is a negative prognostic factor for many cancers 
Oncolytic vaccinia virus engineered to express a soluble antagonist of CXCR  showed improved intratumoral virus replication  increased vascular disruption and a markedly reduced infiltration of the tumors by putative immune suppressive and tumor promoting stromal cells   
This study highlights how reducing pro tumor stromal cell effects may alleviate antiviral resistance and yield increased overall therapeutic efficacy 
On the other hand  if the paracrine antiviral effects of tumor homing monocytic cells could be selectively abrogated these cells could favorably be used to ferry oncolytic viruses into tumors 
Indeed  a significant delay in metastatic tumor potential was achieved when macrophages were harnessed to deliver a tumor specific oncolytic adenovirus   What is the antiviral status in human cancer 
Recent analyses from different normal cells that occupy the same organ reveal striking functional variation in components of the type I IFN signaling pathway that correlate with the tissue tropism and virulence of some virus strains   
Can similar variation in such components be found in cancer cells  or do cancer cells make an exception Transformed cells undergo selective elimination by the immune system before becoming cancerous  termed immunoediting  based on observations of differential capacity of immunocompetent mice to reject tumors previously grown in immunocompromised hosts versus syngeneic animals   
Cancer cell responsiveness to type I and type II IFNs plays a role during immunoediting  cancer cells that eventually progress to form a tumor display reduced capacity to respond to IFN gamma  which otherwise would upregulate MHC class I molecules and render the tumors amenable to CD  T cell mediated destruction  whereas responsiveness to type I interferon initially helps tumors avoid immune purging during the editing phase and is then irrelevant   
Of note  the anti tumor effects of type I IFN  still exploited today in several cancers  were shown to depend on host NK cells  and mice in which IFNAR was blocked by monoclonal antibody failed to reject even highly immunogenic tumors  as opposed to mice treated with control antibody  who all rejected the immunogenic tumor challenge   
Thus  whereas tumor responsiveness to type I IFN is not predetermined after immunoediting  other factors post immunoediting may influence it In several tumor types  varying levels of expression of components of the type I IFN signaling cascade have been detected  and in some tumor types these components have been found to have prognostic value  whereas in others they do not seem to influence survival   
However  emerging data suggests that antiviral genes may predict poor survival because they increase treatment resistance 
In one study  poor prognosis of several types of cancer due to genotoxic treatment resistance was found to correlate with increased activity of IFN I pathway genes   
In this study  a triad of type I IFN signaling pathway genes  STAT  ISG  and IFIT  formed a pan tumor type negative prognostic factor  and a broader seven gene cluster established negative prognostic criteria for treatment resistant breast cancer 
Treatment resistance was subsequently shown to depend on STAT  signaling  STAT expressing tumor clones were positively selected in animals in vivo  demonstrating increased proliferation and metastatic potential  and STAT expression mediated resistance against genotoxic assault by doxorubicin or ionizing radiation  knockdown of STAT  resulted in lower proliferation rate and metastatic capacity and increased sensitivity to genotoxic stress    
In another study  resistance to epigenetic DNA modifiers  AZA dC  a methyltransferase inhibitor  and LBH  or MGCD  both histone deacetylase  HDAC  inhibitors  was correlated with increased expression of IFN I pathway genes in small lung cancer cells   
Basal IFN related gene expression in several different SML cell lines was upregulated Interestingly  in many cancers  STAT proteins are not phosphorylated and persist in unphosphorylated form  U STAT 
Like its phosphorylated counterpart  U STAT  increases expression of genes contributing to resistance to DNA damaging agents   
While it is currently unknown why cancers may prefer to use unphosphorylated forms  it is known that U STATs activate distinct signals compared to their phosphorylated counterparts 
However  importantly for oncolytic viruses  in many tumors  constant expression and release of type I IFN leads to a constitutively high level of unphosphorylated forms of STAT  STAT  and IRF  which together form an unphosphorylated but functional ISGF like complex that relocalizes to the nucleus and drives expression of a specific set of ISGs distinct from acute IFN I exposure   
These ISGs are sufficient to maintain a functional antiviral defense and they play a critical role in resistance to DNA damaging agents On a cellular level  virus replication is controlled by antiviral defense molecules    which in turn are primarily controlled by type I IFN signaling 
In addition to classical type I IFN  or cytokine induced antiviral signaling  tumors may employ other antiviral defense mechanisms 
For example  stromal cells may secrete peptides with antiviral properties called defensins   
The defensins are amphiphatic and typically  –  amino acids in length and interfere with viruses by physically binding to and disrupting virus particles and or by inducing antiviral responses in target cells via pattern recognition receptors 
At least oral squamous cell carcinomas were found to overexpress defensins compared to normal control tissues   
While the role of defensins in oncolytic virus infection of tumors is unclear  one study showed that the immune stimulating properties of defensins may be exploited to increase overall therapeutic efficacy 
In this study  expression of beta   defensin from a conditionally replicating adenovirus yielded a superior therapeutic entity compared to the unarmed parental virus via enhanced anti tumor immune responses mediated by TLR dependent activation of dendritic cells   In summary  human cancers display varying degrees of expression of antiviral proteins or their signaling regulators at baseline 
Some of these may increase in response to genotoxic anti cancer treatments 
In the next chapter we will highlight some of the consequences to oncolytic virotherapy of the heterogeneity in type I IFN responsiveness in tumor cells All oncolytic viruses tested to date display variable infectivity in different cancer cell lines 
This variability is likely at least partly dependent on type I IFN as most oncolytic viruses are IFN sensitive 
IFN secretion follows virus sensing by the cells via Toll like receptors expressed on both the plasma membrane and in endocytotic vesicles  NOD like receptors  STING  AIM  NLP inflammosome and other danger sensing molecules  summarized elsewhere   
While all viruses carry an arsenal of counteracting molecules    no virus goes completely undetected 
Even HSV amplicons  which are devoid of functional virus genes  induce a type I IFN response that mediates a STAT dependent system wide antiviral defense in mice within one hour of intravenous vector injection  resulting in significant reduction of transgene expression compared to expression in STAT  knockout animals   During our own studies with attenuated SFV vector VA  it became apparent that the dramatic and lasting therapeutic efficacy achieved following mere single intravenous  or intratumoral  injection of the virus in immunocompromised mice bearing human A  melanoma or U  glioma xenografts   was not going to be recapitulated easily in immunocompetent animals   
The paradox in our studies was that while oncolytic SFV vector VA  effectively replicated in and destroyed a variety of IFN responsive cancer cell lines in vitro  it consistently failed to eradicate tumors generated from the same cell types in vivo  even if large doses of virus were injected directly into the tumor mass and even if the tumors were void of visible physical barriers  Figure  
Conversely  only tumors generated from IFN unresponsive cancer cells have seemed infectable in vivo by VA  so far 
In light of earlier findings by others  showing that type I IFN receptor knockout mice are highly susceptible to SFV infection and quickly succumb to multi organ systemic infection    the parameters for oncolytic SFV efficacy seem clear  tumor cells must be defective in type I IFN response for the virus to be effective These findings are in line with emerging data from other groups  showing a remarkably strict dependence of oncolytic virus replication on defective type I IFN responsiveness  a dogma introduced at the turn of the  st century   
For example  sarcomas and melanomas display differing permissiveness to oncolytic VSV  an obstacle which may be overcome by blocking type I IFN signaling   
In eight sarcoma cell lines  basal up regulation of RIG I and IFIT  and rapid induction of STAT  phosphorylation upon IFN I treatment correlated with resistance to oncolytic measles virus   
In other studies  human pancreatic and ovarian cancer cells display resistance against Rb dependent oncolytic adenovirus  strongly correlating with intracellular levels of MxA  and acquired resistance to repeated oncolytic adenovirus injections in an intraperitoneal ovarian carcinoma model was associated with an increase in MxA as well as several other key ISGs in the tumors   
A study comparing normal human or mouse melanocytes to a panel of melanoma cells revealed strong correlation between permissiveness to oncolytic VSV and capacity to mount antiviral defense in response to type I IFN   
In this study  VSV rp  harboring two mutations in P and L genes  was superior to several other tested oncolytic VSV strains  but the dependence on defective IFN responsiveness was still retained 
In yet another study  oncolytic VSV replicated in four out of twelve mesothelioma cell lines which were unable to mount antiviral defense upon IFN beta pretreatment or to respond to infection by up regulation of PKR  MxA or  OAS mRNA   
In contrast  the non permissive mesothelioma cells mounted antiviral defense  associated with PKR  MxA or  OAS mRNA up regulation  in response to infection or to exogenous type I IFN 
The authors of this study further linked the observed pattern of virus resistance to clinical mesothelioma samples  where in a mesothelioma tissue array  significant variance in immunoreactivity against PKR  p  and or IFNAR was observed  with only a few samples displaying lack of reactivity against all three components  arguing that most tumors in clinical settings would display at least some level of resistance to oncolytic VSV Oncolytic adenoviruses are often deleted for E A  which normally binds Rb and prevents it from sequestering E F  which results in the viruses being unable to replicate in normal cells 
However  since adenovirus  as with all viruses  contains elements that antagonize antiviral defenses  such elements have also been targets for deletion to render the virus sensitive to innate antiviral defenses  which would be expected to remain intact only in normal cells 
Cancer cells expressing Ras may down regulate protein kinase R and inhibit type I IFN induction by interfering with RIG I signaling   
Also  select interferon stimulated genes appear to be repressed by the Ras MEK ERK signaling cascade   
PKR activation shuts down E F dependent translation  including translation of virus messenger RNAs 
Therefore  an adenovirus deleted for VA RNA  which antagonizes PKR  should be capable of replicating in Ras overexpressing  tumor  cells 
However  while this was seemingly the case    it was later discovered that Ras is not an obligatory determinant for PKR inactivation and that virus replication was halted even in Ras overexpressing cells via functional PKR mediated E F phosphorylation  implying that the parameters of VA RNA deleted adenovirus replication had to be revised   
Similar findings were obtained with oncolytic reovirus  against which Ras independent tumor resistance emerged in vivo   
Thus  under some circumstances even tumor cells over expressing Ras may respond to type I IFN or to stimulants of pattern recognition receptors  activating PKR and inhibiting virus translation 
To complicate matters  MEK inhibitors have been shown restore antiviral signaling capacity in Ras overexpressing tumors   
This implies that human tumors treated with MEK inhibitors  such as Trametinib which was recently approved for treatment of BRAF mutated melanoma  may be poor targets for oncolytic viruses as antiviral signaling capacity in such tumors may be restored Some oncolytic viruses  such as members of the poxvirus family  are seemingly resistant to the antiviral effects of type I IFNs in vitro and may be controlled by other cellular factors   
However  in most cases  sensitivity or resistance to type I IFN is assessed in vitro and using only one cytokine  which may mask synergies with other factors present in vivo 
One possible explanation for the in vitro–in vivo discrepancy is the tumor micro environment  which not only imposes physical barriers to oncolytic viruses but also alters intracellular antiviral defenses 
For example  glioma cells were found in the brain to spontaneously secrete type I IFN  which conferred resistance against oncolytic HSV 
Resistance was linked to ECM protein CCN  interaction with glioma cell surface receptor alpha   beta   integrin  which activated interferon secretion   
It is tempting to speculate whether this or a similar ECM glioma interaction could have contributed to the resistance of syngeneic glioma cells we observed in vivo but not in vitro to both oncolytic SFV and vaccinia virus  FIG    
Also  while critical in many respects  antiviral signaling may occur without signaling via type I IFN receptor  IFNAR 
For instance  upon infection of IFNAR KO mice with murine hepatitis virus  MHV  brain cells were found to have upregulated antiviral GTPase TGTP and IFITm  and IFITm  all of which have confirmed antiviral activity in vivo against a variety of viruses   
In these cases  IFN gamma and TNF alpha likely account for at least part of the observed ISG activity  where e g  TGTP is upregulated by IFN γ signaling and TNFα has been shown to induce ISG  independently of IFNAR   Interestingly  while most cancers are heterogeneous in antiviral defence signaling  one broad class of tumors in particular may display consistently low capacity to ward off oncolytic viruses  oncovirus induced cancers 
This is because oncoviruses  as all viruses  carry a complement of factors that abrogate antiviral sensors and effectors  which may result in tumors that are uniformly devoid of antiviral signaling 
In an intriguing study  oncolytic VSV infected and destroyed human papilloma virus  HPV positive cervical carcinoma cells more effectively than HPV negative head  and neck cancer cells due to HPV E mediated suppression of antiviral signaling   
HPV positive or E expressing xenografts were efficiently eradicated from nude mice following VSV injection 
The potential of this approach is that even oncolytic viruses that are extremely sensitive to type I IFN  such as attenuated SFV or M mutated VSV  may function well against oncovirus induced cancers where the oncovirus machinery ensures the lack of antiviral defense While on first thought it would appear counterintuitive to antagonize the very factors that keep oncolytic viruses tumor specific  emerging data shows that this can be accomplished in a safe way 
One of the foremost strategies to increase oncolytic virus efficacy is to combine them with drugs that lower tumor antiviral defenses 
In this regard  a primary target for interference is the prototypical type I IFN signaling cascade 
While small molecular inhibitors against IFNAR are not available  activity of downstream signaling transducers may effectively be blocked 
Human pancreatic cancer cells were shown to constitutively express high levels of MxA and OAS and to mount type I IFN dependent resistance to oncolytic VSV 
Resistance could be overcome by blocking activity of IFNAR associated Janus kinase  JAK      
Similarly  JAK  inhibitor ruxolitinib overcame type I IFN dependent resistance of human SCC  head and neck cancer cells against oncolytic VSV   
Ruxolitinib also successfully abrogated type I IFN mediated antiviral effects elicited by macrophages    highlighting that this drug might also alleviate type I IFN dependent tumor resistance to oncolytic viruses imposed by stromal cells 
However  the obvious downside to using JAK inhibitors is their effects on critical host defense mechanisms  which may result in increased infection of normal cells 
Moreover  JAK inhibitors may reduce anti tumor immune responses elicited by oncolytic virotherapy 
For example  ruxolitinib was shown to impair the capacity of dendritic cells promote CD  T cell responses against model tumor antigens   
On the other hand  in this study clearance of adenovirus was delayed in ruxolitinib treated normal animals  which makes it difficult to predict the overall impact of JAK inhibitors on tumor therapy where prolonged virus presence might translate to better therapeutic efficacy 
Also  while the immune stimulating and anti tumor effects of type I and type II interferons may be adversely affected by JAK inhibitors  central tumor promoting cascades mediated by JAKs  such as IL STAT  may also be inhibited    yielding a difficult to predict net therapeutic outcome 
At the moment  more studies are needed to establish the overall impact of interference with JAK  signaling in cancer therapy Spurred by earlier reports of oncovirus reactivation and promoter enhancement by histone deacetylase  HDAC  inhibitors  this class of agents was assessed for capacity to enhance oncolytic virus potency by inhibiting antiviral responses 
Indeed  such enhancement was observed with oncolytic VSV and SFV  and while it has been difficult to pinpoint the exact mechanisms that underlie HDAC inhibitor enhancement of oncolytic virus replication in cancer cells  antiviral defenses in general are inhibited for yet unknown reasons mainly in cancer cells and not in normal cells  which indirectly facilitates virus replication   
Interestingly  combination of HDAC inhibitors with conditionally replicating   E A deleted adenovirus gave improved virus replication rate and therapeutic efficacy in subcutaneous xenograft models only when the inhibitors were given before the virus  otherwise inhibition of replication was observed   
Similarly  HDAC inhibitors increased replication and oncolytic efficacy of HSV when given before the virus but not when given at the same time   
With nuclear DNA viruses  such as adenovirus and HSV  it is possible that HDAC inhibitors also alter virus genome accessibility to transcription factors  resulting in reduced replication or other adverse effects  implying that with these viruses HDAC inhibitors should be administered before the viruses Recently  it was found that HDAC inhibitor vorinostat activates NfκB signaling by facilitating hyperacetylation of the p  subunit  which in turn activates cellular autophagy   
Autophagy was in another study shown to be important for VSV replication  presumably by inhibiting antiviral signaling 
This is interesting  as a previous study revealed enhancement of VSV replication by inhibiting TNF alpha induced antiviral signaling mediated by p  using NfκB inhibitors BMS  or TPCA    
In this study  neither inhibitor had an effect on STAT  or STAT  phosphorylation or their nuclear relocalization in response to type I IFN but the authors observed clear induction of ISG  GBP  and MX  in response to type I IFN in U  glioma cells  with the latter two being dependent on NfκB signaling 
Taken together  NfκB pathway activation may result in different antiviral responses in different cancer types  and inhibition or enhancement of oncolytic viruses by NfκB inhibitors is dependent on other concomitant cellular mechanisms  such as autophagy Since HDAC inhibitors modulate promoter activity accessibility  it is conceivable other epigenetic or promoter modifying agents could work in a similar manner to repress antiviral defense induction and enhance oncolytic viruses   
DNA demethylating agents  azacytidine  Aza  and decitabine synergized with oncolytic herpes simplex type   virus in glioma models in vitro and in vivo  as did HDAC inhibitor valproic acid  VPA  which was already shown before to work well with oncolytic HSV as well as several other oncolytic viruses   
Moreover  inhibition of cancer antiviral defenses  specifically RNAseL and PKR  resulted when cancer cells were exposed to sunitinib  a multi tyrosine kinase inhibitor originally developed as an inhibitor of VEGF R and PDGF R signaling  yielding strong anti tumor synergy with IFN sensitive oncolytic VSV   
Since sunitinib is approved for renal cell carcinoma and imatinib resistant gastric cancers  combination with oncolytic VSV constitutes a promising and clinically relevant approach warranting further investigation 
Interstingly  sunitinib as well as several other receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors displayed antiviral effects against polyomavirus BK    arguing that these compounds are not universal virus enhancers Cyclophosphamide  CPA  is a general immunosuppressant used to minimize Treg presence during immunotherapy and also oncolytic virotherapy 
CPA may  however  also enhance replication and efficacy of oncolytic viruses by diminishing cytokine secretion by stromal cells  including type I IFN   
Another compound enhancing oncolytic virus efficacy by lowering cell responsiveness to type I IFN is triptolide  which acts downstream of IRF  activation   
Further  the kinase mammalian target of rapamycin  mTOR  enhances the antiviral effects of type I IFN by activation of its effector proteins  E BP  which binds and inactivates translation factor eIF E  and S K  which carries out cell type specific signaling functions of type I IFN  such as activation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor  B and promotion of ISG  transcription 
Consequently  rapamycin was able to enhance oncolytic VSV replication and anti tumor efficacy by inhibiting type I IFN mediated antiviral signaling via mTOR   Several other compounds synergizing with oncolytic viruses have been identified via high throughput drug library screening  many of which seem to act by antagonizing antiviral defenses 
For instance  a novel virus sensitizer  Vse  was found to greatly diminish antiviral effects of type I IFN against oncolytic VSV in several cancer cell types  and the drug also synergized with the virus in subcutaneous mouse tumor models   
For many of these new compounds  the mechanism of action is still poorly understood  necessitating extensive safety studies to exclude undesirable effects against normal cells Apart from classical type I IFN induced antiviral defenses  which typically prevent virus translation and degrade virus genomes  other cellular machineries regulate oncolytic virus efficacy 
Notably  strategies to increase cancer cell death in response to oncolytic viruses have been tested 
In a recent study  a class of compounds called SMAC mimetics synergized in several cancer models with oncolytic VSV by removing cancer cell block to apoptosis in response to virus induced type I IFN  TNF α or TRAIL   
Interestingly  since virus infection triggered cytokines act on nearby non infected cells  SMAC mimetics may in combination with oncolytic viruses also cause significant bystander tumor destruction 
Normal cells are not affected by the IFN SMAC mimetic synergy  providing an important safety aspect 
In another study  blocking the ER stress response circuitry triggered by oncolytic rhabdovirus infection by a small molecular inhibitor of serine threonine protein kinase and endoribonuclease IRE α  which was identified in a genome wide siRNA screen  greatly enhanced cytotoxicity via caspase induced apoptosis and increased oncolytic efficacy in refractory tumor models in mice   
This effect was independent on induction or responsiveness to type I IFN 
Conversely  inhibitors of nucleoside transporter   ENT  were discovered from a high throughput screen of enhancers of oncolytic HSV  and to date such inhibitors have not been reported to alter cellular antiviral responses   
Other compounds  such as common chemotherapeutics  and their mechanisms synergizing with oncolytic viruses have been discussed elsewhere for most of them the possible role of antiviral defense antagonism in enhancing oncolytic virus efficacy remains to be studied   Thus  many compounds are available to interfere with tumor antiviral defenses 
The outstanding question for most of them  however  seems to be why such compounds do not render normal cells sensitive to oncolytic viruses 
Elucidation of the exact mechanisms of action and the differences between normal and cancer cells constitute a worthy goal for studies in the near future Already in the  s it became clear that using certain pathogenic wildtype viruses  such as West Nile virus and Bunyamwera virus  in cancer patients would result in off target toxicity   
Characteristic for pathogenic viruses is a greater ability to circumvent or antagonize cellular innate antiviral defenses than attenuated strains 
For example  unlike the prototypical oncolytic reovirus strain type   Dearing  the T L strain of reovirus causes accumulation of IRF  in the nucleus and inhibits activation of a select group of ISGs yet because of this property the T L strain is myocarditic unlike the oncolytic type   Dearing strain   
For these reasons  many oncolytic viruses used today  such as reovirus type   Dearing  oncolytic strains of Newcastle disease virus and M mutated VSV have either a stronger capacity to induce or a weaker capacity to resist antiviral type I IFN than the corresponding wildtype strains   An open question  however  is whether strain specific or virus specific differences that relate to specific components of the cellular antiviral machinery may be exploited for greater anti tumor efficacy  i e  if one virus fails  could another be used in its stead 
While Ras expression was critical for oncolytic reovirus replication in cells overexpressing CUG  oncogene  oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus was unable to replicate in the same cells due to increased activation of STAT  and OASL    
Thus  in these cells reovirus was not affected by STAT  or OASL  and it therefore remains interesting to see which other antiviral effectors may have been lacking in the CUG expressing cells and  conversely  how reovirus and VSV differ in terms of sensitivity to antiviral effectors 
While several oncolytic viruses have been compared to each other in terms of replication rate and cytotoxicity  systematic studies with regard to tumor antiviral defenses have not been conducted As any attenuated virus is likely to replicate effectively only in its own niche  i e  to be restricted by a specific set of ISGs  and as wild type strains may be too toxic for use in humans  a compromise may be achieved by incorporating select elements from wild type viruses into oncolytic virus backbones 
Indeed  several chimeric and recombinant viruses have been generated that harbor specific elements of wild type strains or even of other unrelated viruses in order to better resist cancer antiviral defenses  Table  
As an example of introducing wild type elements into attenuated viruses  Haralambieva reported on a measles virus Edmonston vaccine strain in which P gene was replaced with the counterpart from the wild type IC B strain   
Later  Meng et al 
included N  P  and L genes from wild type measles in Edmonston backbone  producing an enhanced but still safe oncolytic virus   
Edmonston vaccine virus induces a more robust IFN response compared to wild type measles virus partly due to the weaker ability of V protein to suppress MDA mediated activation of IRF  and IFN I induction   
In vivo  P gene encoded proteins  particularly V  control the quality of the cytokine response to measles so that vaccine strains qualitatively induce a stronger inflammatory response compared to WT strains  where WT V protein suppresses multiple cytokine secretion 
V protein short cytoplasmic tail has been shown to bind and inactivate STAT  IRF  MDA  and the Rel homology domain of the NfκB subunit p  but not of p    
Also  V causes LGP  protein to bind and inactivate RIG I    but it seemingly does not interfere with TICAM   TRIF  multiple TLR adaptor  including TLR mediated IFN β induction 
Thus  if cancer and normal cells would differ with regard to TICAM  or IRF  then such a virus could potentially target specifically cancer cells rather than normal cells 
So far  the measles Edmonston WT chimeras have proven safe in animals As an example of heterologous virus constructs  lentogenic Newcastle disease virus engineered to express influenza virus PR   H N  NS  showed enhanced oncolytic efficacy in vivo due to dampening of antiviral responses   
While such a virus did not display enhanced pathogenicity in that study  a mesogenic NDV virus harboring NS  from influenza strain H N  did show increased pathogenicity in chickens as well as an increased ability to replicate in human cells    raising some cautionary warnings for future engineering of similar replicative viruses 
As another example  vaccinia virus soluble type I IFN scavenger B R  NOTE  B R is often used in the literature  has been engineered into both oncolytic HSV and oncolytic rhabdoviruses  resulting in all cases in more effective therapy agents without loss of tumor specificity   
Oncolytic γ  gene deleted HSV was complemented by two different PKR antagonists from human cytomegalovirus  TRS  and IRS  generating a chimera capable of reaching wild type virus replication levels in cancer cells in vitro and in tumor models in vivo   The selection of various viral IFN I antagonists that potentially could be used to augment attenuated oncolytic viruses is vast   
For example  increased replication of several viruses  including HIV  Sindbis virus and E deleted adenovirus in mammalian cells was observed when the cells were engineered to express vaccinia virus E L protein  influenza A virus NS  protein  ebola virus VP  protein or HIV  Tat protein   
The choice of antagonist must primarily be made with safety in mind  but virus specific and cell specific differences in antagonist functions may potentially be exploited rationally when considering the overall combination 
For example  vaccinia virus E L is able to rescue VSV but not EMCV from exogenous IFN  whereas vaccinia virus K L partially rescued EMCV but not VSV   In anticipation of systematic  perhaps bioinformatically guided   super chimera  studies  two or more viruses that may complement each other s shortcomings in antiviral defense antagonism have been considered 
Notably  vaccinia virus was favorably combined with IFN I sensitive oncolytic VSV and SFV  yielding tumor model dependent increases in overall therapy efficacy that were dependent on vaccinia virus antagonism of type I IFN responses  which increased the replication of the IFN sensitive viruses   
Such heterologous virotherapy approaches may also be used to generate immunological synergy  similar to heterologous prime boost vaccination  anti tumor immune responses may be increased due to targeting of the tumor by two different viruses  on two separate occasions  but anti virus immune responses would be generated against different viruses each time  avoiding the problem of neutralizing immunity to and predominance of antivirus immune responses   
Some other ideas explored experimentally include engineering oncolytic viruses to express other oncolytic viruses 
For example  the entire oncolytic parvovirus H  genome was placed under a regulatable promoter in oncolytic adenovirus  resulting in a more effective therapeutic entity than either virus alone without loss of tumor specificity   
The genetic material of Semliki Forest virus replicons has been engineered into adenovirus and vaccinia virus backbones   and several other virus chimeras have been constructed   
However  the effects on tumor antiviral defenses of such a constructs remain to be studied The attribute  oncolytic  implies for a virus that it infects and  indeed  lyses the infected tumor 
This property is primarily tested in vitro in cultured tumor cells 
We have learned  however  that in the native tumor microenvironment in living hosts many viruses are no longer able to infect tumor cells or to kill them even if they manage to infect them 
Tightly packed tumor cells and the network of supportive molecules of the extracellular matrix form a physical barrier to virus particle diffusion 
It has also become evident that the tumor cells themselves may be much more capable of thwarting oncolytic virus advances than previously thought  with some tumor cells residing in a seemingly permanent non permissive antiviral state 
Tumors harbor multiple cell types in addition to the neoplastic cells  which may promote and propagate both physical and cellular virus resistance 
As the efficacy of virotherapy in human cancer patients still falls shy of the achievements in animal models  it appears quite plausible that one or more of the barriers described in this review indeed constitute a real and formidable obstacle for oncolytic virus advancement into routine clinical use 
Fortunately  some of the most difficult barriers have been identified  and a rapidly expanding arsenal of countermeasures is at our disposal 
Our task is now to separate the wheat from the chaff and to systematically evaluate the proposed combination regimens that will yield the best results without compromising patient safety Evidence of prenatal toxicity of herbal based indigenous formulations for sex selection in rat modelsTraditional or indigenous preparations  IPs  are getting considerable attention in global health debates  It continues to be used widely in several countries and its consumption is rapidly increasing 
 
  Many reports have documented the use of such preparations 
For instance  in China  traditional herbal medicines played a critical role during the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome  SARS  In fact  many drugs in modern medicine had their roots in the traditional system of medicine 
Drugs like Penicillin  from Penicillium fungi  and Digoxin  from Digitalis purpurea  are some such examples 
One of the promising therapies for Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus  MRSA  infection is a ninth century treatment for eye infections which is a recipe consisting of garlic and onions  wine  and bile from a cow s stomach brewed in a brass cauldron 
It is however important to note that culture specific practices are not always safe 
Digitalis is a classic example where herbalists use this plant in allopathic treatment strategies  while in some countries such as Britain  law restricts their vast availability  A report from Australia describes the adverse effects of ‘herbal  preparations or IPs  Problems arise when people do not report about the consumption of such preparations assuming that these are devoid of any side effects by virtue of them being natural products  The need for research in this field is huge and scientific research into the quality  safety  molecular effects and clinical efficacy is crucial 
 
 
Pregnancy is considered a time of minimal intervention  and a period when herbal medicines are usually contraindicated  It is reported that many women consume indigenous medicines  that contains Bryonia laciniosa  Quercus infectoria and Putranjiva roxburghii along with other ingredients  during early pregnancy to beget a male child in India 
These preparations  often called sex selection drugs  SSD  contain herbal ingredients but these are off the label prescriptions and hence cannot be certified as ‘herbal  medicines 
The prevalence of consumption varies from   to as high as         Studies have indicated that there is  –  times higher risk of birth defects including major malformations of internal organs like urogenital and renal malformation  trachea esophageal fistula  and visible defects like spina bifida  cleft lip palate and imperforate anus 
 
  Risk of stillbirths also increases   folds 
Studies suggest that a single exposure during pregnancy can be deleterious 
 
 
 
  SSDs are reported to contain phytoestrogens  steroids and heavy metals 
 
 
 
  It is also known that although placenta serves as a barrier  most drugs and environmental chemicals enter the foetal circulation by passive diffusion or active transport  However  despite growing evidence on deleterious effects of these herbal formulations  few studies have attempted to systematically understand the risk of such preparations using animal models 
Genetic sex of a child is determined at the time of conception by the fertilization of the ovum with X or Y sperms and intake of so called preparations for sex selection can never alter that In view of these  the current study was conducted with an objective to determine the embryo foetal and development toxicity of SSDs following maternal exposure during critical period of organogenesis using a small animal model The study was guided by the OECD guidelines for testing of chemicals  Guideline no    adopted on  nd January   Prenatal Developmental Toxicity Study  and was based on a mutually approved protocol 
Personal protection equipment was employed as required while handling the test system The test facility is registered and renewed  No 
 PO RcBi S CPCSEA dated July     for breeding and to conduct research on animals for commercial purpose by the committee for the purpose of control and supervision of experiments on animals  CPCSEA  Ministry of Environment  Forests and Climate Change  Government of India 
The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee  Venus Medicine Research Center 
Due permission was taken from the Ethics Committee of Indian Institute of Public Health Delhi For this experiment  strain of Sprague Dawley of rats  Rattus norvegicus  was used 
The number of dams per group was   instead of   as laid down under OECD guidelines 
Rats of both sexes  –  g  were obtained from National Institute of Biologicals  India at  –  weeks of age  acclimatized for five days and then subjected to the experiment at  –  weeks of age 
They were housed in standard polypropylene rat cages with stainless steel top grill  one dam per cage  at a temperature of       °C  with  –  relative humidity 
Bedding material and cages were changed once in six days and   hourly light dark cycle was followed 
Animals were identified by their existing ear numbering 
Cages were labelled by tags indicating the study number  sex  group of the animals  experimental start and completion dates 
Standard pelleted feed  from Ashirwad Industries  Mohali  India  was provided ad libitum to all the animals 
They also had free access to purified water via drinking bottles throughout the study 
The feed  cages and drinking bottles were not analysed for the presence of phytoestrogens and bisphenol A 
However  similar materials were used for all the rats across all groups The drug comprised of IPs for sex selection  SSD 
These non branded locally made preparations are made available  –  days after placing an order and are never sold openly 
These preparations essentially contain herbal ingredients such as Shivlingi  Bryonia laciniosa  Majuphal  Quercus infectoria  Putrajeevak  Putranjiva roxburghii  Nagkesar  Mesua ferrea  and feather of peacock  Pavo cristatus 
A total of   such samples of SSDs were procured from varied sources like ‘pansari  shop owners  grocers  local alternative medicine practitioners  rickshaw pullers  drivers and commoners from different states 
SSDs are advised to be consumed between   and   weeks of pregnancy The samples were categorized into   groups based on redundancy of the preparations and common ingredients reported 
This was followed by chemical analysis in an accredited laboratory to detect the presence of phytoestrogens and steroids 
Since we explored the toxic effects of these preparations we wanted to select two samples that would be most predictive of toxicity 
Due to resource constraints  we did not want to subject all the   samples for animal study 
Hence  three samples of SSDs  found to be most rich in phenols and steroids were selected for toxicity study  All the three samples were also tested for heavy metals which suggested that Lead and Mercury were in very high quantities  The toxicity was examined using C  elegans  an alternate animal model 
Survival analysis and reproductive toxicity was assessed from the brood size and progeny count assay  The two SSDs that were found to be most toxic were selected as test items for the subsequent study in rat models 
SSD   was reported to contain Shivlingi and Putrajeevak while SSD   contained Shivlingi  Majuphal  Putrajeevak  Nagkesar and feathers of peacock 
Both the samples were obtained from grocers 
Local preparations like these are bound to have certain degree of variability in concentrations but more often than not  these remain the major ingredients According to studies reported  women consume such preparations along with cow s milk in dosages and schedule that are quite varied 
While some advise these IPs to be consumed for one day  others prescribe it for   days  to be taken thrice a day 
We considered the amount of SSDs most commonly reported by pregnant women  weighing   kg  which was  –  g daily for   days 
The dose of the test item   mg kg  was calculated by using conversion factor of  Conversion factor is the ratio of the correction factors  estimated by dividing the average body weight in kgs of species by the body surface area in m  of the species  Km 
Human equivalent dose  HED in mg kg    Animal dose  mg kg  X correction factor  Km animal Km human 
Kms of every species are constant 
For humans it is    assuming average weight of adults to be   kg a surface area of   m  and for rats it is  Therefore  HED   mg  kg    animal dose X  
Or  animal dose         mg kg           mg kg Since pregnant women consume these orally  these were administered to rats by oral route The test items were coded as SSD   and SSD   and were provided to the experimental laboratory  Venus Medicine Research Center  Baddi  in powder form 
On the day of dosing  the doses were administered between  –  h  The test items were administered in fresh cow s milk at a final volume of   ml kg 
The doses were calculated on the basis of the latest body weight recorded for the study 
A stainless steel gavage cannula fitted to a calibrated syringe was used for dosing the animals For control animals  cow s milk was used as a vehicle while feeding The study was performed in two phases to evaluate the effect of SSD consumption duration during gestation period Adult  nulliparous female rats were mated with males of same species and strain in  
Each morning  dams were examined for the presence of a vaginal plug and vaginal smear was taken from each dam by using pipette smear technique 
The day of vaginal plug formation or sperms observed in vaginal smear  also known as successful mating  were considered as GD   Gestation day  
The mated females were housed individually in clear polycarbonate cages with stainless steel wire lids 
Mating process was carried out to result in   pregnant animals per group 
Successfully mated females were randomized into control and treatment groups 
All the rats were sacrificed on GD  
According to OECD guidelines  the test chemical should be administered daily from implantation to the day prior to scheduled caesarean section in order to assess toxicity 
Test chemicals were administered to pregnant animals and sacrificed as per the schedule  which was as close as possible to the normal day of delivery without risking loss of data resulting from early delivery i e GD  
The females were killed  before caesarean section  the uterine contents were examined  and the fetuses were evaluated for soft tissue and skeletal changes The pregnant rats were randomized to two intervention and one control groups 
SSD was given during pre implantation to implantation stage  GD  – 
Each group of rats was treated either with vehicle  G  VC  SSD   G    mg kg  or SSD   G    mg kg SSDs were given from GD  – 
Each group of rats was treated with either vehicle or SSD  or SSD

Cage side observations for clinical signs of toxicity in the animals were recorded once daily until the day before necropsy •Body weight  Body weight of all experimental animals were recorded once before mating  initial body weight  and then after confirmation of mating 
Body weights were recorded on days               and on terminal day before sacrifice 
These recorded body weights were used for calculating the dose volume to be administered •Food consumption  Food consumption was evaluated once after successful mating or on day   of gestation  the day of vaginal plug formation or sperms observed in vaginal smear  and on days             and one day prior to sacrifice 
Calculated amount of feed were placed in the trough of each cage and the quantity of feed remaining after approximately   h were weighed and recorded •Morbidity Mortality  All the animals were observed twice daily  once in the morning between   and   h and once in the evening between   and   h  for incidence of morbidity and or mortality •Maternal examination related parameters  At the end of the observation period  all the dams were sequentially euthanized  by CO  asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation  and subjected to gross necropsy 
After termination  dams were examined macroscopically for any structural abnormalities or pathological changes 
Blinding was done while evaluation of the dams during caesarean section and subsequent foetal analyses to minimize bias 
Pregnancy rate was calculated as the proportion of mated pairs that had produced at least one pregnancy within a fixed period where pregnancy was determined by the earliest available evidence that fertilization has occurred 
Gestation index was calculated to indicate number of females with live born as a proportion of number of females with evidence of pregnancy •Examination of uterine contents  Immediately after termination  the uteri were removed and the pregnancy status of the animals ascertained 
Gravid uteri including the cervix were weighed  and number of corpora lutea were determined 
The uterine contents were examined for numbers of embryonic or foetal deaths and live foetuses 
The degree of resorption was described in order to estimate the relative time of death of the conceptus 
Any increase in the number of resorption and or implantation loss is an indicator of litter size for the individual dam •Examination of foetuses  The sex and weight of each foetus were determined 
Approximately one half of each litter were prepared and examined for skeletal alterations from selected dams 
The remainder were prepared and examined for soft tissue alterations  using accepted or appropriate serial sectioning methods or careful gross dissection techniques 
Each foetus was examined for external alterations 
Foetuses were examined for skeletal alterations  using Alizarin Red S staining method 
The fetuses for skeletal staining were kept in pre labelled plastic containers containing   ethanol before staining 
After skinning  we processed the foetus for staining by immersing in   alcian blue   GX for three days  then performed rehydration through a gradient series of ethanol   ethanol   –  h twice    ethanol   –  h  ethanol   –  h  distilled water until the samples sank to the bottom of a conical tube 
Samples were further treated with   KOH for  –  days or until it became clear and again treated with   alizarin red for next  –  days until bones became purple 
Samples were rinsed   times in   KOH  for  –  h at each time point 
Samples were further treated with a gradient series of glycerol  KOH    h   glycerol   h X  Visceral examination was done by micro dissection technique 
Fetuses were preserved in   formalin until they became fixed 
An illuminated magnifier was used for visceral examination 
We placed the foetus in a supine position on a paraffin wax block tray covered with paraffin wax  secured the fetal limbs by paper pins to the paraffin wax block  made a ventral midline incision from the umbilicus  cutting caudally to the genital tubercle and cranially to the diaphragm 
Once incision was completed  we located the ventral attachment of the diaphragm and lifted the liver carefully to examine the diaphragm for abnormal opening 
After observation  the diaphragm was clipped 
We gave a longitudinal cut to open the rib cage slightly lateral to and on the right of the sternebrae and then extended the cut anteriorly to neck region 
The rib cage was opened gently and secured to the paraffin block petridish tray with pins Foetuses were examined for soft tissue alterations  e g 
variations and malformations or anomalies  using Wilson s Technique 
The fetal viscera were examined sequentially  beginning with thoracic organs and moving caudally 
We performed hearts cuts after completion of other observations 
We examined the bilobed thymus for size  shape  coloration and presence of haemorrhages and then removed it for observation of trachea and esophagus 
We observed the lungs for size  color and number of lobes  observed the trachea  esophagus for normal alignment and presence of fistula  opened the pericardial sac and cut off pericardium to expose the heart for observation 
We checked the size  shape  color of the heart and normal development of major blood vessels 
After observation of thoracic viscera  we observed the abdominal viscera and liver for size  shape  color  texture  and number of lobes 
External anatomy of heart was examined by making two incisions using micro dissecting scissors We examined the stomach  spleen  pancreas  small and large intestines for size  position or any other developmental anomalies 
The intestines were moved aside after observation for seeing the underlying structures 
Ureters were checked for normal size and location and for continuity from the renal hilus to the urinary bladder 
One kidney was cut transversely and another was longitudinally to examine renal papilla and renal pelvis 
To confirm the sex of the foetus  the gonads were inspected carefully 
We examined the reproductive organs for size  shape and location GraphPad Prism® statistical software version   was used to analyze the data and all the results were represented as mean   S E M 
Intergroup variance for most of the parameters was calculated by one way analysis of variance  ANOVA  followed by Tukey s test 
A value of p     was regarded statistically significant 
Linear regression was performed to examine the weight change of dams during pregnancy for each group comparing with the control after adjusting for the litter size 
The malformations were analysed by performing Chi square test for trend for two groups  SSD  G  G  G  G  and SSD  G  G  G  G The ARRIVE guidelines were followed to report the findings 
In phase   pre natal study  all the dams dosed with SSD  and SSD  had normal food intake and weight gain 
The average gain in weight from GD  to GD   was       gms for controls while it was       gms in SSD   and       gms in SSD 
 Webtable  
No test item related mortality or clinical sign of toxicity was encountered during the study 
All dams in treatment groups and control group survived to scheduled terminal sacrifice 
They showed normal behaviour until euthanized 
There were no differences in mean maternal body weights  body weight gains  pregnancy rate  gestational index  pre and post implantation loss  and resorptions 
No significant differences were observed in foetal sex ratio  foetal body weights 
However  one dam from SSD  had all male foetuses 
No abnormality was detected in skeletal and visceral examination In phase   controls and SSD  and SSD  treated dams exhibited a comparable food intake  Table  
 
However  a dose response relationship was observed with reduced weight gain with higher doses of SSDs 
 Table  
 
Two dams  one in G   SSD    mg kg  and the other in G   SSD    mg kg  categories showed decreased or consistent body weight GD  onwards 
On an average  the weight on GD   was       gms in controls while it was       with SSD    mg kg  and       gms with SSD    mg kg 
The adjusted analysis indicated that except in G  there was a significant reduction in weight gain in all the intervention groups as compared to the control group after controlling for litter size  Table  
 During follow up  one dam from SSD    mg kg  and one from SSD    mg kg  showed haematuria during gestational day  – 
However  no another clinical sign of toxicity was encountered during the study 
All the dams in treatment and control groups showed normal behaviour and survived to scheduled terminal sacrifice 
In phase   pregnancy rate and gestational index were found to be   at all dose levels with SSD  whereas  in SSD  it decreased to   in G   SSD    mg kg  and G   SSD    mg kg  groups 
One dam from G   SSD    mg kg  and another one from G   SSD    mg kg  group showed mating confirmation during vaginal smear examination and showed positive sign in initial days of pregnancy but during necropsy on expected day of delivery  GD   no foetus was found 
Body weights of dams increased in the initial stages that became constant at a later period 
To reconfirm it  non gravid uterus was stained in salewski strain and presence of conceptus was found 
This indicated the possibility of miscarriage Increased pre and post implantation losses as well as resorptions and reduced live foetuses were observed with both SSD  and SSD 
No significant differences were observed in foetal sex ratio  but decreased foetal body weights were noted in both sexes 
On an average one early resorption in a group was a normal observation 
More than one late resorption was observed in all treatment groups while there was none in the control group 
Total count of live foetuses count was significantly reduced with SSD  and SSD  treatment in a dose dependent manner 
Total number of live foetuses were reduced up to   in SSD  at   mg kg treatment group and   in SSD  at   mg kg treatment group Both SSD  and SSD s at different dose levels showed decreased fetal weight in dose dependent manner  although the difference was not significant 
Skeletal and soft tissue alterations were observed in both treatment groups 
In general  the embryo–foetal examination showed abnormalities  which could have caused some functional damage to these foetuses if allowed to grow in the normal course 
In visceral examinations  slight dilation of the renal pelvis  reduced papilla size  urinary bladder hypertrophy was observed in few foetuses from both SSD  and SSD  treatment groups 
Few incidences of foetal soft tissue abnormalities encountered in this study were normal variants 
Skeletal examination showed variations in the ossification patterns like incomplete or poorly ossified skulls  ossification of sternebra  cleavage ossification of thoracic centrum  asymmetric thoracic centrum  and supernumerary rib in many foetuses in SSD  and SSD  groups  Table  
 
A trend was noted with increased incidence of certain malformations with increasing dosages of SSDs that was statistically significant for most malformations with SSD The results of this developmental toxicity study suggest that administration of SSDs to pregnant rats had significant impact on intrauterine foetal growth  early and late resorption as well as developmental anomalies 
These formulations have teratogenic potential but does not affect sex ratio IPs contain phytoestrogens like diadzein and genistein  In vitro rat whole embryo culture assay  WEC  studies of genistein in rats have indicated fetotoxic and teratogenic potential at concentration of ≥  μg mL  However  in vivo  an oral  gavage  embryonic and fetal development pilot study could not demonstrate any teratogenic effect in the same study 
These findings are different from our study probably because we used SSDs containing natural herbal and non herbal ingredients unlike those studies where synthetic genistein was used 
In both the studies  decreased body weight was observed indicating slight maternal toxicity 
Food consumption was unaffected in our study which is contrary to what was reported 
In another study  pregnant rats exposed to oral isoflavones  diadzein and genistein in varying combinations  showed alterations in the number of live foetuses  lysed foetuses  number of resorption sites  and implantation sites while no clinical signs suggestive of maternal toxicity  seizures  tremors and salivation  that was observed similar to our study 
Maternal mass gain was significantly reduced in rats treated with   mg kg of isoflavones  Ratio of females to males in the litter of different groups was similar akin to our finding  These observations clearly nullify the claim that consumption of SDDs could alter the sex of the growing foetus 
An analysis done by the same authors earlier revealed that SSDs contain testosterone and steroids 
 
  The prenatal testosterone in pregnancy is known to affect sexual development adversely      The principles of reproductive biology state that the genetic sex of an individual is determined at the time of conception and can never be altered under any circumstances 
However  phenotypic sex of the growing foetus is likely to be influenced by the hormonal milieu of in utero environment 
Our analysis was confined to phenotypic sex only and hence it is difficult to state if any differences existed with reference to genetic and phenotypic sex 
This requires further inquiry Evidence on the effects of SSDs on humans should best be obtained from human beings 
The findings of the current study corroborate well with the evidence generated from observational studies in human beings      Presence of skeletal and visceral malformations could explain why stillbirths are likely to be more in women who consume SSDs 
The dosing of the test drugs was intended not only to examine the period of organogenesis solely but to assess effects from preimplantation  through the entire period of gestation to the day before caesarean section 
The results were based on observations of more than   female animals with implantation sites at necropsy that added to its strength 
Unnecessary handling of pregnant animals as well as any stressors from outside was avoided 
At least three dose levels and a concurrent vehicle control were used with dams randomly allocated to different treatment groups that support the validity of the results 
However  absence of   rats per group does not support it to be a fully OECD compliant study 
We did follow the principles of Good Laboratory Practices  GLP  but due to constraints of resources the study could not be conducted as a GLP compliant study  though this is optimal for academic interests There is a lack of systematic approach to assess the safety and effectiveness of herbal preparations 
Ingredients for herbal medicines are often drawn from different sources and are used in combination  which may exhibit variability in terms of species  growing conditions  and biologically active constituents 
To isolate each active ingredient from each herb and then to establish its toxicity is time consuming  resource intensive and not practical 
Moreover  drug approval process does not accommodate undifferentiated mixtures  Though important  it surpasses the herb herb interaction and the potentiating effect of one compound over another 
Therefore  in our study  we administered the herbal mixture to assess the effects 
Real time evaluations have yielded important observations for several herbal drugs especially related to pregnancy 
For instance  Wang et al 
  used mice model to evaluate the adverse pregnancy outcomes after maternal exposure to the herbal medicines  particularly during early pregnancy  The major events included maternal and perinatal mortality 
Maternal weight gain  embryo growth and post natal weight gain were significantly decreased 
Moreover  foetal resorption and skeletal malformations were increased  signifying potential toxicity of Chinese herbal medicines 
This is comparable to our findings To conclude  the results of this developmental toxicity study suggest that administration of SSD  and SSD  to pregnant rats exerted significant impact on intrauterine foetal growth and development without any effect on sex ratio when administered during the period of organogenesis 
The prenatal exposure of SSD  and SSD  at dosage level of   mg kg day and   mg kg day during gestational days  –  to female rats had demonstrable effect on maternal or embryo foetal toxicity and teratogenicity SBN and AG conceptualized the study  AS and DD developed the study protocol and conducted the experiment  analysed the data and interpreted the findings

Recombination events have been demonstrated to be associated with viruses expanding their host range   or increasing their virulence    thus accompanying  or perhaps even being at the origin of  major changes during virus adaptation 
It remains unclear  however  whether recombination events represent a highly frequent and significant phenomenon in the everyday life of these viruses Viruses can exchange genetic material when at least two different viral genomes co infect the same host cell 
Progeny can then become hybrid through different mechanisms  such as reassortment of segments when the parental genomes are fragmented    intra molecular recombination when polymerases switch templates  in RNA viruses     or homologous or non homologous recombination  in both RNA and DNA viruses 
Quantification of viral recombination in multi cellular organisms has been attempted under two distinct experimental approaches  in vitro  in cell cultures     and in vivo  in live hosts    
The in vitro approach  which has so far been applied only to animal viruses  allows the establishment of the  intrinsic  recombination rate in experimentally co infected cells in cell cultures   
However  it does not necessarily reflect the situation in entire  living hosts  where the frequency of co infected cells is poorly known and depends on many factors such as the size of the pathogen population  the relative frequency and distribution of the different variants  and host defense mechanisms preventing secondary infection of cells 
The in vivo experimental approach is closer to biological conditions and may thus be more informative of what actually happens in  the real world However  as discussed below  numerous experimental constraints have so far precluded an actual quantification of the baseline rate of recombination 
First  many experimental designs have used extreme positive selection  where only recombinant genomes were viable  e g    
Other studies did not use complementation techniques but detected recombinants by PCR within infected hosts or tissues    which provides information on their presence but not on their frequency in the viral population 
So far  no quantitative PCR or other quantitative method has been applied to evaluate the number of recombinants appearing in an experimentally infected live host 
Finally  recent methods based on sequence analysis inferred the population recombination rate  rather than the individual recombination rate   
While results from these methods certainly take in vivo recombination into account  there are other caveats  isolates have often been collected in different hosts sometimes in different geographical regions and sometimes the selective neutrality of sequence variation on which these estimates are based is not clearly established 
Estimates from such studies by essence address the estimation of the recombination rate at a different evolutionary scale Taken together  the currently available information indicates that no viral recombination rate has ever been estimated directly at time and space scales corresponding to a single multi cellular host infection  although this level is most significant for the biology and evolution of viruses 
This study intends to fill this gap by evaluating the recombination frequency of the cauliflower mosaic virus  CaMV  during a single passage in one of its host plants  the turnip Brassica rapa CaMV is a pararetrovirus  which is a major grouping containing hepadnaviruses  e g  hepatitis B virus  badnaviruses  e g  banana streak virus  and caulimoviruses  e g  CaMV 
Pararetroviruses are characterized by a non segmented double stranded DNA genome 
After entering the host cell nucleus  the viral DNA accumulates as a minichromosome   whose transcription is ensured by the host RNA polymerase II   
The CaMV genome consists in approximately   bp and encodes six viral gene products that have been detected in planta  Figure     
Viral proteins P  to P  are expressed from two major transcripts  namely a  S RNA  encoding P  and a  S RNA corresponding to the entire genome and serving as mRNA for proteins P –P    
Using the pre genomic  S RNA as a matrix  the protein P   product of gene V  reverse transcribes the genome into genomic DNA that is concomitantly encapsidated   The detection of CaMV recombinants in turnip hosts has been reported numerous times 
Some studies have demonstrated the appearance of infectious recombinant viral genomes after inoculation  i  of a host plant with two infectious or non infectious parental clones   or  ii  of a transgenic plant containing one CaMV transgene with a CaMV genome missing the corresponding genomic region   
While the former revealed inter genomic viral recombination  the latter demonstrated that CaMV can also recombine with transgenes within the host s genome 
Another study based on phylogenetic analyses of various CaMV strains has clearly suggested different origins for different genomic regions and  hence  multiple recombination events during the evolution of this virus   
Indirect experimental evidence has indicated that  in some cases  CaMV recombination could occur within the host nucleus  between different viral minichromosomes  presumably through the action of the DNA repair cellular machinery   
Nevertheless  the mechanism of  template switching  during reverse transcription  predominant in all retroviruses  most certainly also applies to pararetroviruses 
For this reason  and on the basis of numerous experimental data  CaMV is generally believed to recombine mostly in the cytoplasm of the host cell  by  legal  template switching between two pre genomic RNA molecules    or  illegal  template switching between the  S and the  S RNA   
Under this hypothesis  recombination in CaMV could therefore be considered as operating on a linear template during reverse transcription  with the  ′ and  ′ extremities later ligated to circularize the genomic DNA  position   in Figure  
The above cited studies clearly demonstrate that CaMV is able to recombine 
However  since these studies are based on complementation techniques  non quantitative detection  or phylogenetically based inferences of recombination  they do not inform us on whether recombination is an exceptional event or an  everyday  process shaping the genetic composition of CaMV populations In the present work  we aimed at answering this question 
To this end  we have constructed a CaMV genome with four genetic markers  demonstrated to be neutral in competition experiments 
By co inoculating host plants with equal amounts of wild type and marker containing CaMV particles  we have generated mixed populations in which impressive proportions of recombinants distributed in several different classes corresponding to exchange of different genomic regions have been detected and quantified 
Altogether  the recombinant genomes averaged over   of the population 
Further analysis of these data  assuming a number of viral replications during the infection period ranging from five to   indicates that the per nucleotide per replication cycle recombination rate of CaMV is of the same order of magnitude  i e  on the order of a few   across the entire genome 
We thereby provide the first quantification  to our knowledge  of the recombination rate in a virus population during a single passage in a single host From Figure   and supposing that all marker containing genomic regions can recombine  we could predict the detection and quantification of seven classes of recombinant genotypes   bcd a  a cd b  ab d c  abc d   cd ab  a d bc  and a c b d 
Indeed  all classes were detected  and their frequencies in the ten CaMV populations analyzed are summarized in Table  Altogether  the proportion of recombinant genomes found in the mixed viral populations was astonishingly high and very similar in the ten co infected plants analyzed  Table   last column  ranging between    plant   to    plants     and   with a mean frequency   standard error  of      
This result indicates that recombination events are very frequent during the invasion of the host plant by CaMV and represents  to our knowledge  the first direct quantification of viral recombination during the infection of a live multi cellular host The inferred per generation recombination and interference rates  assuming that CaMV undergoes ten replication cycles during the   d between infection and sampling  are given for each of the ten plants in Table  
Recombination rates between adjacent markers are large  on the order of   to  
Taking the distance in nucleotides between markers into account yields an average recombination rate per nucleotide and generation on the order of      
Interestingly  this recombination rate does not vary throughout the genome  Kruskal–Wallis test  p    To relax the assumption of the number of replications during the   d  we calculated the recombination parameters assuming five or   generations 
The effect of the number of generations on the estimates is linear  doubling the number of generations results in a halving of the recombination rate  detailed results not shown 
For example  the average recombination rates r
  r
  and r
  assuming   generations were equal to     and   respectively  compare with values in Table   yielding per nucleotide per generation recombination rates of             and      Inspection of Table   also shows that first order interference coefficients were in general negative  indicating that a crossing over in one genomic segment increases the probability that a crossing over will occur in another genomic segment  while the second order coefficient parameter had an average value close to zero with a large variance 
The mechanism leading to these results will be discussed in the following section One major breakthrough in the work presented here lies in the space and time scales at which the experiments were performed 
Indeed  the processes occurring within the course of a single infection of one multi cellular host are of obvious biological relevance for any disease 
Previous studies on viral recombination suffered from major drawbacks in this respect  basing their conclusions on experiments relying on complementation among non infectious viruses or between viruses with undetermined relative fitness  on phylogenetically based analyses  or on experiments in cell cultures 
For reasons detailed in the Introduction  the first two methods either do not provide information on the frequency of recombination  but only its occurrence  or address the question at a different temporal  and often spatial  scale 
Results from cell cultures  on the other hand  impose cell co infection by different viral variants  potentially overestimating the frequency of recombination events 
Our study circumvents these limitations by analyzing viral genotypes sampled from infected plants after the course of a single infection  and therefore the invasion and co infection of cells in various organs and tissues is very close to natural More than half of the genomes       see Table   present in a CaMV population after a single passage in its host plant were identified as recombinants  and these data allowed us to infer a per nucleotide per generation recombination rate on the order of       to      
The time length of one generation  i e  the time required for a given genome to go from one replication to the next  is totally unknown in plant viruses 
The only experimental data available on CaMV are based on the kinetics of gene expression in infected protoplasts  where the capsid protein is produced between   and   h   
The reverse transcription and the encapsidation of genomic DNA being two coupled phenomena    we judged it reasonable to assume a generation time of   d and  thus  an average of ten generations during our experiments 
In case this estimate is mistaken  we have verified a linear relationship between r and the number of generations  thereby allowing an immediate adjustment of r if the CaMV generation time is more precisely established 
At this point  we must consider that all cloned genomes may not have been through all the successive replication events potentially allowed by the timing of our experiments 
It was previously shown that about   of CaMV mature virus particles accumulate in compact inclusion bodies    where they may be sequestered for a long time  as such inclusions are very frequent in all infected cells  including those in leaves that have been invaded by the virus population for several weeks 
The viral population may thus present an age structure that could bias the estimation of the recombination rate 
In order to minimize this bias  the clones we analyzed were collected in one young newly formed leaf  where the chances of finding genomes from  unsequestered lines  were assumed to be higher 
In any case  our data analysis is conservative  since this age structure can only lead to an underestimation of the recombination rate Our results show that interferences between pairs of loci are negative  a recombination event between two loci apparently increases the probability of recombination between another pair of loci 
We believe that the most parsimonious explanation of these negative interferences is based on the way the infection builds up within plant hosts 
Indeed  one can divide infected host cells into those infected by a single virus genotype and those infected by more than one viral genotype 
In the former  analogous to clonal propagation  recombination is undetectable 
In the latter  recombination is not only detectable but  as our results indicate  very frequent 
Samples consisting of viruses resulting from a mixture of these two types of host cell infections will thus contain viruses with no recombination and viruses with several recombination events  thus yielding an impression of negative interference 
These conceptual arguments are supported by mathematical models 
It is indeed easy to show  detailed results not shown  that if a proportion F of the population reproduces clonally  analogous to single infections  while the remaining reproduces panmictically  negative interferences could be inferred even if they do not exist 
For example  assuming a three locus model with real recombination rates r
  and r
  and interference i
  the  apparent  recombination and interference parameters  would be r
        F r  r
        F r
  and i
     F   i
    F 
Interestingly  this example also shows that our estimates of the recombination rate are conservative  that a fraction F of host cells are singly infected while others are multiply infected leads to an underestimation of the recombination rate As judged by r
  r
  and r
  calculated between markers a–b  b–c  and c–d  respectively  we found evidence for recombination through the entire CaMV genome 
The values for r
 
r
  and r
  are remarkably similar  hence the recombination sites seem to be evenly distributed along the genome 
We considered the template switching model as the major way recombinants are created in CaMV 
As already mentioned in the Introduction  hot spots of template switching have been predicted at the position of the  ′ extremities of the  S and  S RNAs   
If other recombination mechanisms  such as that associated with second strand DNA synthesis or with the host cell DNA repair machinery  act significantly  hot spots would be expected at the positions of the sequence interruption     and     
Due to the design of our experiment and the position of the four markers  we have no information on putative hot spots at positions corresponding to the  ′ end of the  S RNA and to    at nucleotide position  
Nevertheless  the putative hot spots at the  ′ end of the  S RNA and at   and    nucleotide positions   and   respectively  fall between marker pairs c–d  b–c  and a–b  respectively 
Our results indicate that either these hot spots are quantitatively equivalent though predicted by different recombination mechanisms or  more likely  that they simply do not exist 
Whatever the explanation  what we observe is that the CaMV can exchange any portion of its genome  and thus any gene thereof  with an astonishingly high frequency during the course of a single host infection To our knowledge  the viral recombination rate has never previously been quantified experimentally for a plant virus   
In contrast  retroviruses and particularly HIV  have been extensively investigated in that sense 
As we have already discussed for these latter cases  the quantification of the intrinsic recombination rate was carried out in artificially co infected cell cultures 
The estimated intrinsic per nucleotide per generation recombination rate in HIV  is on the order of      less than one order of magnitude higher than our estimation for CaMV 
Because for various reasons detailed above we probably underestimate the within host CaMV recombination rate  we believe that the intrinsic recombination rate in CaMV is higher and perhaps on the order of that of HIV Other pararetroviruses such as plant badnaviruses or vertebrate hepadnaviruses have a similar cycle within their host cells  including steps of nuclear minichromosome  genomic size RNA synthesis  and reverse transcription and encapsidation 
Nevertheless  vertebrate hepadnaviruses  e g  hepatitis B virus  infect hosts that are very different from plants in their biology and physiology  and this could lead to a totally different frequency of cell co infection during the development of the virus populations 
Thus  even though our results can be informative for other pararetroviruses because of the viruses  shared biological characteristics  they should not be extrapolated to vertebrate pararetroviruses without caution We used the plasmid pCa  which is the complete genome of the CaMV isolate Cabb S  cloned into the pBR  plasmid at the unique SalI restriction site   
To analyze recombination in different regions of the genome  we introduced four genetic markers  a  b  c  and d  at the positions       and   respectively  thus approximately at four cardinal points of the CaMV circular double stranded DNA of   bp  Figure  
All markers  each corresponding to a single nucleotide change  were introduced by PCR directed mutagenesis in pCa  and resulted in the duplication of previously unique restriction sites BsiWI  PstI  MluI  and SacI in a plasmid designated pMark S  Because  in this study  we targeted the possible exchange of genes between viral genomes  all markers a  b  c  and d were introduced within coding regions corresponding to open reading frames I  IV  V  and VI  respectively 
Another important concern was to quantify recombination in the absence of selection  i e  to create neutral markers 
Consequently all markers consist of synonymous mutations  see below To generate the parental virus particles  plasmids pCa  and pMark S were mechanically inoculated into individual plants as previously described   
All plants were turnips  B  rapa cv   Just Right  grown under glasshouse conditions at   °C with a    light dark  photoperiod 
Thirty days post inoculation  all symptomatic leaves were harvested and viral particles were purified as described earlier   The resulting preparations of parental viruses  designated Cabb S and Mark S  were quantified by spectrometry using the formula described by Hull et al 
  
We fixed the initial frequency of markers to a value of   and a solution containing   mg ml of virus particles of both Cabb S and Mark S at a   ratio was prepared 
Plantlets were co infected by mechanical inoculation of two to three leaves with   μl of this virus solution  using abrasive Celite AFA  Fluka  Ronkonkoma  New York  United States 
The mixed CaMV population was allowed to grow during   d of systemic infection We designed an experimental protocol for quantifying marker frequency within a mixed Cabb S Mark S virus population after a single passage in a host plant 
Twenty four individual plants  inoculated as above with equal amounts of Cabb S and Mark S  were harvested   d post inoculation  when symptoms were fully developed 
The viral DNA was purified from   mg of young newly formed infected leaves according to the protocol described previously   
After the precipitation step of this protocol  the viral DNA was resuspended and further purified with the Wizard DNA clean up kit  Promega  Fitchburg  Wisconsin  United States  in TE  X   mM Tris HCl and   mM EDTA  pH   
Aliquots of viral DNA preparations were digested by restriction enzymes corresponding either to marker a  b  c  or d and submitted to a   agarose gel electrophoresis  colored by ethydium bromide and exposed to UV 
Each individual restriction enzyme cut once in Cabb S DNA and twice in Mark S  thus generating DNA fragments of different sizes attributable to one or the other in the mixed population of CaMV genomes 
After scanning the agarose gels  we estimated the relative frequency of the two genotypes in each viral DNA preparation and at each marker position  by densitometry using the NIH   Image program 
The statistical analyses of the frequency of the four markers are described below To identify and quantify the recombinants within the CaMV mixed populations  aliquots from ten of the   viral DNA preparations described above were digested by the restriction enzyme SalI  and directly cloned into pUC  at the corresponding site 
In each of the ten viral populations analyzed    full genome length clones were digested separately by BsiWI  PstI  MluI  and SacI  to test for the presence of marker a  b  c  and d  respectively 
In this experiment  with the marker representing an additional restriction site  we could easily distinguish between the Cabb S and the Mark S genotype at all four marker positions  upon agarose gel   electrophoresis of the digested clones 
Clones with none or all four markers were parental genotypes  whereas clones harboring     or   markers were clearly recombinants 
Due to the very high number of recombinants detected  markers eventually appearing or disappearing due to spontaneous mutations were neglected Here we present the different methods we used to quantify recombination in the CaMV genome 
Because all these methods assume that the different markers are neutral  we first discuss assumption We used two datasets to test the neutrality of markers  both resulting from plants co infected with a   ratio of Mark S and Cabb S 
The first consisted of viral DNA densitometry data derived from   plants  described above  where for each plant we have an estimate of the frequency of each marker in the genome population 
The second consisted of the restriction of   individual full genome length viral clones obtained from one co infected plant  described above  yielding an estimate of the frequency of each marker  and this was repeated on ten different plants 
The frequencies of the different markers were       and   for markers a  b  c  and d in the first dataset and       and   in the second dataset 
We tested whether these frequencies were significantly different from the expected value under neutrality    using either t tests  for datasets where normality could not be rejected  seven out of eight cases  or Wilcoxon signed rank non parametric tests otherwise  marker c in the first dataset 
In all cases p values were larger than  There are several cautionary remarks regarding these analyses 
First  in all cases we found an excess of markers 
Unfortunately  the two datasets cannot be regarded as independent because  even though the methods through which the frequency estimates were obtained were different  the plants used in the second dataset were a subset of the plants of the first 
We thus have only four independent estimates in each case  and there is minimal power to detect significant deviations from neutrality with such a small sample size 
It should be noted at this stage that deviations from the expected value could also be caused either by slight deviations from the   ratio in the infecting mixed solution  or by deviations from that ratio in the frequency of the viral particles that actually get into the plants 
Second  because of the relatively small sample sizes and low statistical power  the tests presented above could have detected only large deviations The results clearly show  however  precisely that the markers do not have large effects  if any  and that therefore recombination estimates would be affected only very slightly by any hypothetical selective effects of the markers 
Because of this  along with the fact that the introduced markers provoke silent substitutions in the CaMV genome  we assumed that markers were effectively neutral in the rest of the analysis The dataset used to estimate the recombination frequency consisted of the   full genome length viral clones   from each of ten co infected plants  individually genotyped for each of the four markers 
As discussed in detail in the Results  recombination was very frequent and concerned all four markers 
Indeed  approximately half of the genotyped clones exhibited a recombinant genotype 
It was therefore meaningful to try to obtain quantitative estimates of recombination from our data Our aim was to analyze viral recombination in a live host 
Consequently  we had to deal with the fact that more than one viral replication cycle occurred during the   d that infection lasted in our experiment  we had to wait that long for the disease to develop and to be able to recover sufficient amounts of viral DNA from each infection 
Based on the kinetics of gene expression    we postulate that each replication cycle lasts between   and   d  and that therefore seven to ten cycles occurred between infection and the sampling time 
In case this assumption is incorrect  we did calculations assuming five  seven  ten  or   replication cycles during these   d  As shown  the results were not affected qualitatively  and only slightly quantitatively 
It is important to note that we assumed that recombination occurred through a template switching mechanism  and that therefore  from a recombination point of view  the CaMV genome is linear 
The reverse transcription starts and finishes at the position   in Figure   which is the point of circularization of the DNA genome 
This implies that changes between contiguous markers a–b  b–c  and c–d can be considered as true recombination whereas those between a and d cannot  as they may simply stem from circularization of DNA  during the synthesis of which the polymerase has switched template once anywhere between a–b  b–c  or c–d To estimate the recombination rate between markers  we wrote recurrence equations describing the change in frequency of each genotype over one generation  assuming random mating and no selection  i e  the standard Wright–Fisher population genetics model 
We then expressed the frequency of all possible genotypes n generations later as a function of their initial frequency and of the recombination parameters 
Subsequently we calculated the maximum likelihood estimates of the recombination parameters and their asymptotic variances given initial frequencies  we assumed that the two  parental  genotypes  Mark S and Cabb S  had equal initial frequencies of   and that all other genotypes had initial frequencies of zero  and frequencies after n generations  the observed frequencies  as stated above we used different values of n 
All algebraic and numerical calculations were carried out with the software Mathematica The recombination parameters are the recombination rates between two adjacent loci  e g  r
  for the recombination rate between markers a and b  and the interference coefficients  e g  i
  for interference between recombination events in the segments between markers a and b and b and c  To define these parameters we followed Christiansen    and in particular the recombination distributions for two  three  and four loci  respectively  Tables     and   of   
It is important to realize that given the definitions of these parameters  the estimator of the recombination rate between two loci is not affected by the number of loci considered 
In other words  we obtain the same estimation of the recombination rate between markers a and b whether we consider genotypic frequencies at just these two loci  or the frequencies at these two loci plus a third locus  or the complete information to which we have access  the four marker genotypes 
Information on additional loci only affects the estimates of the interference coefficients It proved impossible to carry out the calculations for four loci algebraically 
Instead  we used a computer program to calculate the expected genotypic frequencies at all four loci after n generations  given the above stated initial frequencies and specified recombination parameters 
For each combination of recombination parameters we calculated a Euclidean distance between the vector of the expected genotypic frequencies and the observed genotypic frequencies  and considered that the estimated recombination parameters were those yielding the minimal Euclidean distance 
In all cases  the estimated recombination rates between pairs of loci were equal to the second decimal to those estimated algebraically from data for three or two loci Tumor Restrictions to Oncolytic VirusIn most solid tumors the tumor interior displays a high cellular density with multiple cell types  both malignant and normal  stromal  cells  interdigitated by strands of extracellular matrix  ECM  and other poorly defined tissue 
Stromal cells typically consist of fibroblasts  macrophages  neutrophils and other immune cell types 
Tumor associated fibroblasts are a source of the bulk acellular tissue in tumors    which is largely made up of polysugars and glycoproteins  such as collagens  laminins  fibronectins  proteoglycans  hyaluronan and water  forming a dense matrix around and between the cancer cells   
This matrix provides structural support but also haptotactic and chemotactic guidance for cancer cells   
Moreover  the prevailing tumor interstitium is rich in soluble angiogenic factors  such as members of the vascular endothelial growth factor  VEGF  family    cellular growth factors  including endothelial growth factor  EGF  basic fibroblast growth factor  FGF  platelet derived growth factor  PDGF  and pleiotrophic factors  particularly transforming growth factor  TGF  beta   
Additionally  both tumor  and stromal cells secrete cytokines and chemokines  such as interleukin  IL    IL   tumor necrosis factor  TNF  alpha  stromal cell derived factor  SDF    macrophage migration inhibitory factor  MIF    which on one hand recruit more stromal and progenitor cells into the tumors and on the other hand curb the activity of antigen presenting cells and anti tumor T cells   
In several independent cancer types  high serum levels of IL   and IL   are indicators of poor prognosis   Aberrant tumor and stromal growth combined with an overproduction of matrix leads to high interstitial pressure in the tumor  preventing lateral diffusion of therapeutic compounds within the tumor 
Tight cellular compactness combined with a high tumor proliferation rate also causes physical crowding and puts constraints on oxygenation  which due to aberrant angiogenesis and rupture of the haphazard vessels is mostly incomplete and results in chronic tissue hypoxia toward the tumor cores 
As cancer cells exist in a crowding hypoxic  and cytokine growth factor perpetuated chronic state of stress  they upregulate a number of key cellular molecules that function as a collective defense against a wide range of therapies  including oncolytic viruses 
The properties of oncolytic viruses and their status in clinical development as well as various delivery options have been reviewed elsewhere   
In this review  we provide an overview of two of the main intratumoral barriers to oncolytic virus spread  the extracellular tumor make up and the intracellular antiviral defense mechanisms Tumor cellular structure and composition may in concert with abundant extracellular matrix  ECM  deposition pose a severe hurdle for systemic virus entry and propagation of infection within the tumor 
The extracellular matrix is a complex dense network consisting of multiple proteins  glycoproteins and polysaccharides including collagens  laminins  fibronectins  proteoglycans and hyaluronic acid   
The interstitial fluid pressure  IFP  in the tumor surrounding blood and lymphatic vessels is mainly created by the high cell density that forms an increased physical pressure outwards and does not allow free diffusion of therapeutics   
A high IFP generally predicts an aggressive tumor phenotype as tumor cells tend to escape from tumor margins where the pressure drops  thus facilitating spread of metastatic cells   
On the other hand  for therapeutic virus  interstitial fluid concentration gradients may pose a hurdle as passive diffusion in viable regions  typically the rim  may occur mainly outward   
Given the limited arsenal of known chemicals alleviating tumor compactness and the poor penetration drugs in general into the tumor tissue  this is a considerable problem that may not be easy to tackle 
Some strategies are discussed below Viruses are passive particles and rely either on radial cell to cell spread or on soluble diffusion across concentration gradients to reach their target cells and to propagate the infection 
Tumor matrix is critical in this regard  as it can block both forms of spread 
Passively diffusing viruses may physically not fit through the strands of the ECM 
This was shown for oncolytic herpes virus  which has an outer diameter of over   nm  and whose spreading could be improved by matrix degrading bacterial collagenase co injection   
Bilbao and coworkers showed that adenovirus entry into experimental hepatocellular carcinoma nodules in the livers of immunocompetent rats following intravenous or intraportal injection was directly related to the thickness of the ECM capsule enveloping the nodules   
On the other hand  we found using Semliki Forest virus  which has an outer diameter of about   nm  that even upon intratumoral injection spread was blocked by ECM  which formed a physical barrier for virus infection  Figure  The foremost option to reduce interstitial fluid pressure and to remove physical molecule barriers imposed by the ECM is to use matrix degrading enzymes 
These act by digesting collagen  fibrin  and other types of fibrillar matrix deposits  creating more space between cell clusters  and glycosaminoglycan polymers  known to limit fluid movement in tumors 
Simultaneously  such strategies may also expose more cell surface to viruses  increasing the likelihood of infection 
In a study by Kuriyama  trypsin or collagenase dispase was injected into subcutaneous U  and U  glioma xenografts in immunocompromised mice  followed by a reporter adenovirus   
Both types of ECM degrading enzymes increased tumor transduction by the virus  but when doses got too high  transduction efficacy suffered  demonstrating a balance between ECM degradation and oncolytic virus efficacy 
In another study  treatment of PC  tumors with vaccinia virus producing matrix metalloprotease  MMP    resulted in reduction of collagen IV fibrils and increase in virus penetration into tumor  which yielded elevated virus titers   
Hong et al 
targeted orthotopic neuroblastoma xenografts engineered to express MMP  with oncolytic HSV  achieving increased virus distribution compared to control tumors   
Similar results were obtained when human soft tissue sarcoma HSTS T overexpressing MMP  or MMP  were injected with oncolytic HSV   
MMP expressing tumors contained significantly less sulfated glycosaminoglycans compared to control tumors 
Other enzymes and protein effectors  either engineered into virus expression cassettes or provided exogenously  include hyaluronidase  decorin  various other MMPs  and notably relaxin a peptide hormone normally expressed during particular phase of pregnancy that does not possess tissue degrading activity itself  but instead induces a number of key collagen degrading proteases seemingly in a tumor specific manner   
Beyer showed that relaxin expressed by murine stem cells improved trastuzumab penetrance and therapy outcome in syngeneic tumor models   
In another study  chimeric adenovirus Ad  expressing relaxin showed increased tumor transduction and virus dissemination   Several other strategies to increase penetration of therapeutics in tumors have been developed   
While the stromal ECM capsule of tumor nodules acts as a physical barrier to virus entry following intravenous injection  it was possible to improve tumor infection by administering vaso active compounds  angiotensin II  histamine  nitroglycerine  before the virus   
This is interesting  as vasculature per se would not be expected to alter or influence the physical composition of the ECM  such as collagen strand thickness 
Instead  virus access to the tumor was improved  most likely by increased access from the blood via tumor stromal adjoining vessels 
Interestingly  in a study with oncolytic herpes virus  anti VEGF monoclonal antibody Bevacizumab given before intravenous virus injection gave poorer anti tumor efficacy than when given after the virus   
The study showed that while HSV is able to enter and infect tumors better through their leaky vasculature compared to Bevacizumab normalized vasculature  vascular normalization by Bevacizumab still gave superior combination efficacy when the virus was already in the tumor 
This effect was likely dependent on altering both physical and biological properties of the tumor  including interstitial pressure and oxygenation 
In another study  anti VEGF A antibody injections in nude mice harboring U  human glioma xenografts led to an increase in MMP  expression and reduction in collagen fiber content  facilitating improved distribution of oncolytic adenovirus within the tumor tissue   
In general  targeting tumor vasculature by oncolytic viruses and including agents that affect tumor vasculature in combination regimens is gaining interest    and it will be interesting to see more specific studies on how vascular acting agents may affect the physical barriers to oncolytic viruses Some viruses do not need an extracellular step for propagating infection  such as members of the herpes and poxvirus families  and may be able to spread from cell to cell 
For example  HSV  is able to infect neighboring cells via lateral tight junctions in a manner dependent on its glycoproteins E and I   
Vaccinia virus  on the other hand  induces so called actin tails  which are actin filament driven membranous protrusions of the plasma membrane harboring a single virus particle at the outer tip 
These actin tails actively deliver and deposit virus particles onto or even into neighboring cells   
Because lateral spread without an extracellular step may circumvent neutralizing immunity as well as some of the physical obstacles the tumor microenvironment imposes  this ability has been engineered into viruses that normally do not possess it 
A promising strategy is to engineer OVs to express membrane fusogenic genes  MFGs  such as gibbon ape leukemia virus  GALV  glycoprotein  reptilian reovirus p  protein  FAST  or the membrane glycoproteins H and F of measles virus   
Quite intriguingly  expression of several different MFGs by oncolytic adenovirus synergized with chemotherapy in anti tumor efficacy both in vitro and in vivo    suggesting that membrane fusion facilitated lateral spread of also chemotherapeutics  which otherwise would not have occurred in a compact tumor 
The potential limitation of cell to cell dependent spread  however  may be that membrane free physical barriers  such as the ECM  may still pose a barrier to spread 
Also  it is unclear whether MFGs or other mechanisms of lateral spread may assist in reaching distant tumor nests Some other strategies to alleviate matrix imposed restrictions to oncolytic viruses have been discussed elsewhere   Tumors of epithelial origin mostly retain the firm cellular integrity seen in their original adhesive intercellular configuration 
Several viruses use cellular receptors which are located in paracellular tight junctions  which may be problematic in tightly packed tumors   
Adenovirus C group viruses use coxsackie adenovirus receptor  CAR  as their primary entry point  whereas adenovirus B  group members and measles virus Edmonston use CD  complement binding molecule as their cellular receptor   
Adenovirus B  group  serotypes       and   entry occurs using desmoglein   DSG    
Of these  CAR and DSG  are preferentially located within tight junctions and are hidden from virus binding   
Also the complement receptor CD  was ascribed a role in maintenance of epithelial cell integrity by interactions with the E cadherin catenin network   
These observations imply that before reaching the potential entry site on the tumor cell the virus must find its way into the junctional space 
Moreover  it has become increasingly clear that for example glioma tumors traditionally targeted by Ad  serotype adenoviruses often express only low levels of CAR and instead much higher levels of CD    Beyond that tight junctions hide multiple virus receptors  they contain a network of adhesion molecules  including ZO  cadherins  claudins and occludin  which  if perturbed  is associated with more aggressive disease in many types of cancer   
Since tight junctions also contain important receptors that mediate tumor promoting signaling and which have been targeted by monoclonal antibodies  notably Her  it would be highly useful to develop strategies that temporarily loosen the tight junction contacts even at cost of a transient increase in tumor metastatic risk 
One of the most interesting approaches has been to exploit the natural propensity of adenovirus serotype   which as part of its natural life cycle creates dodecahedral particles  PtDd  consisting of viral capsid proteins  penton base and fiber that open tight junctions by binding to and dissolving desmoglein  dimers and reducing E cadherin expression  to develop a specific tight junction opening molecule  JO    
Adenovirus type   uses PtDds to promote its own infection  opening the tight junctions ahead of infection to maximize access to desmoglein 
Analogously  when administered to human tumor xenografts  JO  facilitated penetration of trastuzumab much deeper into the tumor tissue than when the monoclonal antibody was administered on its own   
Moreover  JO  synergized with several chemotherapeutics in solid tumor models   
Backed by our own findings with oncolytic SFV  showing that both extracellular matrix and tumor cell compactness restrict virus spread and oncolytic efficacy  we believe combination approaches that target both tight junctions and extracellular matrix will prove effective in future virotherapy development  Figure  An alternative approach to increasing tumor penetration by oncolytic viruses is to alter tumor cell morphology and status 
Notably  cell death and in particular the type of cell death induced by virus has been shown to affect virus distribution within a tumor mass  in a study by Nagano et al  administration of apoptosis inducing paclitaxel before injecting oncolytic herpes simplex virus increased virus dissemination in the tumor  allowing its diffuse in  tunnels  created by shrinking dying tumor cells   Maintenance of physiological adherence is essential for proper ECM function and for retaining cellular integrity 
Therefore  a potential caveat of using ECM degrading proteolytic enzymes or tight junction openers is the risk of neoplastic cell detachment from the tumor ECM and increased risk of metastasis 
While ECM degradation or tight junction opening may operate innocuously  there is also a chance that loss of E cadherins via proteases or via non specific deregulation of tight junction integrity during ECM modulating therapy could trigger pro tumorigenic Wnt β catenin signaling  possibly driving epithelial to mesenchymal transition   
One study showed that ectopic relaxin expression stimulated MMP expression and enhanced breast cancer invasiveness    whereas another paper found short term relaxin exposure to increase breast cancer cell motility whereas long term expression reduced both motility and cancer invasiveness   
In the context of oncolytic viruses  Lavilla Alonso tested several proteases  including hyaluronidase  relaxin  and macrophage metalloelastase  and showed they all could assist adenovirus entry into tumors  yet  the authors did not detect treatment induced metastases or increase in tumor invasiveness   
Another strategy possibly balancing some of the putative risks of tight junction disruption could be to use Wnt dependent oncolytic viruses   Tumors are invariably fenestrated by host fibroblasts  myeloid cells and other non transformed cells  which driven by cancer induced cues can adopt various reprogrammed phenotypes to promote tumor angiogenesis and growth and to alter tumor responses to therapies   
As most of them normally play a role in immune homeostasis and pathogen sensing  they also respond to and influence oncolytic virus infection of tumors Fulci et al 
reported that injection of oncolytic HSV  directly into glioblastoma tumor parenchyma triggered upregulation of CD  and CD  monocytic markers and rapid clearance of virus  likely executed by infiltrating phagocytic cells   
When clodronate liposomes were used to deplete macrophages in vivo  the authors observed a  fold increase in virus titers in the brain tumors concomitant with an   reduction in peripheral CD  macrophages in animal spleens  suggesting that CD  cells migrate into the tumors upon virus injection and limit overall oncolytic efficacy 
While CD  cells were not reduced by peripheral macrophage depletion  arguing that these cells had been recruited to the tumors before the treatment  they could be eliminated in live glioma slices ex vivo  resulting in a  fold increase in virus replication 
Macrophages may secrete antiviral type I interferon constitutively at very low  subnanomolar  levels   and recently Liu et al 
showed that tumor resident CD  macrophages induced a protective antiviral state in ovarian and breast tumors which led to resistance to oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus  VSV  infection   
Type I IFN signaling  JAK  inhibitor Ruxolitinib reversed the resistance  facilitating VSV replication in the macrophage protected cancer cells 
It is tempting to speculate that tumor resident macrophages also rendered syngeneic GL  and DBT mouse gliomas completely refractory to VA  oncolytic alphavirus  as these cells were quite infectable in vitro and live glioma slices regained their sensitivity to virus within   h  indicating dilution of IFN I   Macrophages or the closely related myeloid suppressor cells are the predominant stromal cell type in many tumors and are actively recruited during cancer progression   
Heavy macrophage presence in the tumors indicates that such tumors may be resistant to oncolytic virotherapy  unless depleting preconditioning would be used 
Moreover  as part of the early immune response to virus infection  monocytic cells are rapidly recruited to tumors following intratumoral virus injection 
In one study  depletion of either CD b  cells or VEGF secreted by these cells in mice treated with oncolytic HSV  greatly increased oncolytic efficacy  tentatively linking pro tumorigenic and antiviral angiogenic mechanisms   Another key pro tumorigenic signaling employed by many tumors is up regulation of CXCR  the receptor for chemokine CXCL   also known as SDF  and recruitment of stromal cells expressing CXCL  which maintain the tumor and recruit additional cells to support tumor expansion and invasion  such as endothelial cell progenitors which contribute to neovascularization   
Indeed  high CXCR  expression is a negative prognostic factor for many cancers 
Oncolytic vaccinia virus engineered to express a soluble antagonist of CXCR  showed improved intratumoral virus replication  increased vascular disruption and a markedly reduced infiltration of the tumors by putative immune suppressive and tumor promoting stromal cells   
This study highlights how reducing pro tumor stromal cell effects may alleviate antiviral resistance and yield increased overall therapeutic efficacy 
On the other hand  if the paracrine antiviral effects of tumor homing monocytic cells could be selectively abrogated these cells could favorably be used to ferry oncolytic viruses into tumors 
Indeed  a significant delay in metastatic tumor potential was achieved when macrophages were harnessed to deliver a tumor specific oncolytic adenovirus   What is the antiviral status in human cancer 
Recent analyses from different normal cells that occupy the same organ reveal striking functional variation in components of the type I IFN signaling pathway that correlate with the tissue tropism and virulence of some virus strains   
Can similar variation in such components be found in cancer cells  or do cancer cells make an exception Transformed cells undergo selective elimination by the immune system before becoming cancerous  termed immunoediting  based on observations of differential capacity of immunocompetent mice to reject tumors previously grown in immunocompromised hosts versus syngeneic animals   
Cancer cell responsiveness to type I and type II IFNs plays a role during immunoediting  cancer cells that eventually progress to form a tumor display reduced capacity to respond to IFN gamma  which otherwise would upregulate MHC class I molecules and render the tumors amenable to CD  T cell mediated destruction  whereas responsiveness to type I interferon initially helps tumors avoid immune purging during the editing phase and is then irrelevant   
Of note  the anti tumor effects of type I IFN  still exploited today in several cancers  were shown to depend on host NK cells  and mice in which IFNAR was blocked by monoclonal antibody failed to reject even highly immunogenic tumors  as opposed to mice treated with control antibody  who all rejected the immunogenic tumor challenge   
Thus  whereas tumor responsiveness to type I IFN is not predetermined after immunoediting  other factors post immunoediting may influence it In several tumor types  varying levels of expression of components of the type I IFN signaling cascade have been detected  and in some tumor types these components have been found to have prognostic value  whereas in others they do not seem to influence survival   
However  emerging data suggests that antiviral genes may predict poor survival because they increase treatment resistance 
In one study  poor prognosis of several types of cancer due to genotoxic treatment resistance was found to correlate with increased activity of IFN I pathway genes   
In this study  a triad of type I IFN signaling pathway genes  STAT  ISG  and IFIT  formed a pan tumor type negative prognostic factor  and a broader seven gene cluster established negative prognostic criteria for treatment resistant breast cancer 
Treatment resistance was subsequently shown to depend on STAT  signaling  STAT expressing tumor clones were positively selected in animals in vivo  demonstrating increased proliferation and metastatic potential  and STAT expression mediated resistance against genotoxic assault by doxorubicin or ionizing radiation  knockdown of STAT  resulted in lower proliferation rate and metastatic capacity and increased sensitivity to genotoxic stress    
In another study  resistance to epigenetic DNA modifiers  AZA dC  a methyltransferase inhibitor  and LBH  or MGCD  both histone deacetylase  HDAC  inhibitors  was correlated with increased expression of IFN I pathway genes in small lung cancer cells   
Basal IFN related gene expression in several different SML cell lines was upregulated Interestingly  in many cancers  STAT proteins are not phosphorylated and persist in unphosphorylated form  U STAT 
Like its phosphorylated counterpart  U STAT  increases expression of genes contributing to resistance to DNA damaging agents   
While it is currently unknown why cancers may prefer to use unphosphorylated forms  it is known that U STATs activate distinct signals compared to their phosphorylated counterparts 
However  importantly for oncolytic viruses  in many tumors  constant expression and release of type I IFN leads to a constitutively high level of unphosphorylated forms of STAT  STAT  and IRF  which together form an unphosphorylated but functional ISGF like complex that relocalizes to the nucleus and drives expression of a specific set of ISGs distinct from acute IFN I exposure   
These ISGs are sufficient to maintain a functional antiviral defense and they play a critical role in resistance to DNA damaging agents On a cellular level  virus replication is controlled by antiviral defense molecules    which in turn are primarily controlled by type I IFN signaling 
In addition to classical type I IFN  or cytokine induced antiviral signaling  tumors may employ other antiviral defense mechanisms 
For example  stromal cells may secrete peptides with antiviral properties called defensins   
The defensins are amphiphatic and typically  –  amino acids in length and interfere with viruses by physically binding to and disrupting virus particles and or by inducing antiviral responses in target cells via pattern recognition receptors 
At least oral squamous cell carcinomas were found to overexpress defensins compared to normal control tissues   
While the role of defensins in oncolytic virus infection of tumors is unclear  one study showed that the immune stimulating properties of defensins may be exploited to increase overall therapeutic efficacy 
In this study  expression of beta   defensin from a conditionally replicating adenovirus yielded a superior therapeutic entity compared to the unarmed parental virus via enhanced anti tumor immune responses mediated by TLR dependent activation of dendritic cells   In summary  human cancers display varying degrees of expression of antiviral proteins or their signaling regulators at baseline 
Some of these may increase in response to genotoxic anti cancer treatments 
In the next chapter we will highlight some of the consequences to oncolytic virotherapy of the heterogeneity in type I IFN responsiveness in tumor cells All oncolytic viruses tested to date display variable infectivity in different cancer cell lines 
This variability is likely at least partly dependent on type I IFN as most oncolytic viruses are IFN sensitive 
IFN secretion follows virus sensing by the cells via Toll like receptors expressed on both the plasma membrane and in endocytotic vesicles  NOD like receptors  STING  AIM  NLP inflammosome and other danger sensing molecules  summarized elsewhere   
While all viruses carry an arsenal of counteracting molecules    no virus goes completely undetected 
Even HSV amplicons  which are devoid of functional virus genes  induce a type I IFN response that mediates a STAT dependent system wide antiviral defense in mice within one hour of intravenous vector injection  resulting in significant reduction of transgene expression compared to expression in STAT  knockout animals   During our own studies with attenuated SFV vector VA  it became apparent that the dramatic and lasting therapeutic efficacy achieved following mere single intravenous  or intratumoral  injection of the virus in immunocompromised mice bearing human A  melanoma or U  glioma xenografts   was not going to be recapitulated easily in immunocompetent animals   
The paradox in our studies was that while oncolytic SFV vector VA  effectively replicated in and destroyed a variety of IFN responsive cancer cell lines in vitro  it consistently failed to eradicate tumors generated from the same cell types in vivo  even if large doses of virus were injected directly into the tumor mass and even if the tumors were void of visible physical barriers  Figure  
Conversely  only tumors generated from IFN unresponsive cancer cells have seemed infectable in vivo by VA  so far 
In light of earlier findings by others  showing that type I IFN receptor knockout mice are highly susceptible to SFV infection and quickly succumb to multi organ systemic infection    the parameters for oncolytic SFV efficacy seem clear  tumor cells must be defective in type I IFN response for the virus to be effective These findings are in line with emerging data from other groups  showing a remarkably strict dependence of oncolytic virus replication on defective type I IFN responsiveness  a dogma introduced at the turn of the  st century   
For example  sarcomas and melanomas display differing permissiveness to oncolytic VSV  an obstacle which may be overcome by blocking type I IFN signaling   
In eight sarcoma cell lines  basal up regulation of RIG I and IFIT  and rapid induction of STAT  phosphorylation upon IFN I treatment correlated with resistance to oncolytic measles virus   
In other studies  human pancreatic and ovarian cancer cells display resistance against Rb dependent oncolytic adenovirus  strongly correlating with intracellular levels of MxA  and acquired resistance to repeated oncolytic adenovirus injections in an intraperitoneal ovarian carcinoma model was associated with an increase in MxA as well as several other key ISGs in the tumors   
A study comparing normal human or mouse melanocytes to a panel of melanoma cells revealed strong correlation between permissiveness to oncolytic VSV and capacity to mount antiviral defense in response to type I IFN   
In this study  VSV rp  harboring two mutations in P and L genes  was superior to several other tested oncolytic VSV strains  but the dependence on defective IFN responsiveness was still retained 
In yet another study  oncolytic VSV replicated in four out of twelve mesothelioma cell lines which were unable to mount antiviral defense upon IFN beta pretreatment or to respond to infection by up regulation of PKR  MxA or  OAS mRNA   
In contrast  the non permissive mesothelioma cells mounted antiviral defense  associated with PKR  MxA or  OAS mRNA up regulation  in response to infection or to exogenous type I IFN 
The authors of this study further linked the observed pattern of virus resistance to clinical mesothelioma samples  where in a mesothelioma tissue array  significant variance in immunoreactivity against PKR  p  and or IFNAR was observed  with only a few samples displaying lack of reactivity against all three components  arguing that most tumors in clinical settings would display at least some level of resistance to oncolytic VSV Oncolytic adenoviruses are often deleted for E A  which normally binds Rb and prevents it from sequestering E F  which results in the viruses being unable to replicate in normal cells 
However  since adenovirus  as with all viruses  contains elements that antagonize antiviral defenses  such elements have also been targets for deletion to render the virus sensitive to innate antiviral defenses  which would be expected to remain intact only in normal cells 
Cancer cells expressing Ras may down regulate protein kinase R and inhibit type I IFN induction by interfering with RIG I signaling   
Also  select interferon stimulated genes appear to be repressed by the Ras MEK ERK signaling cascade   
PKR activation shuts down E F dependent translation  including translation of virus messenger RNAs 
Therefore  an adenovirus deleted for VA RNA  which antagonizes PKR  should be capable of replicating in Ras overexpressing  tumor  cells 
However  while this was seemingly the case    it was later discovered that Ras is not an obligatory determinant for PKR inactivation and that virus replication was halted even in Ras overexpressing cells via functional PKR mediated E F phosphorylation  implying that the parameters of VA RNA deleted adenovirus replication had to be revised   
Similar findings were obtained with oncolytic reovirus  against which Ras independent tumor resistance emerged in vivo   
Thus  under some circumstances even tumor cells over expressing Ras may respond to type I IFN or to stimulants of pattern recognition receptors  activating PKR and inhibiting virus translation 
To complicate matters  MEK inhibitors have been shown restore antiviral signaling capacity in Ras overexpressing tumors   
This implies that human tumors treated with MEK inhibitors  such as Trametinib which was recently approved for treatment of BRAF mutated melanoma  may be poor targets for oncolytic viruses as antiviral signaling capacity in such tumors may be restored Some oncolytic viruses  such as members of the poxvirus family  are seemingly resistant to the antiviral effects of type I IFNs in vitro and may be controlled by other cellular factors   
However  in most cases  sensitivity or resistance to type I IFN is assessed in vitro and using only one cytokine  which may mask synergies with other factors present in vivo 
One possible explanation for the in vitro–in vivo discrepancy is the tumor micro environment  which not only imposes physical barriers to oncolytic viruses but also alters intracellular antiviral defenses 
For example  glioma cells were found in the brain to spontaneously secrete type I IFN  which conferred resistance against oncolytic HSV 
Resistance was linked to ECM protein CCN  interaction with glioma cell surface receptor alpha   beta   integrin  which activated interferon secretion   
It is tempting to speculate whether this or a similar ECM glioma interaction could have contributed to the resistance of syngeneic glioma cells we observed in vivo but not in vitro to both oncolytic SFV and vaccinia virus  FIG    
Also  while critical in many respects  antiviral signaling may occur without signaling via type I IFN receptor  IFNAR 
For instance  upon infection of IFNAR KO mice with murine hepatitis virus  MHV  brain cells were found to have upregulated antiviral GTPase TGTP and IFITm  and IFITm  all of which have confirmed antiviral activity in vivo against a variety of viruses   
In these cases  IFN gamma and TNF alpha likely account for at least part of the observed ISG activity  where e g  TGTP is upregulated by IFN γ signaling and TNFα has been shown to induce ISG  independently of IFNAR   Interestingly  while most cancers are heterogeneous in antiviral defence signaling  one broad class of tumors in particular may display consistently low capacity to ward off oncolytic viruses  oncovirus induced cancers 
This is because oncoviruses  as all viruses  carry a complement of factors that abrogate antiviral sensors and effectors  which may result in tumors that are uniformly devoid of antiviral signaling 
In an intriguing study  oncolytic VSV infected and destroyed human papilloma virus  HPV positive cervical carcinoma cells more effectively than HPV negative head  and neck cancer cells due to HPV E mediated suppression of antiviral signaling   
HPV positive or E expressing xenografts were efficiently eradicated from nude mice following VSV injection 
The potential of this approach is that even oncolytic viruses that are extremely sensitive to type I IFN  such as attenuated SFV or M mutated VSV  may function well against oncovirus induced cancers where the oncovirus machinery ensures the lack of antiviral defense While on first thought it would appear counterintuitive to antagonize the very factors that keep oncolytic viruses tumor specific  emerging data shows that this can be accomplished in a safe way 
One of the foremost strategies to increase oncolytic virus efficacy is to combine them with drugs that lower tumor antiviral defenses 
In this regard  a primary target for interference is the prototypical type I IFN signaling cascade 
While small molecular inhibitors against IFNAR are not available  activity of downstream signaling transducers may effectively be blocked 
Human pancreatic cancer cells were shown to constitutively express high levels of MxA and OAS and to mount type I IFN dependent resistance to oncolytic VSV 
Resistance could be overcome by blocking activity of IFNAR associated Janus kinase  JAK      
Similarly  JAK  inhibitor ruxolitinib overcame type I IFN dependent resistance of human SCC  head and neck cancer cells against oncolytic VSV   
Ruxolitinib also successfully abrogated type I IFN mediated antiviral effects elicited by macrophages    highlighting that this drug might also alleviate type I IFN dependent tumor resistance to oncolytic viruses imposed by stromal cells 
However  the obvious downside to using JAK inhibitors is their effects on critical host defense mechanisms  which may result in increased infection of normal cells 
Moreover  JAK inhibitors may reduce anti tumor immune responses elicited by oncolytic virotherapy 
For example  ruxolitinib was shown to impair the capacity of dendritic cells promote CD  T cell responses against model tumor antigens   
On the other hand  in this study clearance of adenovirus was delayed in ruxolitinib treated normal animals  which makes it difficult to predict the overall impact of JAK inhibitors on tumor therapy where prolonged virus presence might translate to better therapeutic efficacy 
Also  while the immune stimulating and anti tumor effects of type I and type II interferons may be adversely affected by JAK inhibitors  central tumor promoting cascades mediated by JAKs  such as IL STAT  may also be inhibited    yielding a difficult to predict net therapeutic outcome 
At the moment  more studies are needed to establish the overall impact of interference with JAK  signaling in cancer therapy Spurred by earlier reports of oncovirus reactivation and promoter enhancement by histone deacetylase  HDAC  inhibitors  this class of agents was assessed for capacity to enhance oncolytic virus potency by inhibiting antiviral responses 
Indeed  such enhancement was observed with oncolytic VSV and SFV  and while it has been difficult to pinpoint the exact mechanisms that underlie HDAC inhibitor enhancement of oncolytic virus replication in cancer cells  antiviral defenses in general are inhibited for yet unknown reasons mainly in cancer cells and not in normal cells  which indirectly facilitates virus replication   
Interestingly  combination of HDAC inhibitors with conditionally replicating   E A deleted adenovirus gave improved virus replication rate and therapeutic efficacy in subcutaneous xenograft models only when the inhibitors were given before the virus  otherwise inhibition of replication was observed   
Similarly  HDAC inhibitors increased replication and oncolytic efficacy of HSV when given before the virus but not when given at the same time   
With nuclear DNA viruses  such as adenovirus and HSV  it is possible that HDAC inhibitors also alter virus genome accessibility to transcription factors  resulting in reduced replication or other adverse effects  implying that with these viruses HDAC inhibitors should be administered before the viruses Recently  it was found that HDAC inhibitor vorinostat activates NfκB signaling by facilitating hyperacetylation of the p  subunit  which in turn activates cellular autophagy   
Autophagy was in another study shown to be important for VSV replication  presumably by inhibiting antiviral signaling 
This is interesting  as a previous study revealed enhancement of VSV replication by inhibiting TNF alpha induced antiviral signaling mediated by p  using NfκB inhibitors BMS  or TPCA    
In this study  neither inhibitor had an effect on STAT  or STAT  phosphorylation or their nuclear relocalization in response to type I IFN but the authors observed clear induction of ISG  GBP  and MX  in response to type I IFN in U  glioma cells  with the latter two being dependent on NfκB signaling 
Taken together  NfκB pathway activation may result in different antiviral responses in different cancer types  and inhibition or enhancement of oncolytic viruses by NfκB inhibitors is dependent on other concomitant cellular mechanisms  such as autophagy Since HDAC inhibitors modulate promoter activity accessibility  it is conceivable other epigenetic or promoter modifying agents could work in a similar manner to repress antiviral defense induction and enhance oncolytic viruses   
DNA demethylating agents  azacytidine  Aza  and decitabine synergized with oncolytic herpes simplex type   virus in glioma models in vitro and in vivo  as did HDAC inhibitor valproic acid  VPA  which was already shown before to work well with oncolytic HSV as well as several other oncolytic viruses   
Moreover  inhibition of cancer antiviral defenses  specifically RNAseL and PKR  resulted when cancer cells were exposed to sunitinib  a multi tyrosine kinase inhibitor originally developed as an inhibitor of VEGF R and PDGF R signaling  yielding strong anti tumor synergy with IFN sensitive oncolytic VSV   
Since sunitinib is approved for renal cell carcinoma and imatinib resistant gastric cancers  combination with oncolytic VSV constitutes a promising and clinically relevant approach warranting further investigation 
Interstingly  sunitinib as well as several other receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors displayed antiviral effects against polyomavirus BK    arguing that these compounds are not universal virus enhancers Cyclophosphamide  CPA  is a general immunosuppressant used to minimize Treg presence during immunotherapy and also oncolytic virotherapy 
CPA may  however  also enhance replication and efficacy of oncolytic viruses by diminishing cytokine secretion by stromal cells  including type I IFN   
Another compound enhancing oncolytic virus efficacy by lowering cell responsiveness to type I IFN is triptolide  which acts downstream of IRF  activation   
Further  the kinase mammalian target of rapamycin  mTOR  enhances the antiviral effects of type I IFN by activation of its effector proteins  E BP  which binds and inactivates translation factor eIF E  and S K  which carries out cell type specific signaling functions of type I IFN  such as activation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor  B and promotion of ISG  transcription 
Consequently  rapamycin was able to enhance oncolytic VSV replication and anti tumor efficacy by inhibiting type I IFN mediated antiviral signaling via mTOR   Several other compounds synergizing with oncolytic viruses have been identified via high throughput drug library screening  many of which seem to act by antagonizing antiviral defenses 
For instance  a novel virus sensitizer  Vse  was found to greatly diminish antiviral effects of type I IFN against oncolytic VSV in several cancer cell types  and the drug also synergized with the virus in subcutaneous mouse tumor models   
For many of these new compounds  the mechanism of action is still poorly understood  necessitating extensive safety studies to exclude undesirable effects against normal cells Apart from classical type I IFN induced antiviral defenses  which typically prevent virus translation and degrade virus genomes  other cellular machineries regulate oncolytic virus efficacy 
Notably  strategies to increase cancer cell death in response to oncolytic viruses have been tested 
In a recent study  a class of compounds called SMAC mimetics synergized in several cancer models with oncolytic VSV by removing cancer cell block to apoptosis in response to virus induced type I IFN  TNF α or TRAIL   
Interestingly  since virus infection triggered cytokines act on nearby non infected cells  SMAC mimetics may in combination with oncolytic viruses also cause significant bystander tumor destruction 
Normal cells are not affected by the IFN SMAC mimetic synergy  providing an important safety aspect 
In another study  blocking the ER stress response circuitry triggered by oncolytic rhabdovirus infection by a small molecular inhibitor of serine threonine protein kinase and endoribonuclease IRE α  which was identified in a genome wide siRNA screen  greatly enhanced cytotoxicity via caspase induced apoptosis and increased oncolytic efficacy in refractory tumor models in mice   
This effect was independent on induction or responsiveness to type I IFN 
Conversely  inhibitors of nucleoside transporter   ENT  were discovered from a high throughput screen of enhancers of oncolytic HSV  and to date such inhibitors have not been reported to alter cellular antiviral responses   
Other compounds  such as common chemotherapeutics  and their mechanisms synergizing with oncolytic viruses have been discussed elsewhere for most of them the possible role of antiviral defense antagonism in enhancing oncolytic virus efficacy remains to be studied   Thus  many compounds are available to interfere with tumor antiviral defenses 
The outstanding question for most of them  however  seems to be why such compounds do not render normal cells sensitive to oncolytic viruses 
Elucidation of the exact mechanisms of action and the differences between normal and cancer cells constitute a worthy goal for studies in the near future Already in the  s it became clear that using certain pathogenic wildtype viruses  such as West Nile virus and Bunyamwera virus  in cancer patients would result in off target toxicity   
Characteristic for pathogenic viruses is a greater ability to circumvent or antagonize cellular innate antiviral defenses than attenuated strains 
For example  unlike the prototypical oncolytic reovirus strain type   Dearing  the T L strain of reovirus causes accumulation of IRF  in the nucleus and inhibits activation of a select group of ISGs yet because of this property the T L strain is myocarditic unlike the oncolytic type   Dearing strain   
For these reasons  many oncolytic viruses used today  such as reovirus type   Dearing  oncolytic strains of Newcastle disease virus and M mutated VSV have either a stronger capacity to induce or a weaker capacity to resist antiviral type I IFN than the corresponding wildtype strains   An open question  however  is whether strain specific or virus specific differences that relate to specific components of the cellular antiviral machinery may be exploited for greater anti tumor efficacy  i e  if one virus fails  could another be used in its stead 
While Ras expression was critical for oncolytic reovirus replication in cells overexpressing CUG  oncogene  oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus was unable to replicate in the same cells due to increased activation of STAT  and OASL    
Thus  in these cells reovirus was not affected by STAT  or OASL  and it therefore remains interesting to see which other antiviral effectors may have been lacking in the CUG expressing cells and  conversely  how reovirus and VSV differ in terms of sensitivity to antiviral effectors 
While several oncolytic viruses have been compared to each other in terms of replication rate and cytotoxicity  systematic studies with regard to tumor antiviral defenses have not been conducted As any attenuated virus is likely to replicate effectively only in its own niche  i e  to be restricted by a specific set of ISGs  and as wild type strains may be too toxic for use in humans  a compromise may be achieved by incorporating select elements from wild type viruses into oncolytic virus backbones 
Indeed  several chimeric and recombinant viruses have been generated that harbor specific elements of wild type strains or even of other unrelated viruses in order to better resist cancer antiviral defenses  Table  
As an example of introducing wild type elements into attenuated viruses  Haralambieva reported on a measles virus Edmonston vaccine strain in which P gene was replaced with the counterpart from the wild type IC B strain   
Later  Meng et al 
included N  P  and L genes from wild type measles in Edmonston backbone  producing an enhanced but still safe oncolytic virus   
Edmonston vaccine virus induces a more robust IFN response compared to wild type measles virus partly due to the weaker ability of V protein to suppress MDA mediated activation of IRF  and IFN I induction   
In vivo  P gene encoded proteins  particularly V  control the quality of the cytokine response to measles so that vaccine strains qualitatively induce a stronger inflammatory response compared to WT strains  where WT V protein suppresses multiple cytokine secretion 
V protein short cytoplasmic tail has been shown to bind and inactivate STAT  IRF  MDA  and the Rel homology domain of the NfκB subunit p  but not of p    
Also  V causes LGP  protein to bind and inactivate RIG I    but it seemingly does not interfere with TICAM   TRIF  multiple TLR adaptor  including TLR mediated IFN β induction 
Thus  if cancer and normal cells would differ with regard to TICAM  or IRF  then such a virus could potentially target specifically cancer cells rather than normal cells 
So far  the measles Edmonston WT chimeras have proven safe in animals As an example of heterologous virus constructs  lentogenic Newcastle disease virus engineered to express influenza virus PR   H N  NS  showed enhanced oncolytic efficacy in vivo due to dampening of antiviral responses   
While such a virus did not display enhanced pathogenicity in that study  a mesogenic NDV virus harboring NS  from influenza strain H N  did show increased pathogenicity in chickens as well as an increased ability to replicate in human cells    raising some cautionary warnings for future engineering of similar replicative viruses 
As another example  vaccinia virus soluble type I IFN scavenger B R  NOTE  B R is often used in the literature  has been engineered into both oncolytic HSV and oncolytic rhabdoviruses  resulting in all cases in more effective therapy agents without loss of tumor specificity   
Oncolytic γ  gene deleted HSV was complemented by two different PKR antagonists from human cytomegalovirus  TRS  and IRS  generating a chimera capable of reaching wild type virus replication levels in cancer cells in vitro and in tumor models in vivo   The selection of various viral IFN I antagonists that potentially could be used to augment attenuated oncolytic viruses is vast   
For example  increased replication of several viruses  including HIV  Sindbis virus and E deleted adenovirus in mammalian cells was observed when the cells were engineered to express vaccinia virus E L protein  influenza A virus NS  protein  ebola virus VP  protein or HIV  Tat protein   
The choice of antagonist must primarily be made with safety in mind  but virus specific and cell specific differences in antagonist functions may potentially be exploited rationally when considering the overall combination 
For example  vaccinia virus E L is able to rescue VSV but not EMCV from exogenous IFN  whereas vaccinia virus K L partially rescued EMCV but not VSV   In anticipation of systematic  perhaps bioinformatically guided   super chimera  studies  two or more viruses that may complement each other s shortcomings in antiviral defense antagonism have been considered 
Notably  vaccinia virus was favorably combined with IFN I sensitive oncolytic VSV and SFV  yielding tumor model dependent increases in overall therapy efficacy that were dependent on vaccinia virus antagonism of type I IFN responses  which increased the replication of the IFN sensitive viruses   
Such heterologous virotherapy approaches may also be used to generate immunological synergy  similar to heterologous prime boost vaccination  anti tumor immune responses may be increased due to targeting of the tumor by two different viruses  on two separate occasions  but anti virus immune responses would be generated against different viruses each time  avoiding the problem of neutralizing immunity to and predominance of antivirus immune responses   
Some other ideas explored experimentally include engineering oncolytic viruses to express other oncolytic viruses 
For example  the entire oncolytic parvovirus H  genome was placed under a regulatable promoter in oncolytic adenovirus  resulting in a more effective therapeutic entity than either virus alone without loss of tumor specificity   
The genetic material of Semliki Forest virus replicons has been engineered into adenovirus and vaccinia virus backbones   and several other virus chimeras have been constructed   
However  the effects on tumor antiviral defenses of such a constructs remain to be studied The attribute  oncolytic  implies for a virus that it infects and  indeed  lyses the infected tumor 
This property is primarily tested in vitro in cultured tumor cells 
We have learned  however  that in the native tumor microenvironment in living hosts many viruses are no longer able to infect tumor cells or to kill them even if they manage to infect them 
Tightly packed tumor cells and the network of supportive molecules of the extracellular matrix form a physical barrier to virus particle diffusion 
It has also become evident that the tumor cells themselves may be much more capable of thwarting oncolytic virus advances than previously thought  with some tumor cells residing in a seemingly permanent non permissive antiviral state 
Tumors harbor multiple cell types in addition to the neoplastic cells  which may promote and propagate both physical and cellular virus resistance 
As the efficacy of virotherapy in human cancer patients still falls shy of the achievements in animal models  it appears quite plausible that one or more of the barriers described in this review indeed constitute a real and formidable obstacle for oncolytic virus advancement into routine clinical use 
Fortunately  some of the most difficult barriers have been identified  and a rapidly expanding arsenal of countermeasures is at our disposal 
Our task is now to separate the wheat from the chaff and to systematically evaluate the proposed combination regimens that will yield the best results without compromising patient safety Evidence of prenatal toxicity of herbal based indigenous formulations for sex selection in rat modelsTraditional or indigenous preparations  IPs  are getting considerable attention in global health debates  It continues to be used widely in several countries and its consumption is rapidly increasing 
 
  Many reports have documented the use of such preparations 
For instance  in China  traditional herbal medicines played a critical role during the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome  SARS  In fact  many drugs in modern medicine had their roots in the traditional system of medicine 
Drugs like Penicillin  from Penicillium fungi  and Digoxin  from Digitalis purpurea  are some such examples 
One of the promising therapies for Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus  MRSA  infection is a ninth century treatment for eye infections which is a recipe consisting of garlic and onions  wine  and bile from a cow s stomach brewed in a brass cauldron 
It is however important to note that culture specific practices are not always safe 
Digitalis is a classic example where herbalists use this plant in allopathic treatment strategies  while in some countries such as Britain  law restricts their vast availability  A report from Australia describes the adverse effects of ‘herbal  preparations or IPs  Problems arise when people do not report about the consumption of such preparations assuming that these are devoid of any side effects by virtue of them being natural products  The need for research in this field is huge and scientific research into the quality  safety  molecular effects and clinical efficacy is crucial 
 
 
Pregnancy is considered a time of minimal intervention  and a period when herbal medicines are usually contraindicated  It is reported that many women consume indigenous medicines  that contains Bryonia laciniosa  Quercus infectoria and Putranjiva roxburghii along with other ingredients  during early pregnancy to beget a male child in India 
These preparations  often called sex selection drugs  SSD  contain herbal ingredients but these are off the label prescriptions and hence cannot be certified as ‘herbal  medicines 
The prevalence of consumption varies from   to as high as         Studies have indicated that there is  –  times higher risk of birth defects including major malformations of internal organs like urogenital and renal malformation  trachea esophageal fistula  and visible defects like spina bifida  cleft lip palate and imperforate anus 
 
  Risk of stillbirths also increases   folds 
Studies suggest that a single exposure during pregnancy can be deleterious 
 
 
 
  SSDs are reported to contain phytoestrogens  steroids and heavy metals 
 
 
 
  It is also known that although placenta serves as a barrier  most drugs and environmental chemicals enter the foetal circulation by passive diffusion or active transport  However  despite growing evidence on deleterious effects of these herbal formulations  few studies have attempted to systematically understand the risk of such preparations using animal models 
Genetic sex of a child is determined at the time of conception by the fertilization of the ovum with X or Y sperms and intake of so called preparations for sex selection can never alter that In view of these  the current study was conducted with an objective to determine the embryo foetal and development toxicity of SSDs following maternal exposure during critical period of organogenesis using a small animal model The study was guided by the OECD guidelines for testing of chemicals  Guideline no    adopted on  nd January   Prenatal Developmental Toxicity Study  and was based on a mutually approved protocol 
Personal protection equipment was employed as required while handling the test system The test facility is registered and renewed  No 
 PO RcBi S CPCSEA dated July     for breeding and to conduct research on animals for commercial purpose by the committee for the purpose of control and supervision of experiments on animals  CPCSEA  Ministry of Environment  Forests and Climate Change  Government of India 
The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee  Venus Medicine Research Center 
Due permission was taken from the Ethics Committee of Indian Institute of Public Health Delhi For this experiment  strain of Sprague Dawley of rats  Rattus norvegicus  was used 
The number of dams per group was   instead of   as laid down under OECD guidelines 
Rats of both sexes  –  g  were obtained from National Institute of Biologicals  India at  –  weeks of age  acclimatized for five days and then subjected to the experiment at  –  weeks of age 
They were housed in standard polypropylene rat cages with stainless steel top grill  one dam per cage  at a temperature of       °C  with  –  relative humidity 
Bedding material and cages were changed once in six days and   hourly light dark cycle was followed 
Animals were identified by their existing ear numbering 
Cages were labelled by tags indicating the study number  sex  group of the animals  experimental start and completion dates 
Standard pelleted feed  from Ashirwad Industries  Mohali  India  was provided ad libitum to all the animals 
They also had free access to purified water via drinking bottles throughout the study 
The feed  cages and drinking bottles were not analysed for the presence of phytoestrogens and bisphenol A 
However  similar materials were used for all the rats across all groups The drug comprised of IPs for sex selection  SSD 
These non branded locally made preparations are made available  –  days after placing an order and are never sold openly 
These preparations essentially contain herbal ingredients such as Shivlingi  Bryonia laciniosa  Majuphal  Quercus infectoria  Putrajeevak  Putranjiva roxburghii  Nagkesar  Mesua ferrea  and feather of peacock  Pavo cristatus 
A total of   such samples of SSDs were procured from varied sources like ‘pansari  shop owners  grocers  local alternative medicine practitioners  rickshaw pullers  drivers and commoners from different states 
SSDs are advised to be consumed between   and   weeks of pregnancy The samples were categorized into   groups based on redundancy of the preparations and common ingredients reported 
This was followed by chemical analysis in an accredited laboratory to detect the presence of phytoestrogens and steroids 
Since we explored the toxic effects of these preparations we wanted to select two samples that would be most predictive of toxicity 
Due to resource constraints  we did not want to subject all the   samples for animal study 
Hence  three samples of SSDs  found to be most rich in phenols and steroids were selected for toxicity study  All the three samples were also tested for heavy metals which suggested that Lead and Mercury were in very high quantities  The toxicity was examined using C  elegans  an alternate animal model 
Survival analysis and reproductive toxicity was assessed from the brood size and progeny count assay  The two SSDs that were found to be most toxic were selected as test items for the subsequent study in rat models 
SSD   was reported to contain Shivlingi and Putrajeevak while SSD   contained Shivlingi  Majuphal  Putrajeevak  Nagkesar and feathers of peacock 
Both the samples were obtained from grocers 
Local preparations like these are bound to have certain degree of variability in concentrations but more often than not  these remain the major ingredients According to studies reported  women consume such preparations along with cow s milk in dosages and schedule that are quite varied 
While some advise these IPs to be consumed for one day  others prescribe it for   days  to be taken thrice a day 
We considered the amount of SSDs most commonly reported by pregnant women  weighing   kg  which was  –  g daily for   days 
The dose of the test item   mg kg  was calculated by using conversion factor of  Conversion factor is the ratio of the correction factors  estimated by dividing the average body weight in kgs of species by the body surface area in m  of the species  Km 
Human equivalent dose  HED in mg kg    Animal dose  mg kg  X correction factor  Km animal Km human 
Kms of every species are constant 
For humans it is    assuming average weight of adults to be   kg a surface area of   m  and for rats it is  Therefore  HED   mg  kg    animal dose X  
Or  animal dose         mg kg           mg kg Since pregnant women consume these orally  these were administered to rats by oral route The test items were coded as SSD   and SSD   and were provided to the experimental laboratory  Venus Medicine Research Center  Baddi  in powder form 
On the day of dosing  the doses were administered between  –  h  The test items were administered in fresh cow s milk at a final volume of   ml kg 
The doses were calculated on the basis of the latest body weight recorded for the study 
A stainless steel gavage cannula fitted to a calibrated syringe was used for dosing the animals For control animals  cow s milk was used as a vehicle while feeding The study was performed in two phases to evaluate the effect of SSD consumption duration during gestation period Adult  nulliparous female rats were mated with males of same species and strain in  
Each morning  dams were examined for the presence of a vaginal plug and vaginal smear was taken from each dam by using pipette smear technique 
The day of vaginal plug formation or sperms observed in vaginal smear  also known as successful mating  were considered as GD   Gestation day  
The mated females were housed individually in clear polycarbonate cages with stainless steel wire lids 
Mating process was carried out to result in   pregnant animals per group 
Successfully mated females were randomized into control and treatment groups 
All the rats were sacrificed on GD  
According to OECD guidelines  the test chemical should be administered daily from implantation to the day prior to scheduled caesarean section in order to assess toxicity 
Test chemicals were administered to pregnant animals and sacrificed as per the schedule  which was as close as possible to the normal day of delivery without risking loss of data resulting from early delivery i e GD  
The females were killed  before caesarean section  the uterine contents were examined  and the fetuses were evaluated for soft tissue and skeletal changes The pregnant rats were randomized to two intervention and one control groups

Cage side observations for clinical signs of toxicity in the animals were recorded once daily until the day before necropsy •Body weight  Body weight of all experimental animals were recorded once before mating  initial body weight  and then after confirmation of mating 
Body weights were recorded on days               and on terminal day before sacrifice 
These recorded body weights were used for calculating the dose volume to be administered •Food consumption  Food consumption was evaluated once after successful mating or on day   of gestation  the day of vaginal plug formation or sperms observed in vaginal smear  and on days             and one day prior to sacrifice 
Calculated amount of feed were placed in the trough of each cage and the quantity of feed remaining after approximately   h were weighed and recorded •Morbidity Mortality  All the animals were observed twice daily  once in the morning between   and   h and once in the evening between   and   h  for incidence of morbidity and or mortality •Maternal examination related parameters  At the end of the observation period  all the dams were sequentially euthanized  by CO  asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation  and subjected to gross necropsy 
After termination  dams were examined macroscopically for any structural abnormalities or pathological changes 
Blinding was done while evaluation of the dams during caesarean section and subsequent foetal analyses to minimize bias 
Pregnancy rate was calculated as the proportion of mated pairs that had produced at least one pregnancy within a fixed period where pregnancy was determined by the earliest available evidence that fertilization has occurred 
Gestation index was calculated to indicate number of females with live born as a proportion of number of females with evidence of pregnancy •Examination of uterine contents  Immediately after termination  the uteri were removed and the pregnancy status of the animals ascertained 
Gravid uteri including the cervix were weighed  and number of corpora lutea were determined 
The uterine contents were examined for numbers of embryonic or foetal deaths and live foetuses 
The degree of resorption was described in order to estimate the relative time of death of the conceptus 
Any increase in the number of resorption and or implantation loss is an indicator of litter size for the individual dam •Examination of foetuses  The sex and weight of each foetus were determined 
Approximately one half of each litter were prepared and examined for skeletal alterations from selected dams 
The remainder were prepared and examined for soft tissue alterations  using accepted or appropriate serial sectioning methods or careful gross dissection techniques 
Each foetus was examined for external alterations 
Foetuses were examined for skeletal alterations  using Alizarin Red S staining method 
The fetuses for skeletal staining were kept in pre labelled plastic containers containing   ethanol before staining 
After skinning  we processed the foetus for staining by immersing in   alcian blue   GX for three days  then performed rehydration through a gradient series of ethanol   ethanol   –  h twice    ethanol   –  h  ethanol   –  h  distilled water until the samples sank to the bottom of a conical tube 
Samples were further treated with   KOH for  –  days or until it became clear and again treated with   alizarin red for next  –  days until bones became purple 
Samples were rinsed   times in   KOH  for  –  h at each time point 
Samples were further treated with a gradient series of glycerol  KOH    h   glycerol   h X  Visceral examination was done by micro dissection technique 
Fetuses were preserved in   formalin until they became fixed 
An illuminated magnifier was used for visceral examination 
We placed the foetus in a supine position on a paraffin wax block tray covered with paraffin wax  secured the fetal limbs by paper pins to the paraffin wax block  made a ventral midline incision from the umbilicus  cutting caudally to the genital tubercle and cranially to the diaphragm 
Once incision was completed  we located the ventral attachment of the diaphragm and lifted the liver carefully to examine the diaphragm for abnormal opening 
After observation  the diaphragm was clipped 
We gave a longitudinal cut to open the rib cage slightly lateral to and on the right of the sternebrae and then extended the cut anteriorly to neck region 
The rib cage was opened gently and secured to the paraffin block petridish tray with pins Foetuses were examined for soft tissue alterations  e g 
variations and malformations or anomalies  using Wilson s Technique 
The fetal viscera were examined sequentially  beginning with thoracic organs and moving caudally 
We performed hearts cuts after completion of other observations 
We examined the bilobed thymus for size  shape  coloration and presence of haemorrhages and then removed it for observation of trachea and esophagus 
We observed the lungs for size  color and number of lobes  observed the trachea  esophagus for normal alignment and presence of fistula  opened the pericardial sac and cut off pericardium to expose the heart for observation 
We checked the size  shape  color of the heart and normal development of major blood vessels 
After observation of thoracic viscera  we observed the abdominal viscera and liver for size  shape  color  texture  and number of lobes 
External anatomy of heart was examined by making two incisions using micro dissecting scissors We examined the stomach  spleen  pancreas  small and large intestines for size  position or any other developmental anomalies 
The intestines were moved aside after observation for seeing the underlying structures 
Ureters were checked for normal size and location and for continuity from the renal hilus to the urinary bladder 
One kidney was cut transversely and another was longitudinally to examine renal papilla and renal pelvis 
To confirm the sex of the foetus  the gonads were inspected carefully 
We examined the reproductive organs for size  shape and location GraphPad Prism® statistical software version   was used to analyze the data and all the results were represented as mean   S E M 
Intergroup variance for most of the parameters was calculated by one way analysis of variance  ANOVA  followed by Tukey s test 
A value of p     was regarded statistically significant 
Linear regression was performed to examine the weight change of dams during pregnancy for each group comparing with the control after adjusting for the litter size 
The malformations were analysed by performing Chi square test for trend for two groups  SSD  G  G  G  G  and SSD  G  G  G  G The ARRIVE guidelines were followed to report the findings 
In phase   pre natal study  all the dams dosed with SSD  and SSD  had normal food intake and weight gain 
The average gain in weight from GD  to GD   was       gms for controls while it was       gms in SSD   and       gms in SSD 
 Webtable  
No test item related mortality or clinical sign of toxicity was encountered during the study 
All dams in treatment groups and control group survived to scheduled terminal sacrifice 
They showed normal behaviour until euthanized 
There were no differences in mean maternal body weights  body weight gains  pregnancy rate  gestational index  pre and post implantation loss  and resorptions 
No significant differences were observed in foetal sex ratio  foetal body weights 
However  one dam from SSD  had all male foetuses 
No abnormality was detected in skeletal and visceral examination In phase   controls and SSD  and SSD  treated dams exhibited a comparable food intake  Table  
 
However  a dose response relationship was observed with reduced weight gain with higher doses of SSDs 
 Table  
 
Two dams  one in G   SSD    mg kg  and the other in G   SSD    mg kg  categories showed decreased or consistent body weight GD  onwards 
On an average  the weight on GD   was       gms in controls while it was       with SSD    mg kg  and       gms with SSD    mg kg 
The adjusted analysis indicated that except in G  there was a significant reduction in weight gain in all the intervention groups as compared to the control group after controlling for litter size  Table  
 During follow up  one dam from SSD    mg kg  and one from SSD    mg kg  showed haematuria during gestational day  – 
However  no another clinical sign of toxicity was encountered during the study 
All the dams in treatment and control groups showed normal behaviour and survived to scheduled terminal sacrifice 
In phase   pregnancy rate and gestational index were found to be   at all dose levels with SSD  whereas  in SSD  it decreased to   in G   SSD    mg kg  and G   SSD    mg kg  groups 
One dam from G   SSD    mg kg  and another one from G   SSD    mg kg  group showed mating confirmation during vaginal smear examination and showed positive sign in initial days of pregnancy but during necropsy on expected day of delivery  GD   no foetus was found 
Body weights of dams increased in the initial stages that became constant at a later period 
To reconfirm it  non gravid uterus was stained in salewski strain and presence of conceptus was found 
This indicated the possibility of miscarriage Increased pre and post implantation losses as well as resorptions and reduced live foetuses were observed with both SSD  and SSD 
No significant differences were observed in foetal sex ratio  but decreased foetal body weights were noted in both sexes 
On an average one early resorption in a group was a normal observation 
More than one late resorption was observed in all treatment groups while there was none in the control group 
Total count of live foetuses count was significantly reduced with SSD  and SSD  treatment in a dose dependent manner 
Total number of live foetuses were reduced up to   in SSD  at   mg kg treatment group and   in SSD  at   mg kg treatment group Both SSD  and SSD s at different dose levels showed decreased fetal weight in dose dependent manner  although the difference was not significant 
Skeletal and soft tissue alterations were observed in both treatment groups 
In general  the embryo–foetal examination showed abnormalities  which could have caused some functional damage to these foetuses if allowed to grow in the normal course 
In visceral examinations  slight dilation of the renal pelvis  reduced papilla size  urinary bladder hypertrophy was observed in few foetuses from both SSD  and SSD  treatment groups 
Few incidences of foetal soft tissue abnormalities encountered in this study were normal variants 
Skeletal examination showed variations in the ossification patterns like incomplete or poorly ossified skulls  ossification of sternebra  cleavage ossification of thoracic centrum  asymmetric thoracic centrum  and supernumerary rib in many foetuses in SSD  and SSD  groups  Table  
 
A trend was noted with increased incidence of certain malformations with increasing dosages of SSDs that was statistically significant for most malformations with SSD The results of this developmental toxicity study suggest that administration of SSDs to pregnant rats had significant impact on intrauterine foetal growth  early and late resorption as well as developmental anomalies 
These formulations have teratogenic potential but does not affect sex ratio IPs contain phytoestrogens like diadzein and genistein  In vitro rat whole embryo culture assay  WEC  studies of genistein in rats have indicated fetotoxic and teratogenic potential at concentration of ≥  μg mL  However  in vivo  an oral  gavage  embryonic and fetal development pilot study could not demonstrate any teratogenic effect in the same study 
These findings are different from our study probably because we used SSDs containing natural herbal and non herbal ingredients unlike those studies where synthetic genistein was used 
In both the studies  decreased body weight was observed indicating slight maternal toxicity 
Food consumption was unaffected in our study which is contrary to what was reported 
In another study  pregnant rats exposed to oral isoflavones  diadzein and genistein in varying combinations  showed alterations in the number of live foetuses  lysed foetuses  number of resorption sites  and implantation sites while no clinical signs suggestive of maternal toxicity  seizures  tremors and salivation  that was observed similar to our study 
Maternal mass gain was significantly reduced in rats treated with   mg kg of isoflavones  Ratio of females to males in the litter of different groups was similar akin to our finding  These observations clearly nullify the claim that consumption of SDDs could alter the sex of the growing foetus 
An analysis done by the same authors earlier revealed that SSDs contain testosterone and steroids 
 
  The prenatal testosterone in pregnancy is known to affect sexual development adversely      The principles of reproductive biology state that the genetic sex of an individual is determined at the time of conception and can never be altered under any circumstances 
However  phenotypic sex of the growing foetus is likely to be influenced by the hormonal milieu of in utero environment 
Our analysis was confined to phenotypic sex only and hence it is difficult to state if any differences existed with reference to genetic and phenotypic sex 
This requires further inquiry Evidence on the effects of SSDs on humans should best be obtained from human beings 
The findings of the current study corroborate well with the evidence generated from observational studies in human beings      Presence of skeletal and visceral malformations could explain why stillbirths are likely to be more in women who consume SSDs 
The dosing of the test drugs was intended not only to examine the period of organogenesis solely but to assess effects from preimplantation  through the entire period of gestation to the day before caesarean section 
The results were based on observations of more than   female animals with implantation sites at necropsy that added to its strength 
Unnecessary handling of pregnant animals as well as any stressors from outside was avoided 
At least three dose levels and a concurrent vehicle control were used with dams randomly allocated to different treatment groups that support the validity of the results 
However  absence of   rats per group does not support it to be a fully OECD compliant study 
We did follow the principles of Good Laboratory Practices  GLP  but due to constraints of resources the study could not be conducted as a GLP compliant study  though this is optimal for academic interests There is a lack of systematic approach to assess the safety and effectiveness of herbal preparations 
Ingredients for herbal medicines are often drawn from different sources and are used in combination  which may exhibit variability in terms of species  growing conditions  and biologically active constituents 
To isolate each active ingredient from each herb and then to establish its toxicity is time consuming  resource intensive and not practical 
Moreover  drug approval process does not accommodate undifferentiated mixtures  Though important  it surpasses the herb herb interaction and the potentiating effect of one compound over another 
Therefore  in our study  we administered the herbal mixture to assess the effects 
Real time evaluations have yielded important observations for several herbal drugs especially related to pregnancy 
For instance  Wang et al 
  used mice model to evaluate the adverse pregnancy outcomes after maternal exposure to the herbal medicines  particularly during early pregnancy  The major events included maternal and perinatal mortality 
Maternal weight gain  embryo growth and post natal weight gain were significantly decreased 
Moreover  foetal resorption and skeletal malformations were increased  signifying potential toxicity of Chinese herbal medicines 
This is comparable to our findings To conclude  the results of this developmental toxicity study suggest that administration of SSD  and SSD  to pregnant rats exerted significant impact on intrauterine foetal growth and development without any effect on sex ratio when administered during the period of organogenesis 
The prenatal exposure of SSD  and SSD  at dosage level of   mg kg day and   mg kg day during gestational days  –  to female rats had demonstrable effect on maternal or embryo foetal toxicity and teratogenicity SBN and AG conceptualized the study  AS and DD developed the study protocol and conducted the experiment  analysed the data and interpreted the findings

It is therefore natural to expect that the distribution of amino acids  across all protein sequences  would appear to be fixed  given no mutations over a specific period of time 
Of the   naturally occurring amino acids  each seems to appear randomly located at a particular position within the sequence of a protein 
However  when the sequences of a group of proteins are compared to one another  specific patterns begin to emerge 
These patterns are commonly referred to as motifs and frequently produce similar structural elements and in many cases  similar functions between the proteins that contain them 
In recent years  significant efforts have been made to reduce sequences into discrete motifs  so that each can be linked to some specific biological function based on particular rules      
Databases that consist of identifiable amino acid motifs  such as PROSITE  Pratt and EMOTIF  have been constructed to allow researchers an easy classification of unknown proteins into families based on their common motifs               
All of these methods share one property  they depend on specific alignment algorithms  such as the basic local alignment search tool  BLAST or PSI BLAST  to perform the sequence comparison between diverse families of proteins being analyzed      
These methods have already led to a number of key discoveries and offer the promise of determining biologically meaningful information about function from a protein s primary sequence It is generally accepted that a strong correlation exists between a protein s amino acid sequence and its resulting structure and function         
Techniques that can quickly determine significant similarities between protein sequences are valuable in predicting an unknown protein s function within the cell 
Here we describe a procedure that  by computing the frequency of key amino acid pairs  can quickly classify large groups of proteins into functional groups 
In order to uncover any relevant amino acid strings  we have utilized statistical methods applicable to datasets with large fluctuations in the search of human protein sequences within both the Swiss Prot and Complete Human Genebank databases The goal of this manuscript is to demonstrate how these two residue motifs can be used to develop rapid methods for searching protein or genomic databases in order to locate potentially interesting or aberrant protein sequences 
As an example  we describe the distribution of select amino acid pairs within the genome of the Coronavirus  Tor  which is responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome  SARS    
We have examined additional sets  but the limited format of this paper precludes a large presentation of potential applications The set of all   naturally occurring  amino acids are described by their standard single letter representations  and are taken as the complete set contained within all protein sequences as shown below Zq A R N D C Q E G H I L K M F P S T W Y V Residues that are arranged in a certain order can be referred to as vectors and are represented symbolically as b n b b bn bj Zq The coordinates of each vector represent the amino acid symbols contained within any given protein  where n is the total length of the vector 
The collection of all vectors b n  in the proteome can therefore be denoted simply by Zq n The underlying structure of a protein sequence  which is the order of the amino acids  has unique and identifiable characteristics 
As an analogy  in written English  the letter q is almost always followed by u 
Also  the frequency of the word  and  is much higher than that of the related three letter strings   nad   nda   dan  and  dna  which are simply permutations of the same set of individual letters to construct a word with a different meaning 
Utilizing similar characteristics  we can intuitively scan for unique sequence vectors contained within any given protein 
We expand on these characteristics  by utilizing the concepts of affinity and order stability in Section  Using the entire Swiss Prot database  release number   as the basis for our calculations  we have constructed a probability table for the occurrence of the   naturally occurring amino acids  see Table  
    
In addition to the Swiss Prot database  we have also included data from Complete Human Genebank  NCBI Build Number   March    as a source for all characterized and hypothetical human protein sequences We use the symbol Ω to denote the Swiss Prot database  and the letter M to denote the number of proteins in the database  
Hence we can state that Ω As s M  where As a a as Ns  is the sth protein  ai with i Zq is the ith amino acid in the sequence  and Ns is the length of the protein sequence As 
For any vector b n  if there is a sequence As in Ω such that b n  is a segment of As  then we can say b n  occurs in Ω 
We can then use NΩ b n  to denote the total number of outcomes that b n  has occurred in Ω  and let NΩ n  be the total number of all vectors occurring in Ω with length n  Therefore p b n NΩ b n NΩ n is the probability that the vector b n  occurs in Ω 
We then introduce k p q b n log p b n q b n where p b n  and q b n  are any two probability distributions on Zq n  and b n  belongs to Zq n 
The quantity k p q b n  in Eq 
  is defined for any two probability distributions p b n  and q b n  on Zq n  where the distribution q arises from independent letter  i e  amino acid  probabilities 
Then  k p q b n  can be viewed as a random variable about b n  and its probability distribution is defined as follows F p q x PI k p q b n ⩽x b n k p q b n ⩽xp b n The expectation value μ p q  and variance σ p q  of p b n  are expressed mathematically as μ p q b n Zq n p b n k p q b n 
 σ p q b n Zq n p b n k p q b n μ p q  Hence we see that μ p q  is simply the Kullback–Leibler entropy   
As a consequence  μ p q  is always non negative and μ p q  if and only if p b n q b n 
As a result  the amino acid sequence of b n  can be represented by k p q b n In Eq 
  the probability distributions p  q in the k p q b n  have several possible values 
For example  if we let p be the probability of b n  and only change the value of q in k p q b n  we obtain the following expression q b n j np bj p b p b p bn Based on Eqs 
  and   the value of k p q b n  gives us the affinity for all amino acids within vector b n 
Here two situations are identified as especially interesting i When k p q b n  implies that among the amino acids in vector b n  there is an increased affinity 
That is  the vector b n  occurs more frequently than expected 
 ii When k p q b n  implies that among the amino acids in vector b n  there is a decreased affinity 
That is  the vector b n  occurs less frequently than expected In a similar approach to the condition described above  we may choose q b n p πn b n  where πn b n  is a permutation of b n  and πn denotes a permutation transform 
In this case  the order sensitivity of b n  can also be reflected by the value of k p q b n  and produces the following outcomes i when k p q b n  implies that b n  occurs much more often than πn b n ii when k p q b n  implies that πn b n  occurs much more often than b n In addition to the concepts of affinity and order sensitivity  we can also design other analysis techniques by choosing alternate representations of q b n 
Quantifying the terms k p q b n  we can represent vector frequency numerically 
In cases where k p q b n μ p q ⩾ σ p q  the corresponding vector b n  is called  positive  while in those cases where the opposite takes place  k p q b n μ p q ⩽ σ p q  the vector b n  is called  negative 
By judiciously choosing a   equal to   we obtained   two residue  positive pairs  and   two residue negative pairs  see Table  
  out of a total of   possibilities of amino acid pairs Using any one of the positive motifs from Table   we can develop a test method to detect changes in their distribution through any protein database 
If b b b  is  positive  then p b b μ σp b p b  where p ⋅  is the probability of the amino acids or vectors ⋅ in the database 
Since NΩ μ M Nμ p bj NΩ bj μ MNμ we have NΩ b μ M Nμ μ MNμ μ σp b NΩ b or NΩ b μ M Nμ μ MNμ μ σp b NΩ b and since μ M Nμ is very close to μ MNμfor Swiss Prot database we have NΩ b μ σp b NΩ b and NΩ b μ σp b NΩ b As a consequence of Eq 
  the detection of a deleterious mutation based on the increased appearance of an arbitrary string of these residues becomes possible 
For example  according to Table   CC is an attractive motif with   then NΩ CC μ σp C μ M Nμ μ MNμNΩ C ≈ μ σp C NΩ C Let Ns CC  and Ns C  be the number of CC and the number of C in the sth protein 
Then we have NΩ CC NΩ C  because μ σ  and p C  since NΩ CC s MNs CC NΩ C s MNs C Based upon the result that the CC pair represents a rare event  proteins satisfying Ns CC Ns C  as defined in Eq 
  suddenly become interesting 
We can therefore consider the number Ns CC  as an index to develop detection methods to test for the presence of a CC containing protein within a database 
Using this same reasoning  one can also use any other one of the remaining motifs in Table   to develop detection methods for additional proteins In an identical fashion to the previous example using the positive two residue motifs in Table   we can also use any of the  negative  two residue motifs to develop search methods 
For example  the CM pair is a  negative  two residue  word  with  
That is  p CM μ σp C p M 
Using identical arguments to those described in Section   we obtain NΩ CM NΩ M  and NΩ CM NΩ C 
Since both Ns M  and Ns C  are small numbers for fixed proteins  the overall number of CM pairs in most proteins should be close to zero 
Therefore  we can also use any of the remaining seven  negative  motifs in Table   to develop additional detection methods In contrast to the CC motif  the total number of proteins in the Swiss Prot database having more than one CM pair is quite small 
For example  among the   proteins contained within this database  the number of proteins such that Ns CM ⩾  is   and the number of proteins satisfying the condition Ns CM ⩾  is only  
For human proteins in Swiss Prot  the total number of proteins containing CM pairs is   and there are only   proteins that satisfy Ns CM ⩾   Table  
However  we would expect to find about   proteins having CM pairs in the Swiss Prot database  based upon the amino acid frequencies given in Table   which is greater than the number observed Cysteine rich proteins and the presence of CC pairs in proteins are both concepts that have been studied previously      
If we combine these two concepts and describe them in mathematical terms  we observe that the rates q Ns C Ns and q Ns CC Ns C  describe these two conditions  where Ns  Ns C  and Ns CC  are the numbers of all amino acids  cysteine  and CC  respectively 
We can then derive proteinsNs C Ns p C σ Ns CC Ns C p ξτ C ξτ C σ where σ  and σ  are the standard deviations about Ns C Nss Mand Ns CC Ns C s M respectively We have found the following computational results based on Swiss Prot database σ ≈ σ ≈ andp ξτ C ξτ C ⩾ p C For   we have a much simpler method to determine that a protein sequence is both C  and CC rich if proteinsNs C Ns ∩proteinsNs CC Ns C So  a much simpler method to test whether a protein is a both C  and CC rich for   isNumber of CC  Number of C Number of C  Length of protein Using this principle  we found a total of eight proteins that are both C  and CC rich within the Swiss Prot database For   there is an easier method to determine whether a protein sequence is both C  and CC rich if proteinsNs C Ns ∩proteinsNs CC Ns C So  a much simpler method to test whether a protein is both C  and CC rich for   is based on the inequalitiesNumber of CC  Number of C Number of C  Length of protein Using this principle  we can get a total of   proteins that are both C  and CC rich within the entire Swiss Prot database For   there is also an easier method to determine if a protein sequence is both C  and CC rich sequence when proteinsNs C Ns ∩proteinsNs CC Ns C So  a much simpler method to test whether a protein is both C  and CC rich for   is based on the inequalitiesNumber of CC  Number of C Number of C Length of protein Using this principle  we have identified a total of   proteins that are both C  and CC rich within the Swiss Prot database 
From these results  it becomes clear that there are many C rich proteins and many CC rich proteins that are not mutually inclusive 
The sets of both C  and CC rich proteins are only subsets of the set containing all C rich proteins or that containing all CC rich proteins Because the Swiss Prot database is somewhat biased to those proteins that are of interest to researchers  we have decided to examine a database that was  in essence  complete 
For this  we chose the human subset sequences contained within the Complete Human Genebank database 
This was the most complete and readily available source of human genetic sequences and should therefore provide us with an accurate representation of both CC and CM pair distributions 
We observed that the total number of CC pairs within the human subset of sequences contained in Genebank  a total of   proteins  was  
These pairs were contained within a total of   proteins  Table   a number that is substantially larger than the   we obtained from Swiss Prot data  Table  
Since the total number of amino acids in The Complete Human Genebank is   we can easily get the expected number of CC in Complete Human Genebank is   which is much less than this actual value  
The same also holds true for the CM pair  where we would expect to see   CM pairs  but actually observe    Table  
 
This result is surprising but true and shows that there are fundamental difference between the Human and other species in terms of the frequency of CC and CM pairs To create a single CM pair  it is obvious that one needs only a single C  If a protein sequence also contains a CC pair  the total number of cysteines available to create a CM pair has been reduced by a factor of  
Using the cutoff value of four CC pairs as statistically significant  we determined the probability of finding a CM pair within proteins that already contained a CC pair  Table  
Even though both CC and CM can occur in the same protein  the total number of proteins in Genebank that contain both CC and CM pairs is   and these pairs almost always occur at different locations in the sequence 
However  in some rare cases the second C within the CC pair is shared with the first C within the CM pair  giving us a new triplet CCM If we filter the set of proteins described above for redundant entries  we obtain a set of   unique proteins that contain the CCM triplet in the human proteome 
Using the probability distributions obtained from Swiss Prot  we obtained the probability of CCM as  
Since the total of all protein lengths in the Swiss Prot database is   there should be a total of   CCM triplets 
This value is almost identical to the predicted number of CCM of  
This result suggests that the CCM triplet at least in Swiss Prot occurs randomly 
However  we can also analyze the CCM probability using a different approach  putting q CCM p CC p M  into Eq 
 
If CCM occurs randomly  then we have p CCM p C p C p M  and since p CC μ σp C p C  we will get k p q CCM log p CCM q CCM log p C p CC ⩽ μ σ Based on Eq 
  it is clear that the presence of a CC pair strongly excludes M  Therefore  the probability of the CCM triplet should occur less frequently than that of CC or M individually We have obtained the following statistical results with regard to the total number of CC and CM pairs contained in the Swiss Prot database i The total number of these proteins satisfying Ns CC ⩾  is   and   of these are found in humans 
 ii The total number of human proteins in Ω that satisfy Ns CC ⩾  is  
 iii The total number of the proteins in Ω that satisfy Ns CM ⩾  is     of these are found in humans 
 iv The total number of human proteins in Ω that satisfy Ns CM ⩾  is only  
The genome of the SARS associated Coronavirus contains a total of   open reading frames  which code for six characterized and five uncharacterized proteins   
After examining the complete proteome the SARS associated Coronavirus we observed a statistically significant increase in the occurrence of the CC and CM pairs in the SARS associated Coronavirus  genome Of the   putative proteins  four contain either CC or CM pairs 
Two large poly proteins  GI  and GI  contain   CC and   CM pairs  as well as   CC and   CM pairs  respectively 
The putative spike glycoprotein  GI    contains   CC and   CM  while the small envelope protein  GI    contains only   CC pair 
The remaining   proteins  of which two have been identified as a nucleocapsid and matrix protein  contain no CC or CM pairs 
When compared to the occurrence of CC and CM pairs within all human proteins found in the Swiss Prot database  it becomes clear that there is an increased occurrence of these pairs within the SARS associated Coronavirus proteome It is clear that the frequency of CC and CM pairs is significantly higher in the SARS genome than it is in the human genome 
It is our hope that these unique two residue motifs could be used as a means of identifying a virus such as SARS 
While currently impossible to determine  one can see a possible clinical use for determining the frequency of CC or CM pairs in an individual 
If a person has been infected by SARS  we would expect the numbers of CC and CM pairs to be much higher than in a healthy individual 
If we were then able to develop a clinically feasible technique that could identify the CC or CM pair content in total cellular protein  without damaging the cell  it could be possible to implement a detection method simply by counting the numbers of CC or CM pairs in all proteins examined 
If the presence of increased CC or CM pairs was indicative of infection by SARS we could develop new drugs to inhibit the translation of proteins that contain these pairs within infected cells 
As a very specific example  this could be accomplished through the use of specific tRNA mimics that could block translating ribosome when these pairs appear at the P and A site simultaneously      
While tRNA mimics could normally be seen as non specific protein synthesis inhibitors  the lower frequency of the CC or CM motifs in host proteins as compared to the relatively high occurrence in viral protein provide a starting point for the analysis of treatments using methods such as these In this paper we have performed a detailed search of the Swiss Prot and Complete Human Genebank database in relation to the frequencies of each of the   natural amino acids and motifs made up of two residues 
This has provided us with a new insight into the distribution of proteins within these databases and the information that may be contained within a protein s primary amino acid sequence 
Our focus in this quest has been to examine specific pairs or triplets of residues and use probability theory to assess whether or not particular strings of residues occur more frequently than their probability would indicate 
By analyzing affinity and anti affinity  we developed a procedure to search out all two  and three residue clusters within these databases 
Through this technique  we can rapidly classify large groups of proteins into families based on the occurrence of these motifs 
Combining this concept with a specific knowledge of protein function  we propose novel ideas aimed at developing fast detection methods for specific diseases based on the unusually high occurrence of some of these motifs when compared with the expected probabilities 
A timely example of the application of this method is given  namely the analysis of the SARS virus 
This method will hopefully lead to the discovery of new diagnostic techniques and possible treatment of diseases  by recognizing the location of target domains in the expressed sequence Recombination Every Day  Abundant Recombination in a Virus during a Single Multi Cellular Host InfectionAs increasing numbers of full length viral sequences become available  recombinant or mosaic viruses are being recognized more frequently   
Recombination events have been demonstrated to be associated with viruses expanding their host range   or increasing their virulence    thus accompanying  or perhaps even being at the origin of  major changes during virus adaptation 
It remains unclear  however  whether recombination events represent a highly frequent and significant phenomenon in the everyday life of these viruses Viruses can exchange genetic material when at least two different viral genomes co infect the same host cell 
Progeny can then become hybrid through different mechanisms  such as reassortment of segments when the parental genomes are fragmented    intra molecular recombination when polymerases switch templates  in RNA viruses     or homologous or non homologous recombination  in both RNA and DNA viruses 
Quantification of viral recombination in multi cellular organisms has been attempted under two distinct experimental approaches  in vitro  in cell cultures     and in vivo  in live hosts    
The in vitro approach  which has so far been applied only to animal viruses  allows the establishment of the  intrinsic  recombination rate in experimentally co infected cells in cell cultures   
However  it does not necessarily reflect the situation in entire  living hosts  where the frequency of co infected cells is poorly known and depends on many factors such as the size of the pathogen population  the relative frequency and distribution of the different variants  and host defense mechanisms preventing secondary infection of cells 
The in vivo experimental approach is closer to biological conditions and may thus be more informative of what actually happens in  the real world However  as discussed below  numerous experimental constraints have so far precluded an actual quantification of the baseline rate of recombination 
First  many experimental designs have used extreme positive selection  where only recombinant genomes were viable  e g    
Other studies did not use complementation techniques but detected recombinants by PCR within infected hosts or tissues    which provides information on their presence but not on their frequency in the viral population 
So far  no quantitative PCR or other quantitative method has been applied to evaluate the number of recombinants appearing in an experimentally infected live host 
Finally  recent methods based on sequence analysis inferred the population recombination rate  rather than the individual recombination rate   
While results from these methods certainly take in vivo recombination into account  there are other caveats  isolates have often been collected in different hosts sometimes in different geographical regions and sometimes the selective neutrality of sequence variation on which these estimates are based is not clearly established 
Estimates from such studies by essence address the estimation of the recombination rate at a different evolutionary scale Taken together  the currently available information indicates that no viral recombination rate has ever been estimated directly at time and space scales corresponding to a single multi cellular host infection  although this level is most significant for the biology and evolution of viruses 
This study intends to fill this gap by evaluating the recombination frequency of the cauliflower mosaic virus  CaMV  during a single passage in one of its host plants  the turnip Brassica rapa CaMV is a pararetrovirus  which is a major grouping containing hepadnaviruses  e g  hepatitis B virus  badnaviruses  e g  banana streak virus  and caulimoviruses  e g  CaMV 
Pararetroviruses are characterized by a non segmented double stranded DNA genome 
After entering the host cell nucleus  the viral DNA accumulates as a minichromosome   whose transcription is ensured by the host RNA polymerase II   
The CaMV genome consists in approximately   bp and encodes six viral gene products that have been detected in planta  Figure     
Viral proteins P  to P  are expressed from two major transcripts  namely a  S RNA  encoding P  and a  S RNA corresponding to the entire genome and serving as mRNA for proteins P –P    
Using the pre genomic  S RNA as a matrix  the protein P   product of gene V  reverse transcribes the genome into genomic DNA that is concomitantly encapsidated   The detection of CaMV recombinants in turnip hosts has been reported numerous times 
Some studies have demonstrated the appearance of infectious recombinant viral genomes after inoculation  i  of a host plant with two infectious or non infectious parental clones   or  ii  of a transgenic plant containing one CaMV transgene with a CaMV genome missing the corresponding genomic region   
While the former revealed inter genomic viral recombination  the latter demonstrated that CaMV can also recombine with transgenes within the host s genome 
Another study based on phylogenetic analyses of various CaMV strains has clearly suggested different origins for different genomic regions and  hence  multiple recombination events during the evolution of this virus   
Indirect experimental evidence has indicated that  in some cases  CaMV recombination could occur within the host nucleus  between different viral minichromosomes  presumably through the action of the DNA repair cellular machinery   
Nevertheless  the mechanism of  template switching  during reverse transcription  predominant in all retroviruses  most certainly also applies to pararetroviruses 
For this reason  and on the basis of numerous experimental data  CaMV is generally believed to recombine mostly in the cytoplasm of the host cell  by  legal  template switching between two pre genomic RNA molecules    or  illegal  template switching between the  S and the  S RNA   
Under this hypothesis  recombination in CaMV could therefore be considered as operating on a linear template during reverse transcription  with the  ′ and  ′ extremities later ligated to circularize the genomic DNA  position   in Figure  
The above cited studies clearly demonstrate that CaMV is able to recombine 
However  since these studies are based on complementation techniques  non quantitative detection  or phylogenetically based inferences of recombination  they do not inform us on whether recombination is an exceptional event or an  everyday  process shaping the genetic composition of CaMV populations In the present work  we aimed at answering this question 
To this end  we have constructed a CaMV genome with four genetic markers  demonstrated to be neutral in competition experiments 
By co inoculating host plants with equal amounts of wild type and marker containing CaMV particles  we have generated mixed populations in which impressive proportions of recombinants distributed in several different classes corresponding to exchange of different genomic regions have been detected and quantified 
Altogether  the recombinant genomes averaged over   of the population 
Further analysis of these data  assuming a number of viral replications during the infection period ranging from five to   indicates that the per nucleotide per replication cycle recombination rate of CaMV is of the same order of magnitude  i e  on the order of a few   across the entire genome 
We thereby provide the first quantification  to our knowledge  of the recombination rate in a virus population during a single passage in a single host From Figure   and supposing that all marker containing genomic regions can recombine  we could predict the detection and quantification of seven classes of recombinant genotypes   bcd a  a cd b  ab d c  abc d   cd ab  a d bc  and a c b d 
Indeed  all classes were detected  and their frequencies in the ten CaMV populations analyzed are summarized in Table  Altogether  the proportion of recombinant genomes found in the mixed viral populations was astonishingly high and very similar in the ten co infected plants analyzed  Table   last column  ranging between    plant   to    plants     and   with a mean frequency   standard error  of      
This result indicates that recombination events are very frequent during the invasion of the host plant by CaMV and represents  to our knowledge  the first direct quantification of viral recombination during the infection of a live multi cellular host The inferred per generation recombination and interference rates  assuming that CaMV undergoes ten replication cycles during the   d between infection and sampling  are given for each of the ten plants in Table  
Recombination rates between adjacent markers are large  on the order of   to  
Taking the distance in nucleotides between markers into account yields an average recombination rate per nucleotide and generation on the order of      
Interestingly  this recombination rate does not vary throughout the genome  Kruskal–Wallis test  p    To relax the assumption of the number of replications during the   d  we calculated the recombination parameters assuming five or   generations 
The effect of the number of generations on the estimates is linear  doubling the number of generations results in a halving of the recombination rate  detailed results not shown 
For example  the average recombination rates r
  r
  and r
  assuming   generations were equal to     and   respectively  compare with values in Table   yielding per nucleotide per generation recombination rates of             and      Inspection of Table   also shows that first order interference coefficients were in general negative  indicating that a crossing over in one genomic segment increases the probability that a crossing over will occur in another genomic segment  while the second order coefficient parameter had an average value close to zero with a large variance 
The mechanism leading to these results will be discussed in the following section One major breakthrough in the work presented here lies in the space and time scales at which the experiments were performed 
Indeed  the processes occurring within the course of a single infection of one multi cellular host are of obvious biological relevance for any disease 
Previous studies on viral recombination suffered from major drawbacks in this respect  basing their conclusions on experiments relying on complementation among non infectious viruses or between viruses with undetermined relative fitness  on phylogenetically based analyses  or on experiments in cell cultures 
For reasons detailed in the Introduction  the first two methods either do not provide information on the frequency of recombination  but only its occurrence  or address the question at a different temporal  and often spatial  scale 
Results from cell cultures  on the other hand  impose cell co infection by different viral variants  potentially overestimating the frequency of recombination events 
Our study circumvents these limitations by analyzing viral genotypes sampled from infected plants after the course of a single infection  and therefore the invasion and co infection of cells in various organs and tissues is very close to natural More than half of the genomes       see Table   present in a CaMV population after a single passage in its host plant were identified as recombinants  and these data allowed us to infer a per nucleotide per generation recombination rate on the order of       to      
The time length of one generation  i e  the time required for a given genome to go from one replication to the next  is totally unknown in plant viruses 
The only experimental data available on CaMV are based on the kinetics of gene expression in infected protoplasts  where the capsid protein is produced between   and   h   
The reverse transcription and the encapsidation of genomic DNA being two coupled phenomena    we judged it reasonable to assume a generation time of   d and  thus  an average of ten generations during our experiments 
In case this estimate is mistaken  we have verified a linear relationship between r and the number of generations  thereby allowing an immediate adjustment of r if the CaMV generation time is more precisely established 
At this point  we must consider that all cloned genomes may not have been through all the successive replication events potentially allowed by the timing of our experiments 
It was previously shown that about   of CaMV mature virus particles accumulate in compact inclusion bodies    where they may be sequestered for a long time  as such inclusions are very frequent in all infected cells  including those in leaves that have been invaded by the virus population for several weeks 
The viral population may thus present an age structure that could bias the estimation of the recombination rate 
In order to minimize this bias  the clones we analyzed were collected in one young newly formed leaf  where the chances of finding genomes from  unsequestered lines  were assumed to be higher 
In any case  our data analysis is conservative  since this age structure can only lead to an underestimation of the recombination rate Our results show that interferences between pairs of loci are negative  a recombination event between two loci apparently increases the probability of recombination between another pair of loci 
We believe that the most parsimonious explanation of these negative interferences is based on the way the infection builds up within plant hosts 
Indeed  one can divide infected host cells into those infected by a single virus genotype and those infected by more than one viral genotype 
In the former  analogous to clonal propagation  recombination is undetectable 
In the latter  recombination is not only detectable but  as our results indicate  very frequent 
Samples consisting of viruses resulting from a mixture of these two types of host cell infections will thus contain viruses with no recombination and viruses with several recombination events  thus yielding an impression of negative interference 
These conceptual arguments are supported by mathematical models 
It is indeed easy to show  detailed results not shown  that if a proportion F of the population reproduces clonally  analogous to single infections  while the remaining reproduces panmictically  negative interferences could be inferred even if they do not exist 
For example  assuming a three locus model with real recombination rates r
  and r
  and interference i
  the  apparent  recombination and interference parameters  would be r
        F r  r
        F r
  and i
     F   i
    F 
Interestingly  this example also shows that our estimates of the recombination rate are conservative  that a fraction F of host cells are singly infected while others are multiply infected leads to an underestimation of the recombination rate As judged by r
  r
  and r
  calculated between markers a–b  b–c  and c–d  respectively  we found evidence for recombination through the entire CaMV genome 
The values for r
 
r
  and r
  are remarkably similar  hence the recombination sites seem to be evenly distributed along the genome 
We considered the template switching model as the major way recombinants are created in CaMV 
As already mentioned in the Introduction  hot spots of template switching have been predicted at the position of the  ′ extremities of the  S and  S RNAs   
If other recombination mechanisms  such as that associated with second strand DNA synthesis or with the host cell DNA repair machinery  act significantly  hot spots would be expected at the positions of the sequence interruption     and     
Due to the design of our experiment and the position of the four markers  we have no information on putative hot spots at positions corresponding to the  ′ end of the  S RNA and to    at nucleotide position  
Nevertheless  the putative hot spots at the  ′ end of the  S RNA and at   and    nucleotide positions   and   respectively  fall between marker pairs c–d  b–c  and a–b  respectively 
Our results indicate that either these hot spots are quantitatively equivalent though predicted by different recombination mechanisms or  more likely  that they simply do not exist 
Whatever the explanation  what we observe is that the CaMV can exchange any portion of its genome  and thus any gene thereof  with an astonishingly high frequency during the course of a single host infection To our knowledge  the viral recombination rate has never previously been quantified experimentally for a plant virus   
In contrast  retroviruses and particularly HIV  have been extensively investigated in that sense 
As we have already discussed for these latter cases  the quantification of the intrinsic recombination rate was carried out in artificially co infected cell cultures 
The estimated intrinsic per nucleotide per generation recombination rate in HIV  is on the order of      less than one order of magnitude higher than our estimation for CaMV 
Because for various reasons detailed above we probably underestimate the within host CaMV recombination rate  we believe that the intrinsic recombination rate in CaMV is higher and perhaps on the order of that of HIV Other pararetroviruses such as plant badnaviruses or vertebrate hepadnaviruses have a similar cycle within their host cells  including steps of nuclear minichromosome  genomic size RNA synthesis  and reverse transcription and encapsidation 
Nevertheless  vertebrate hepadnaviruses  e g  hepatitis B virus  infect hosts that are very different from plants in their biology and physiology  and this could lead to a totally different frequency of cell co infection during the development of the virus populations 
Thus  even though our results can be informative for other pararetroviruses because of the viruses  shared biological characteristics  they should not be extrapolated to vertebrate pararetroviruses without caution We used the plasmid pCa  which is the complete genome of the CaMV isolate Cabb S  cloned into the pBR  plasmid at the unique SalI restriction site   
To analyze recombination in different regions of the genome  we introduced four genetic markers  a  b  c  and d  at the positions       and   respectively  thus approximately at four cardinal points of the CaMV circular double stranded DNA of   bp  Figure  
All markers  each corresponding to a single nucleotide change  were introduced by PCR directed mutagenesis in pCa  and resulted in the duplication of previously unique restriction sites BsiWI  PstI  MluI  and SacI in a plasmid designated pMark S  Because  in this study  we targeted the possible exchange of genes between viral genomes  all markers a  b  c  and d were introduced within coding regions corresponding to open reading frames I  IV  V  and VI  respectively 
Another important concern was to quantify recombination in the absence of selection  i e  to create neutral markers 
Consequently all markers consist of synonymous mutations  see below To generate the parental virus particles  plasmids pCa  and pMark S were mechanically inoculated into individual plants as previously described   
All plants were turnips  B  rapa cv   Just Right  grown under glasshouse conditions at   °C with a    light dark  photoperiod 
Thirty days post inoculation  all symptomatic leaves were harvested and viral particles were purified as described earlier   The resulting preparations of parental viruses  designated Cabb S and Mark S  were quantified by spectrometry using the formula described by Hull et al 
  
We fixed the initial frequency of markers to a value of   and a solution containing   mg ml of virus particles of both Cabb S and Mark S at a   ratio was prepared 
Plantlets were co infected by mechanical inoculation of two to three leaves with   μl of this virus solution  using abrasive Celite AFA  Fluka  Ronkonkoma  New York  United States 
The mixed CaMV population was allowed to grow during   d of systemic infection We designed an experimental protocol for quantifying marker frequency within a mixed Cabb S Mark S virus population after a single passage in a host plant 
Twenty four individual plants  inoculated as above with equal amounts of Cabb S and Mark S  were harvested   d post inoculation  when symptoms were fully developed 
The viral DNA was purified from   mg of young newly formed infected leaves according to the protocol described previously   
After the precipitation step of this protocol  the viral DNA was resuspended and further purified with the Wizard DNA clean up kit  Promega  Fitchburg  Wisconsin  United States  in TE  X   mM Tris HCl and   mM EDTA  pH   
Aliquots of viral DNA preparations were digested by restriction enzymes corresponding either to marker a  b  c  or d and submitted to a   agarose gel electrophoresis  colored by ethydium bromide and exposed to UV 
Each individual restriction enzyme cut once in Cabb S DNA and twice in Mark S  thus generating DNA fragments of different sizes attributable to one or the other in the mixed population of CaMV genomes 
After scanning the agarose gels  we estimated the relative frequency of the two genotypes in each viral DNA preparation and at each marker position  by densitometry using the NIH   Image program 
The statistical analyses of the frequency of the four markers are described below To identify and quantify the recombinants within the CaMV mixed populations  aliquots from ten of the   viral DNA preparations described above were digested by the restriction enzyme SalI  and directly cloned into pUC  at the corresponding site 
In each of the ten viral populations analyzed    full genome length clones were digested separately by BsiWI  PstI  MluI  and SacI  to test for the presence of marker a  b  c  and d  respectively 
In this experiment  with the marker representing an additional restriction site  we could easily distinguish between the Cabb S and the Mark S genotype at all four marker positions  upon agarose gel   electrophoresis of the digested clones 
Clones with none or all four markers were parental genotypes  whereas clones harboring     or   markers were clearly recombinants 
Due to the very high number of recombinants detected  markers eventually appearing or disappearing due to spontaneous mutations were neglected Here we present the different methods we used to quantify recombination in the CaMV genome 
Because all these methods assume that the different markers are neutral  we first discuss assumption We used two datasets to test the neutrality of markers  both resulting from plants co infected with a   ratio of Mark S and Cabb S 
The first consisted of viral DNA densitometry data derived from   plants  described above  where for each plant we have an estimate of the frequency of each marker in the genome population 
The second consisted of the restriction of   individual full genome length viral clones obtained from one co infected plant  described above  yielding an estimate of the frequency of each marker  and this was repeated on ten different plants 
The frequencies of the different markers were       and   for markers a  b  c  and d in the first dataset and       and   in the second dataset 
We tested whether these frequencies were significantly different from the expected value under neutrality    using either t tests  for datasets where normality could not be rejected  seven out of eight cases  or Wilcoxon signed rank non parametric tests otherwise  marker c in the first dataset 
In all cases p values were larger than  There are several cautionary remarks regarding these analyses 
First  in all cases we found an excess of markers 
Unfortunately  the two datasets cannot be regarded as independent because  even though the methods through which the frequency estimates were obtained were different  the plants used in the second dataset were a subset of the plants of the first 
We thus have only four independent estimates in each case  and there is minimal power to detect significant deviations from neutrality with such a small sample size 
It should be noted at this stage that deviations from the expected value could also be caused either by slight deviations from the   ratio in the infecting mixed solution  or by deviations from that ratio in the frequency of the viral particles that actually get into the plants 
Second  because of the relatively small sample sizes and low statistical power  the tests presented above could have detected only large deviations The results clearly show  however  precisely that the markers do not have large effects  if any  and that therefore recombination estimates would be affected only very slightly by any hypothetical selective effects of the markers 
Because of this  along with the fact that the introduced markers provoke silent substitutions in the CaMV genome  we assumed that markers were effectively neutral in the rest of the analysis The dataset used to estimate the recombination frequency consisted of the   full genome length viral clones   from each of ten co infected plants  individually genotyped for each of the four markers 
As discussed in detail in the Results  recombination was very frequent and concerned all four markers 
Indeed  approximately half of the genotyped clones exhibited a recombinant genotype 
It was therefore meaningful to try to obtain quantitative estimates of recombination from our data Our aim was to analyze viral recombination in a live host 
Consequently  we had to deal with the fact that more than one viral replication cycle occurred during the   d that infection lasted in our experiment  we had to wait that long for the disease to develop and to be able to recover sufficient amounts of viral DNA from each infection 
Based on the kinetics of gene expression    we postulate that each replication cycle lasts between   and   d  and that therefore seven to ten cycles occurred between infection and the sampling time 
In case this assumption is incorrect  we did calculations assuming five  seven  ten  or   replication cycles during these   d  As shown  the results were not affected qualitatively  and only slightly quantitatively 
It is important to note that we assumed that recombination occurred through a template switching mechanism  and that therefore  from a recombination point of view  the CaMV genome is linear 
The reverse transcription starts and finishes at the position   in Figure   which is the point of circularization of the DNA genome 
This implies that changes between contiguous markers a–b  b–c  and c–d can be considered as true recombination whereas those between a and d cannot  as they may simply stem from circularization of DNA  during the synthesis of which the polymerase has switched template once anywhere between a–b  b–c  or c–d To estimate the recombination rate between markers  we wrote recurrence equations describing the change in frequency of each genotype over one generation  assuming random mating and no selection  i e  the standard Wright–Fisher population genetics model 
We then expressed the frequency of all possible genotypes n generations later as a function of their initial frequency and of the recombination parameters 
Subsequently we calculated the maximum likelihood estimates of the recombination parameters and their asymptotic variances given initial frequencies  we assumed that the two  parental  genotypes  Mark S and Cabb S  had equal initial frequencies of   and that all other genotypes had initial frequencies of zero  and frequencies after n generations  the observed frequencies  as stated above we used different values of n 
All algebraic and numerical calculations were carried out with the software Mathematica The recombination parameters are the recombination rates between two adjacent loci  e g  r
  for the recombination rate between markers a and b  and the interference coefficients  e g  i
  for interference between recombination events in the segments between markers a and b and b and c  To define these parameters we followed Christiansen    and in particular the recombination distributions for two  three  and four loci  respectively  Tables     and   of   
It is important to realize that given the definitions of these parameters  the estimator of the recombination rate between two loci is not affected by the number of loci considered 
In other words  we obtain the same estimation of the recombination rate between markers a and b whether we consider genotypic frequencies at just these two loci  or the frequencies at these two loci plus a third locus  or the complete information to which we have access  the four marker genotypes 
Information on additional loci only affects the estimates of the interference coefficients It proved impossible to carry out the calculations for four loci algebraically 
Instead  we used a computer program to calculate the expected genotypic frequencies at all four loci after n generations  given the above stated initial frequencies and specified recombination parameters 
For each combination of recombination parameters we calculated a Euclidean distance between the vector of the expected genotypic frequencies and the observed genotypic frequencies  and considered that the estimated recombination parameters were those yielding the minimal Euclidean distance 
In all cases  the estimated recombination rates between pairs of loci were equal to the second decimal to those estimated algebraically from data for three or two loci Tumor Restrictions to Oncolytic VirusIn most solid tumors the tumor interior displays a high cellular density with multiple cell types  both malignant and normal  stromal  cells  interdigitated by strands of extracellular matrix  ECM  and other poorly defined tissue 
Stromal cells typically consist of fibroblasts  macrophages  neutrophils and other immune cell types 
Tumor associated fibroblasts are a source of the bulk acellular tissue in tumors    which is largely made up of polysugars and glycoproteins  such as collagens  laminins  fibronectins  proteoglycans  hyaluronan and water  forming a dense matrix around and between the cancer cells   
This matrix provides structural support but also haptotactic and chemotactic guidance for cancer cells   
Moreover  the prevailing tumor interstitium is rich in soluble angiogenic factors  such as members of the vascular endothelial growth factor  VEGF  family    cellular growth factors  including endothelial growth factor  EGF  basic fibroblast growth factor  FGF  platelet derived growth factor  PDGF  and pleiotrophic factors  particularly transforming growth factor  TGF  beta   
Additionally  both tumor  and stromal cells secrete cytokines and chemokines  such as interleukin  IL    IL   tumor necrosis factor  TNF  alpha  stromal cell derived factor  SDF    macrophage migration inhibitory factor  MIF    which on one hand recruit more stromal and progenitor cells into the tumors and on the other hand curb the activity of antigen presenting cells and anti tumor T cells   
In several independent cancer types  high serum levels of IL   and IL   are indicators of poor prognosis   Aberrant tumor and stromal growth combined with an overproduction of matrix leads to high interstitial pressure in the tumor  preventing lateral diffusion of therapeutic compounds within the tumor 
Tight cellular compactness combined with a high tumor proliferation rate also causes physical crowding and puts constraints on oxygenation  which due to aberrant angiogenesis and rupture of the haphazard vessels is mostly incomplete and results in chronic tissue hypoxia toward the tumor cores 
As cancer cells exist in a crowding hypoxic  and cytokine growth factor perpetuated chronic state of stress  they upregulate a number of key cellular molecules that function as a collective defense against a wide range of therapies  including oncolytic viruses 
The properties of oncolytic viruses and their status in clinical development as well as various delivery options have been reviewed elsewhere   
In this review  we provide an overview of two of the main intratumoral barriers to oncolytic virus spread  the extracellular tumor make up and the intracellular antiviral defense mechanisms Tumor cellular structure and composition may in concert with abundant extracellular matrix  ECM  deposition pose a severe hurdle for systemic virus entry and propagation of infection within the tumor 
The extracellular matrix is a complex dense network consisting of multiple proteins  glycoproteins and polysaccharides including collagens  laminins  fibronectins  proteoglycans and hyaluronic acid   
The interstitial fluid pressure  IFP  in the tumor surrounding blood and lymphatic vessels is mainly created by the high cell density that forms an increased physical pressure outwards and does not allow free diffusion of therapeutics   
A high IFP generally predicts an aggressive tumor phenotype as tumor cells tend to escape from tumor margins where the pressure drops  thus facilitating spread of metastatic cells   
On the other hand  for therapeutic virus  interstitial fluid concentration gradients may pose a hurdle as passive diffusion in viable regions  typically the rim  may occur mainly outward   
Given the limited arsenal of known chemicals alleviating tumor compactness and the poor penetration drugs in general into the tumor tissue  this is a considerable problem that may not be easy to tackle 
Some strategies are discussed below Viruses are passive particles and rely either on radial cell to cell spread or on soluble diffusion across concentration gradients to reach their target cells and to propagate the infection 
Tumor matrix is critical in this regard  as it can block both forms of spread 
Passively diffusing viruses may physically not fit through the strands of the ECM 
This was shown for oncolytic herpes virus  which has an outer diameter of over   nm  and whose spreading could be improved by matrix degrading bacterial collagenase co injection   
Bilbao and coworkers showed that adenovirus entry into experimental hepatocellular carcinoma nodules in the livers of immunocompetent rats following intravenous or intraportal injection was directly related to the thickness of the ECM capsule enveloping the nodules   
On the other hand  we found using Semliki Forest virus  which has an outer diameter of about   nm  that even upon intratumoral injection spread was blocked by ECM  which formed a physical barrier for virus infection  Figure  The foremost option to reduce interstitial fluid pressure and to remove physical molecule barriers imposed by the ECM is to use matrix degrading enzymes 
These act by digesting collagen  fibrin  and other types of fibrillar matrix deposits  creating more space between cell clusters  and glycosaminoglycan polymers  known to limit fluid movement in tumors 
Simultaneously  such strategies may also expose more cell surface to viruses  increasing the likelihood of infection 
In a study by Kuriyama  trypsin or collagenase dispase was injected into subcutaneous U  and U  glioma xenografts in immunocompromised mice  followed by a reporter adenovirus   
Both types of ECM degrading enzymes increased tumor transduction by the virus  but when doses got too high  transduction efficacy suffered  demonstrating a balance between ECM degradation and oncolytic virus efficacy 
In another study  treatment of PC  tumors with vaccinia virus producing matrix metalloprotease  MMP    resulted in reduction of collagen IV fibrils and increase in virus penetration into tumor  which yielded elevated virus titers   
Hong et al 
targeted orthotopic neuroblastoma xenografts engineered to express MMP  with oncolytic HSV  achieving increased virus distribution compared to control tumors   
Similar results were obtained when human soft tissue sarcoma HSTS T overexpressing MMP  or MMP  were injected with oncolytic HSV   
MMP expressing tumors contained significantly less sulfated glycosaminoglycans compared to control tumors 
Other enzymes and protein effectors  either engineered into virus expression cassettes or provided exogenously  include hyaluronidase  decorin  various other MMPs  and notably relaxin a peptide hormone normally expressed during particular phase of pregnancy that does not possess tissue degrading activity itself  but instead induces a number of key collagen degrading proteases seemingly in a tumor specific manner   
Beyer showed that relaxin expressed by murine stem cells improved trastuzumab penetrance and therapy outcome in syngeneic tumor models   
In another study  chimeric adenovirus Ad  expressing relaxin showed increased tumor transduction and virus dissemination   Several other strategies to increase penetration of therapeutics in tumors have been developed   
While the stromal ECM capsule of tumor nodules acts as a physical barrier to virus entry following intravenous injection  it was possible to improve tumor infection by administering vaso active compounds  angiotensin II  histamine  nitroglycerine  before the virus   
This is interesting  as vasculature per se would not be expected to alter or influence the physical composition of the ECM  such as collagen strand thickness 
Instead  virus access to the tumor was improved  most likely by increased access from the blood via tumor stromal adjoining vessels 
Interestingly  in a study with oncolytic herpes virus  anti VEGF monoclonal antibody Bevacizumab given before intravenous virus injection gave poorer anti tumor efficacy than when given after the virus   
The study showed that while HSV is able to enter and infect tumors better through their leaky vasculature compared to Bevacizumab normalized vasculature  vascular normalization by Bevacizumab still gave superior combination efficacy when the virus was already in the tumor 
This effect was likely dependent on altering both physical and biological properties of the tumor  including interstitial pressure and oxygenation 
In another study  anti VEGF A antibody injections in nude mice harboring U  human glioma xenografts led to an increase in MMP  expression and reduction in collagen fiber content  facilitating improved distribution of oncolytic adenovirus within the tumor tissue   
In general  targeting tumor vasculature by oncolytic viruses and including agents that affect tumor vasculature in combination regimens is gaining interest    and it will be interesting to see more specific studies on how vascular acting agents may affect the physical barriers to oncolytic viruses Some viruses do not need an extracellular step for propagating infection  such as members of the herpes and poxvirus families  and may be able to spread from cell to cell 
For example  HSV  is able to infect neighboring cells via lateral tight junctions in a manner dependent on its glycoproteins E and I   
Vaccinia virus  on the other hand  induces so called actin tails  which are actin filament driven membranous protrusions of the plasma membrane harboring a single virus particle at the outer tip 
These actin tails actively deliver and deposit virus particles onto or even into neighboring cells   
Because lateral spread without an extracellular step may circumvent neutralizing immunity as well as some of the physical obstacles the tumor microenvironment imposes  this ability has been engineered into viruses that normally do not possess it 
A promising strategy is to engineer OVs to express membrane fusogenic genes  MFGs  such as gibbon ape leukemia virus  GALV  glycoprotein  reptilian reovirus p  protein  FAST  or the membrane glycoproteins H and F of measles virus   
Quite intriguingly  expression of several different MFGs by oncolytic adenovirus synergized with chemotherapy in anti tumor efficacy both in vitro and in vivo    suggesting that membrane fusion facilitated lateral spread of also chemotherapeutics  which otherwise would not have occurred in a compact tumor 
The potential limitation of cell to cell dependent spread  however  may be that membrane free physical barriers  such as the ECM  may still pose a barrier to spread 
Also  it is unclear whether MFGs or other mechanisms of lateral spread may assist in reaching distant tumor nests Some other strategies to alleviate matrix imposed restrictions to oncolytic viruses have been discussed elsewhere   Tumors of epithelial origin mostly retain the firm cellular integrity seen in their original adhesive intercellular configuration 
Several viruses use cellular receptors which are located in paracellular tight junctions  which may be problematic in tightly packed tumors   
Adenovirus C group viruses use coxsackie adenovirus receptor  CAR  as their primary entry point  whereas adenovirus B  group members and measles virus Edmonston use CD  complement binding molecule as their cellular receptor   
Adenovirus B  group  serotypes       and   entry occurs using desmoglein   DSG    
Of these  CAR and DSG  are preferentially located within tight junctions and are hidden from virus binding   
Also the complement receptor CD  was ascribed a role in maintenance of epithelial cell integrity by interactions with the E cadherin catenin network   
These observations imply that before reaching the potential entry site on the tumor cell the virus must find its way into the junctional space 
Moreover  it has become increasingly clear that for example glioma tumors traditionally targeted by Ad  serotype adenoviruses often express only low levels of CAR and instead much higher levels of CD    Beyond that tight junctions hide multiple virus receptors  they contain a network of adhesion molecules  including ZO  cadherins  claudins and occludin  which  if perturbed  is associated with more aggressive disease in many types of cancer   
Since tight junctions also contain important receptors that mediate tumor promoting signaling and which have been targeted by monoclonal antibodies  notably Her  it would be highly useful to develop strategies that temporarily loosen the tight junction contacts even at cost of a transient increase in tumor metastatic risk 
One of the most interesting approaches has been to exploit the natural propensity of adenovirus serotype   which as part of its natural life cycle creates dodecahedral particles  PtDd  consisting of viral capsid proteins  penton base and fiber that open tight junctions by binding to and dissolving desmoglein  dimers and reducing E cadherin expression  to develop a specific tight junction opening molecule  JO    
Adenovirus type   uses PtDds to promote its own infection  opening the tight junctions ahead of infection to maximize access to desmoglein 
Analogously  when administered to human tumor xenografts  JO  facilitated penetration of trastuzumab much deeper into the tumor tissue than when the monoclonal antibody was administered on its own   
Moreover  JO  synergized with several chemotherapeutics in solid tumor models   
Backed by our own findings with oncolytic SFV  showing that both extracellular matrix and tumor cell compactness restrict virus spread and oncolytic efficacy  we believe combination approaches that target both tight junctions and extracellular matrix will prove effective in future virotherapy development  Figure  An alternative approach to increasing tumor penetration by oncolytic viruses is to alter tumor cell morphology and status 
Notably  cell death and in particular the type of cell death induced by virus has been shown to affect virus distribution within a tumor mass  in a study by Nagano et al  administration of apoptosis inducing paclitaxel before injecting oncolytic herpes simplex virus increased virus dissemination in the tumor  allowing its diffuse in  tunnels  created by shrinking dying tumor cells   Maintenance of physiological adherence is essential for proper ECM function and for retaining cellular integrity 
Therefore  a potential caveat of using ECM degrading proteolytic enzymes or tight junction openers is the risk of neoplastic cell detachment from the tumor ECM and increased risk of metastasis 
While ECM degradation or tight junction opening may operate innocuously  there is also a chance that loss of E cadherins via proteases or via non specific deregulation of tight junction integrity during ECM modulating therapy could trigger pro tumorigenic Wnt β catenin signaling  possibly driving epithelial to mesenchymal transition   
One study showed that ectopic relaxin expression stimulated MMP expression and enhanced breast cancer invasiveness    whereas another paper found short term relaxin exposure to increase breast cancer cell motility whereas long term expression reduced both motility and cancer invasiveness   
In the context of oncolytic viruses  Lavilla Alonso tested several proteases  including hyaluronidase  relaxin  and macrophage metalloelastase  and showed they all could assist adenovirus entry into tumors  yet  the authors did not detect treatment induced metastases or increase in tumor invasiveness   
Another strategy possibly balancing some of the putative risks of tight junction disruption could be to use Wnt dependent oncolytic viruses   Tumors are invariably fenestrated by host fibroblasts  myeloid cells and other non transformed cells  which driven by cancer induced cues can adopt various reprogrammed phenotypes to promote tumor angiogenesis and growth and to alter tumor responses to therapies   
As most of them normally play a role in immune homeostasis and pathogen sensing  they also respond to and influence oncolytic virus infection of tumors Fulci et al 
reported that injection of oncolytic HSV  directly into glioblastoma tumor parenchyma triggered upregulation of CD  and CD  monocytic markers and rapid clearance of virus  likely executed by infiltrating phagocytic cells   
When clodronate liposomes were used to deplete macrophages in vivo  the authors observed a  fold increase in virus titers in the brain tumors concomitant with an   reduction in peripheral CD  macrophages in animal spleens  suggesting that CD  cells migrate into the tumors upon virus injection and limit overall oncolytic efficacy 
While CD  cells were not reduced by peripheral macrophage depletion  arguing that these cells had been recruited to the tumors before the treatment  they could be eliminated in live glioma slices ex vivo  resulting in a  fold increase in virus replication 
Macrophages may secrete antiviral type I interferon constitutively at very low  subnanomolar  levels   and recently Liu et al 
showed that tumor resident CD  macrophages induced a protective antiviral state in ovarian and breast tumors which led to resistance to oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus  VSV  infection   
Type I IFN signaling  JAK  inhibitor Ruxolitinib reversed the resistance  facilitating VSV replication in the macrophage protected cancer cells 
It is tempting to speculate that tumor resident macrophages also rendered syngeneic GL  and DBT mouse gliomas completely refractory to VA  oncolytic alphavirus  as these cells were quite infectable in vitro and live glioma slices regained their sensitivity to virus within   h  indicating dilution of IFN I   Macrophages or the closely related myeloid suppressor cells are the predominant stromal cell type in many tumors and are actively recruited during cancer progression   
Heavy macrophage presence in the tumors indicates that such tumors may be resistant to oncolytic virotherapy  unless depleting preconditioning would be used 
Moreover  as part of the early immune response to virus infection  monocytic cells are rapidly recruited to tumors following intratumoral virus injection 
In one study  depletion of either CD b  cells or VEGF secreted by these cells in mice treated with oncolytic HSV  greatly increased oncolytic efficacy  tentatively linking pro tumorigenic and antiviral angiogenic mechanisms   Another key pro tumorigenic signaling employed by many tumors is up regulation of CXCR  the receptor for chemokine CXCL   also known as SDF  and recruitment of stromal cells expressing CXCL  which maintain the tumor and recruit additional cells to support tumor expansion and invasion  such as endothelial cell progenitors which contribute to neovascularization   
Indeed  high CXCR  expression is a negative prognostic factor for many cancers 
Oncolytic vaccinia virus engineered to express a soluble antagonist of CXCR  showed improved intratumoral virus replication  increased vascular disruption and a markedly reduced infiltration of the tumors by putative immune suppressive and tumor promoting stromal cells   
This study highlights how reducing pro tumor stromal cell effects may alleviate antiviral resistance and yield increased overall therapeutic efficacy 
On the other hand  if the paracrine antiviral effects of tumor homing monocytic cells could be selectively abrogated these cells could favorably be used to ferry oncolytic viruses into tumors 
Indeed  a significant delay in metastatic tumor potential was achieved when macrophages were harnessed to deliver a tumor specific oncolytic adenovirus   What is the antiviral status in human cancer 
Recent analyses from different normal cells that occupy the same organ reveal striking functional variation in components of the type I IFN signaling pathway that correlate with the tissue tropism and virulence of some virus strains   
Can similar variation in such components be found in cancer cells  or do cancer cells make an exception Transformed cells undergo selective elimination by the immune system before becoming cancerous  termed immunoediting  based on observations of differential capacity of immunocompetent mice to reject tumors previously grown in immunocompromised hosts versus syngeneic animals   
Cancer cell responsiveness to type I and type II IFNs plays a role during immunoediting  cancer cells that eventually progress to form a tumor display reduced capacity to respond to IFN gamma  which otherwise would upregulate MHC class I molecules and render the tumors amenable to CD  T cell mediated destruction  whereas responsiveness to type I interferon initially helps tumors avoid immune purging during the editing phase and is then irrelevant   
Of note  the anti tumor effects of type I IFN  still exploited today in several cancers  were shown to depend on host NK cells  and mice in which IFNAR was blocked by monoclonal antibody failed to reject even highly immunogenic tumors  as opposed to mice treated with control antibody  who all rejected the immunogenic tumor challenge   
Thus  whereas tumor responsiveness to type I IFN is not predetermined after immunoediting  other factors post immunoediting may influence it In several tumor types  varying levels of expression of components of the type I IFN signaling cascade have been detected  and in some tumor types these components have been found to have prognostic value  whereas in others they do not seem to influence survival   
However  emerging data suggests that antiviral genes may predict poor survival because they increase treatment resistance 
In one study  poor prognosis of several types of cancer due to genotoxic treatment resistance was found to correlate with increased activity of IFN I pathway genes   
In this study  a triad of type I IFN signaling pathway genes  STAT  ISG  and IFIT  formed a pan tumor type negative prognostic factor  and a broader seven gene cluster established negative prognostic criteria for treatment resistant breast cancer 
Treatment resistance was subsequently shown to depend on STAT  signaling  STAT expressing tumor clones were positively selected in animals in vivo  demonstrating increased proliferation and metastatic potential  and STAT expression mediated resistance against genotoxic assault by doxorubicin or ionizing radiation  knockdown of STAT  resulted in lower proliferation rate and metastatic capacity and increased sensitivity to genotoxic stress    
In another study  resistance to epigenetic DNA modifiers  AZA dC  a methyltransferase inhibitor  and LBH  or MGCD  both histone deacetylase  HDAC  inhibitors  was correlated with increased expression of IFN I pathway genes in small lung cancer cells   
Basal IFN related gene expression in several different SML cell lines was upregulated Interestingly  in many cancers  STAT proteins are not phosphorylated and persist in unphosphorylated form  U STAT 
Like its phosphorylated counterpart  U STAT  increases expression of genes contributing to resistance to DNA damaging agents   
While it is currently unknown why cancers may prefer to use unphosphorylated forms  it is known that U STATs activate distinct signals compared to their phosphorylated counterparts 
However  importantly for oncolytic viruses  in many tumors  constant expression and release of type I IFN leads to a constitutively high level of unphosphorylated forms of STAT  STAT  and IRF  which together form an unphosphorylated but functional ISGF like complex that relocalizes to the nucleus and drives expression of a specific set of ISGs distinct from acute IFN I exposure   
These ISGs are sufficient to maintain a functional antiviral defense and they play a critical role in resistance to DNA damaging agents On a cellular level  virus replication is controlled by antiviral defense molecules    which in turn are primarily controlled by type I IFN signaling 
In addition to classical type I IFN  or cytokine induced antiviral signaling  tumors may employ other antiviral defense mechanisms 
For example  stromal cells may secrete peptides with antiviral properties called defensins   
The defensins are amphiphatic and typically  –  amino acids in length and interfere with viruses by physically binding to and disrupting virus particles and or by inducing antiviral responses in target cells via pattern recognition receptors 
At least oral squamous cell carcinomas were found to overexpress defensins compared to normal control tissues   
While the role of defensins in oncolytic virus infection of tumors is unclear  one study showed that the immune stimulating properties of defensins may be exploited to increase overall therapeutic efficacy 
In this study  expression of beta   defensin from a conditionally replicating adenovirus yielded a superior therapeutic entity compared to the unarmed parental virus via enhanced anti tumor immune responses mediated by TLR dependent activation of dendritic cells   In summary  human cancers display varying degrees of expression of antiviral proteins or their signaling regulators at baseline 
Some of these may increase in response to genotoxic anti cancer treatments 
In the next chapter we will highlight some of the consequences to oncolytic virotherapy of the heterogeneity in type I IFN responsiveness in tumor cells All oncolytic viruses tested to date display variable infectivity in different cancer cell lines 
This variability is likely at least partly dependent on type I IFN as most oncolytic viruses are IFN sensitive 
IFN secretion follows virus sensing by the cells via Toll like receptors expressed on both the plasma membrane and in endocytotic vesicles  NOD like receptors  STING  AIM  NLP inflammosome and other danger sensing molecules  summarized elsewhere   
While all viruses carry an arsenal of counteracting molecules    no virus goes completely undetected 
Even HSV amplicons  which are devoid of functional virus genes  induce a type I IFN response that mediates a STAT dependent system wide antiviral defense in mice within one hour of intravenous vector injection  resulting in significant reduction of transgene expression compared to expression in STAT  knockout animals   During our own studies with attenuated SFV vector VA  it became apparent that the dramatic and lasting therapeutic efficacy achieved following mere single intravenous  or intratumoral  injection of the virus in immunocompromised mice bearing human A  melanoma or U  glioma xenografts   was not going to be recapitulated easily in immunocompetent animals   
The paradox in our studies was that while oncolytic SFV vector VA  effectively replicated in and destroyed a variety of IFN responsive cancer cell lines in vitro  it consistently failed to eradicate tumors generated from the same cell types in vivo  even if large doses of virus were injected directly into the tumor mass and even if the tumors were void of visible physical barriers  Figure  
Conversely  only tumors generated from IFN unresponsive cancer cells have seemed infectable in vivo by VA  so far 
In light of earlier findings by others  showing that type I IFN receptor knockout mice are highly susceptible to SFV infection and quickly succumb to multi organ systemic infection    the parameters for oncolytic SFV efficacy seem clear  tumor cells must be defective in type I IFN response for the virus to be effective These findings are in line with emerging data from other groups  showing a remarkably strict dependence of oncolytic virus replication on defective type I IFN responsiveness  a dogma introduced at the turn of the  st century   
For example  sarcomas and melanomas display differing permissiveness to oncolytic VSV  an obstacle which may be overcome by blocking type I IFN signaling   
In eight sarcoma cell lines  basal up regulation of RIG I and IFIT  and rapid induction of STAT  phosphorylation upon IFN I treatment correlated with resistance to oncolytic measles virus   
In other studies  human pancreatic and ovarian cancer cells display resistance against Rb dependent oncolytic adenovirus  strongly correlating with intracellular levels of MxA  and acquired resistance to repeated oncolytic adenovirus injections in an intraperitoneal ovarian carcinoma model was associated with an increase in MxA as well as several other key ISGs in the tumors   
A study comparing normal human or mouse melanocytes to a panel of melanoma cells revealed strong correlation between permissiveness to oncolytic VSV and capacity to mount antiviral defense in response to type I IFN   
In this study  VSV rp  harboring two mutations in P and L genes  was superior to several other tested oncolytic VSV strains  but the dependence on defective IFN responsiveness was still retained 
In yet another study  oncolytic VSV replicated in four out of twelve mesothelioma cell lines which were unable to mount antiviral defense upon IFN beta pretreatment or to respond to infection by up regulation of PKR  MxA or  OAS mRNA   
In contrast  the non permissive mesothelioma cells mounted antiviral defense  associated with PKR  MxA or  OAS mRNA up regulation  in response to infection or to exogenous type I IFN 
The authors of this study further linked the observed pattern of virus resistance to clinical mesothelioma samples  where in a mesothelioma tissue array  significant variance in immunoreactivity against PKR  p  and or IFNAR was observed  with only a few samples displaying lack of reactivity against all three components  arguing that most tumors in clinical settings would display at least some level of resistance to oncolytic VSV Oncolytic adenoviruses are often deleted for E A  which normally binds Rb and prevents it from sequestering E F  which results in the viruses being unable to replicate in normal cells 
However  since adenovirus  as with all viruses  contains elements that antagonize antiviral defenses  such elements have also been targets for deletion to render the virus sensitive to innate antiviral defenses  which would be expected to remain intact only in normal cells 
Cancer cells expressing Ras may down regulate protein kinase R and inhibit type I IFN induction by interfering with RIG I signaling   
Also  select interferon stimulated genes appear to be repressed by the Ras MEK ERK signaling cascade   
PKR activation shuts down E F dependent translation  including translation of virus messenger RNAs 
Therefore  an adenovirus deleted for VA RNA  which antagonizes PKR  should be capable of replicating in Ras overexpressing  tumor  cells 
However  while this was seemingly the case    it was later discovered that Ras is not an obligatory determinant for PKR inactivation and that virus replication was halted even in Ras overexpressing cells via functional PKR mediated E F phosphorylation  implying that the parameters of VA RNA deleted adenovirus replication had to be revised   
Similar findings were obtained with oncolytic reovirus  against which Ras independent tumor resistance emerged in vivo   
Thus  under some circumstances even tumor cells over expressing Ras may respond to type I IFN or to stimulants of pattern recognition receptors  activating PKR and inhibiting virus translation 
To complicate matters  MEK inhibitors have been shown restore antiviral signaling capacity in Ras overexpressing tumors   
This implies that human tumors treated with MEK inhibitors  such as Trametinib which was recently approved for treatment of BRAF mutated melanoma  may be poor targets for oncolytic viruses as antiviral signaling capacity in such tumors may be restored Some oncolytic viruses  such as members of the poxvirus family  are seemingly resistant to the antiviral effects of type I IFNs in vitro and may be controlled by other cellular factors   
However  in most cases  sensitivity or resistance to type I IFN is assessed in vitro and using only one cytokine  which may mask synergies with other factors present in vivo 
One possible explanation for the in vitro–in vivo discrepancy is the tumor micro environment  which not only imposes physical barriers to oncolytic viruses but also alters intracellular antiviral defenses 
For example  glioma cells were found in the brain to spontaneously secrete type I IFN  which conferred resistance against oncolytic HSV 
Resistance was linked to ECM protein CCN  interaction with glioma cell surface receptor alpha   beta   integrin  which activated interferon secretion   
It is tempting to speculate whether this or a similar ECM glioma interaction could have contributed to the resistance of syngeneic glioma cells we observed in vivo but not in vitro to both oncolytic SFV and vaccinia virus  FIG    
Also  while critical in many respects  antiviral signaling may occur without signaling via type I IFN receptor  IFNAR 
For instance  upon infection of IFNAR KO mice with murine hepatitis virus  MHV  brain cells were found to have upregulated antiviral GTPase TGTP and IFITm  and IFITm  all of which have confirmed antiviral activity in vivo against a variety of viruses   
In these cases  IFN gamma and TNF alpha likely account for at least part of the observed ISG activity  where e g  TGTP is upregulated by IFN γ signaling and TNFα has been shown to induce ISG  independently of IFNAR   Interestingly  while most cancers are heterogeneous in antiviral defence signaling  one broad class of tumors in particular may display consistently low capacity to ward off oncolytic viruses  oncovirus induced cancers 
This is because oncoviruses  as all viruses  carry a complement of factors that abrogate antiviral sensors and effectors  which may result in tumors that are uniformly devoid of antiviral signaling 
In an intriguing study  oncolytic VSV infected and destroyed human papilloma virus  HPV positive cervical carcinoma cells more effectively than HPV negative head  and neck cancer cells due to HPV E mediated suppression of antiviral signaling   
HPV positive or E expressing xenografts were efficiently eradicated from nude mice following VSV injection 
The potential of this approach is that even oncolytic viruses that are extremely sensitive to type I IFN  such as attenuated SFV or M mutated VSV  may function well against oncovirus induced cancers where the oncovirus machinery ensures the lack of antiviral defense While on first thought it would appear counterintuitive to antagonize the very factors that keep oncolytic viruses tumor specific  emerging data shows that this can be accomplished in a safe way 
One of the foremost strategies to increase oncolytic virus efficacy is to combine them with drugs that lower tumor antiviral defenses 
In this regard  a primary target for interference is the prototypical type I IFN signaling cascade 
While small molecular inhibitors against IFNAR are not available  activity of downstream signaling transducers may effectively be blocked 
Human pancreatic cancer cells were shown to constitutively express high levels of MxA and OAS and to mount type I IFN dependent resistance to oncolytic VSV 
Resistance could be overcome by blocking activity of IFNAR associated Janus kinase  JAK      
Similarly  JAK  inhibitor ruxolitinib overcame type I IFN dependent resistance of human SCC  head and neck cancer cells against oncolytic VSV   
Ruxolitinib also successfully abrogated type I IFN mediated antiviral effects elicited by macrophages    highlighting that this drug might also alleviate type I IFN dependent tumor resistance to oncolytic viruses imposed by stromal cells 
However  the obvious downside to using JAK inhibitors is their effects on critical host defense mechanisms  which may result in increased infection of normal cells 
Moreover  JAK inhibitors may reduce anti tumor immune responses elicited by oncolytic virotherapy 
For example  ruxolitinib was shown to impair the capacity of dendritic cells promote CD  T cell responses against model tumor antigens   
On the other hand  in this study clearance of adenovirus was delayed in ruxolitinib treated normal animals  which makes it difficult to predict the overall impact of JAK inhibitors on tumor therapy where prolonged virus presence might translate to better therapeutic efficacy 
Also  while the immune stimulating and anti tumor effects of type I and type II interferons may be adversely affected by JAK inhibitors  central tumor promoting cascades mediated by JAKs  such as IL STAT  may also be inhibited    yielding a difficult to predict net therapeutic outcome 
At the moment  more studies are needed to establish the overall impact of interference with JAK  signaling in cancer therapy Spurred by earlier reports of oncovirus reactivation and promoter enhancement by histone deacetylase  HDAC  inhibitors  this class of agents was assessed for capacity to enhance oncolytic virus potency by inhibiting antiviral responses 
Indeed  such enhancement was observed with oncolytic VSV and SFV  and while it has been difficult to pinpoint the exact mechanisms that underlie HDAC inhibitor enhancement of oncolytic virus replication in cancer cells  antiviral defenses in general are inhibited for yet unknown reasons mainly in cancer cells and not in normal cells  which indirectly facilitates virus replication   
Interestingly  combination of HDAC inhibitors with conditionally replicating   E A deleted adenovirus gave improved virus replication rate and therapeutic efficacy in subcutaneous xenograft models only when the inhibitors were given before the virus  otherwise inhibition of replication was observed   
Similarly  HDAC inhibitors increased replication and oncolytic efficacy of HSV when given before the virus but not when given at the same time   
With nuclear DNA viruses  such as adenovirus and HSV  it is possible that HDAC inhibitors also alter virus genome accessibility to transcription factors  resulting in reduced replication or other adverse effects  implying that with these viruses HDAC inhibitors should be administered before the viruses Recently  it was found that HDAC inhibitor vorinostat activates NfκB signaling by facilitating hyperacetylation of the p  subunit  which in turn activates cellular autophagy   
Autophagy was in another study shown to be important for VSV replication  presumably by inhibiting antiviral signaling 
This is interesting  as a previous study revealed enhancement of VSV replication by inhibiting TNF alpha induced antiviral signaling mediated by p  using NfκB inhibitors BMS  or TPCA    
In this study  neither inhibitor had an effect on STAT  or STAT  phosphorylation or their nuclear relocalization in response to type I IFN but the authors observed clear induction of ISG  GBP  and MX  in response to type I IFN in U  glioma cells  with the latter two being dependent on NfκB signaling 
Taken together  NfκB pathway activation may result in different antiviral responses in different cancer types  and inhibition or enhancement of oncolytic viruses by NfκB inhibitors is dependent on other concomitant cellular mechanisms  such as autophagy Since HDAC inhibitors modulate promoter activity accessibility  it is conceivable other epigenetic or promoter modifying agents could work in a similar manner to repress antiviral defense induction and enhance oncolytic viruses   
DNA demethylating agents  azacytidine  Aza  and decitabine synergized with oncolytic herpes simplex type   virus in glioma models in vitro and in vivo  as did HDAC inhibitor valproic acid  VPA  which was already shown before to work well with oncolytic HSV as well as several other oncolytic viruses   
Moreover  inhibition of cancer antiviral defenses  specifically RNAseL and PKR  resulted when cancer cells were exposed to sunitinib  a multi tyrosine kinase inhibitor originally developed as an inhibitor of VEGF R and PDGF R signaling  yielding strong anti tumor synergy with IFN sensitive oncolytic VSV   
Since sunitinib is approved for renal cell carcinoma and imatinib resistant gastric cancers  combination with oncolytic VSV constitutes a promising and clinically relevant approach warranting further investigation 
Interstingly  sunitinib as well as several other receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors displayed antiviral effects against polyomavirus BK    arguing that these compounds are not universal virus enhancers Cyclophosphamide  CPA  is a general immunosuppressant used to minimize Treg presence during immunotherapy and also oncolytic virotherapy 
CPA may  however  also enhance replication and efficacy of oncolytic viruses by diminishing cytokine secretion by stromal cells  including type I IFN   
Another compound enhancing oncolytic virus efficacy by lowering cell responsiveness to type I IFN is triptolide  which acts downstream of IRF  activation   
Further  the kinase mammalian target of rapamycin  mTOR  enhances the antiviral effects of type I IFN by activation of its effector proteins  E BP  which binds and inactivates translation factor eIF E  and S K  which carries out cell type specific signaling functions of type I IFN  such as activation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor  B and promotion of ISG  transcription 
Consequently  rapamycin was able to enhance oncolytic VSV replication and anti tumor efficacy by inhibiting type I IFN mediated antiviral signaling via mTOR   Several other compounds synergizing with oncolytic viruses have been identified via high throughput drug library screening  many of which seem to act by antagonizing antiviral defenses 
For instance  a novel virus sensitizer  Vse  was found to greatly diminish antiviral effects of type I IFN against oncolytic VSV in several cancer cell types  and the drug also synergized with the virus in subcutaneous mouse tumor models   
For many of these new compounds  the mechanism of action is still poorly understood  necessitating extensive safety studies to exclude undesirable effects against normal cells Apart from classical type I IFN induced antiviral defenses  which typically prevent virus translation and degrade virus genomes  other cellular machineries regulate oncolytic virus efficacy 
Notably  strategies to increase cancer cell death in response to oncolytic viruses have been tested 
In a recent study  a class of compounds called SMAC mimetics synergized in several cancer models with oncolytic VSV by removing cancer cell block to apoptosis in response to virus induced type I IFN  TNF α or TRAIL   
Interestingly  since virus infection triggered cytokines act on nearby non infected cells  SMAC mimetics may in combination with oncolytic viruses also cause significant bystander tumor destruction 
Normal cells are not affected by the IFN SMAC mimetic synergy  providing an important safety aspect 
In another study  blocking the ER stress response circuitry triggered by oncolytic rhabdovirus infection by a small molecular inhibitor of serine threonine protein kinase and endoribonuclease IRE α  which was identified in a genome wide siRNA screen  greatly enhanced cytotoxicity via caspase induced apoptosis and increased oncolytic efficacy in refractory tumor models in mice   
This effect was independent on induction or responsiveness to type I IFN 
Conversely  inhibitors of nucleoside transporter   ENT  were discovered from a high throughput screen of enhancers of oncolytic HSV  and to date such inhibitors have not been reported to alter cellular antiviral responses   
Other compounds  such as common chemotherapeutics  and their mechanisms synergizing with oncolytic viruses have been discussed elsewhere for most of them the possible role of antiviral defense antagonism in enhancing oncolytic virus efficacy remains to be studied   Thus  many compounds are available to interfere with tumor antiviral defenses 
The outstanding question for most of them  however  seems to be why such compounds do not render normal cells sensitive to oncolytic viruses 
Elucidation of the exact mechanisms of action and the differences between normal and cancer cells constitute a worthy goal for studies in the near future Already in the  s it became clear that using certain pathogenic wildtype viruses  such as West Nile virus and Bunyamwera virus  in cancer patients would result in off target toxicity   
Characteristic for pathogenic viruses is a greater ability to circumvent or antagonize cellular innate antiviral defenses than attenuated strains 
For example  unlike the prototypical oncolytic reovirus strain type   Dearing  the T L strain of reovirus causes accumulation of IRF  in the nucleus and inhibits activation of a select group of ISGs yet because of this property the T L strain is myocarditic unlike the oncolytic type   Dearing strain   
For these reasons  many oncolytic viruses used today  such as reovirus type   Dearing  oncolytic strains of Newcastle disease virus and M mutated VSV have either a stronger capacity to induce or a weaker capacity to resist antiviral type I IFN than the corresponding wildtype strains   An open question  however  is whether strain specific or virus specific differences that relate to specific components of the cellular antiviral machinery may be exploited for greater anti tumor efficacy  i e  if one virus fails  could another be used in its stead 
While Ras expression was critical for oncolytic reovirus replication in cells overexpressing CUG  oncogene  oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus was unable to replicate in the same cells due to increased activation of STAT  and OASL    
Thus  in these cells reovirus was not affected by STAT  or OASL  and it therefore remains interesting to see which other antiviral effectors may have been lacking in the CUG expressing cells and  conversely  how reovirus and VSV differ in terms of sensitivity to antiviral effectors 
While several oncolytic viruses have been compared to each other in terms of replication rate and cytotoxicity  systematic studies with regard to tumor antiviral defenses have not been conducted As any attenuated virus is likely to replicate effectively only in its own niche  i e  to be restricted by a specific set of ISGs  and as wild type strains may be too toxic for use in humans  a compromise may be achieved by incorporating select elements from wild type viruses into oncolytic virus backbones 
Indeed  several chimeric and recombinant viruses have been generated that harbor specific elements of wild type strains or even of other unrelated viruses in order to better resist cancer antiviral defenses  Table  
As an example of introducing wild type elements into attenuated viruses  Haralambieva reported on a measles virus Edmonston vaccine strain in which P gene was replaced with the counterpart from the wild type IC B strain   
Later  Meng et al 
included N  P  and L genes from wild type measles in Edmonston backbone  producing an enhanced but still safe oncolytic virus   
Edmonston vaccine virus induces a more robust IFN response compared to wild type measles virus partly due to the weaker ability of V protein to suppress MDA mediated activation of IRF  and IFN I induction   
In vivo  P gene encoded proteins  particularly V  control the quality of the cytokine response to measles so that vaccine strains qualitatively induce a stronger inflammatory response compared to WT strains  where WT V protein suppresses multiple cytokine secretion 
V protein short cytoplasmic tail has been shown to bind and inactivate STAT  IRF  MDA  and the Rel homology domain of the NfκB subunit p  but not of p    
Also  V causes LGP  protein to bind and inactivate RIG I    but it seemingly does not interfere with TICAM   TRIF  multiple TLR adaptor  including TLR mediated IFN β induction 
Thus  if cancer and normal cells would differ with regard to TICAM  or IRF  then such a virus could potentially target specifically cancer cells rather than normal cells 
So far  the measles Edmonston WT chimeras have proven safe in animals As an example of heterologous virus constructs  lentogenic Newcastle disease virus engineered to express influenza virus PR   H N  NS  showed enhanced oncolytic efficacy in vivo due to dampening of antiviral responses   
While such a virus did not display enhanced pathogenicity in that study  a mesogenic NDV virus harboring NS  from influenza strain H N  did show increased pathogenicity in chickens as well as an increased ability to replicate in human cells    raising some cautionary warnings for future engineering of similar replicative viruses 
As another example  vaccinia virus soluble type I IFN scavenger B R  NOTE  B R is often used in the literature  has been engineered into both oncolytic HSV and oncolytic rhabdoviruses  resulting in all cases in more effective therapy agents without loss of tumor specificity   
Oncolytic γ  gene deleted HSV was complemented by two different PKR antagonists from human cytomegalovirus  TRS  and IRS  generating a chimera capable of reaching wild type virus replication levels in cancer cells in vitro and in tumor models in vivo   The selection of various viral IFN I antagonists that potentially could be used to augment attenuated oncolytic viruses is vast   
For example  increased replication of several viruses  including HIV  Sindbis virus and E deleted adenovirus in mammalian cells was observed when the cells were engineered to express vaccinia virus E L protein  influenza A virus NS  protein  ebola virus VP  protein or HIV  Tat protein   
The choice of antagonist must primarily be made with safety in mind  but virus specific and cell specific differences in antagonist functions may potentially be exploited rationally when considering the overall combination 
For example  vaccinia virus E L is able to rescue VSV but not EMCV from exogenous IFN  whereas vaccinia virus K L partially rescued EMCV but not VSV   In anticipation of systematic  perhaps bioinformatically guided   super chimera  studies  two or more viruses that may complement each other s shortcomings in antiviral defense antagonism have been considered 
Notably  vaccinia virus was favorably combined with IFN I sensitive oncolytic VSV and SFV  yielding tumor model dependent increases in overall therapy efficacy that were dependent on vaccinia virus antagonism of type I IFN responses  which increased the replication of the IFN sensitive viruses   
Such heterologous virotherapy approaches may also be used to generate immunological synergy  similar to heterologous prime boost vaccination  anti tumor immune responses may be increased due to targeting of the tumor by two different viruses  on two separate occasions  but anti virus immune responses would be generated against different viruses each time  avoiding the problem of neutralizing immunity to and predominance of antivirus immune responses   
Some other ideas explored experimentally include engineering oncolytic viruses to express other oncolytic viruses 
For example  the entire oncolytic parvovirus H  genome was placed under a regulatable promoter in oncolytic adenovirus  resulting in a more effective therapeutic entity than either virus alone without loss of tumor specificity   
The genetic material of Semliki Forest virus replicons has been engineered into adenovirus and vaccinia virus backbones   and several other virus chimeras have been constructed   
However  the effects on tumor antiviral defenses of such a constructs remain to be studied The attribute  oncolytic  implies for a virus that it infects and  indeed  lyses the infected tumor 
This property is primarily tested in vitro in cultured tumor cells 
We have learned  however  that in the native tumor microenvironment in living hosts many viruses are no longer able to infect tumor cells or to kill them even if they manage to infect them 
Tightly packed tumor cells and the network of supportive molecules of the extracellular matrix form a physical barrier to virus particle diffusion 
It has also become evident that the tumor cells themselves may be much more capable of thwarting oncolytic virus advances than previously thought  with some tumor cells residing in a seemingly permanent non permissive antiviral state 
Tumors harbor multiple cell types in addition to the neoplastic cells  which may promote and propagate both physical and cellular virus resistance 
As the efficacy of virotherapy in human cancer patients still falls shy of the achievements in animal models  it appears quite plausible that one or more of the barriers described in this review indeed constitute a real and formidable obstacle for oncolytic virus advancement into routine clinical use 
Fortunately  some of the most difficult barriers have been identified  and a rapidly expanding arsenal of countermeasures is at our disposal 
Our task is now to separate the wheat from the chaff and to systematically evaluate the proposed combination regimens that will yield the best results without compromising patient safety Evidence of prenatal toxicity of herbal based indigenous formulations for sex selection in rat modelsTraditional or indigenous preparations  IPs  are getting considerable attention in global health debates  It continues to be used widely in several countries and its consumption is rapidly increasing 
 
  Many reports have documented the use of such preparations 
For instance  in China  traditional herbal medicines played a critical role during the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome  SARS  In fact  many drugs in modern medicine had their roots in the traditional system of medicine 
Drugs like Penicillin  from Penicillium fungi  and Digoxin  from Digitalis purpurea  are some such examples 
One of the promising therapies for Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus  MRSA  infection is a ninth century treatment for eye infections which is a recipe consisting of garlic and onions  wine  and bile from a cow s stomach brewed in a brass cauldron 
It is however important to note that culture specific practices are not always safe 
Digitalis is a classic example where herbalists use this plant in allopathic treatment strategies  while in some countries such as Britain  law restricts their vast availability  A report from Australia describes the adverse effects of ‘herbal  preparations or IPs  Problems arise when people do not report about the consumption of such preparations assuming that these are devoid of any side effects by virtue of them being natural products  The need for research in this field is huge and scientific research into the quality  safety  molecular effects and clinical efficacy is crucial 
 
 
Pregnancy is considered a time of minimal intervention  and a period when herbal medicines are usually contraindicated  It is reported that many women consume indigenous medicines  that contains Bryonia laciniosa  Quercus infectoria and Putranjiva roxburghii along with other ingredients  during early pregnancy to beget a male child in India 
These preparations  often called sex selection drugs  SSD  contain herbal ingredients but these are off the label prescriptions and hence cannot be certified as ‘herbal  medicines 
The prevalence of consumption varies from   to as high as         Studies have indicated that there is  –  times higher risk of birth defects including major malformations of internal organs like urogenital and renal malformation  trachea esophageal fistula  and visible defects like spina bifida  cleft lip palate and imperforate anus 
 
  Risk of stillbirths also increases   folds 
Studies suggest that a single exposure during pregnancy can be deleterious 
 
 
 
  SSDs are reported to contain phytoestrogens  steroids and heavy metals 
 
 
 
  It is also known that although placenta serves as a barrier  most drugs and environmental chemicals enter the foetal circulation by passive diffusion or active transport  However  despite growing evidence on deleterious effects of these herbal formulations  few studies have attempted to systematically understand the risk of such preparations using animal models 
Genetic sex of a child is determined at the time of conception by the fertilization of the ovum with X or Y sperms and intake of so called preparations for sex selection can never alter that In view of these  the current study was conducted with an objective to determine the embryo foetal and development toxicity of SSDs following maternal exposure during critical period of organogenesis using a small animal model The study was guided by the OECD guidelines for testing of chemicals  Guideline no    adopted on  nd January   Prenatal Developmental Toxicity Study  and was based on a mutually approved protocol 
Personal protection equipment was employed as required while handling the test system The test facility is registered and renewed  No 
 PO RcBi S CPCSEA dated July     for breeding and to conduct research on animals for commercial purpose by the committee for the purpose of control and supervision of experiments on animals  CPCSEA  Ministry of Environment  Forests and Climate Change  Government of India 
The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee  Venus Medicine Research Center 
Due permission was taken from the Ethics Committee of Indian Institute of Public Health Delhi For this experiment  strain of Sprague Dawley of rats  Rattus norvegicus  was used 
The number of dams per group was   instead of   as laid down under OECD guidelines 
Rats of both sexes  –  g  were obtained from National Institute of Biologicals  India at  –  weeks of age  acclimatized for five days and then subjected to the experiment at  –  weeks of age 
They were housed in standard polypropylene rat cages with stainless steel top grill  one dam per cage  at a temperature of       °C  with  –  relative humidity 
Bedding material and cages were changed once in six days and   hourly light dark cycle was followed 
Animals were identified by their existing ear numbering 
Cages were labelled by tags indicating the study number  sex  group of the animals  experimental start and completion dates 
Standard pelleted feed  from Ashirwad Industries  Mohali  India  was provided ad libitum to all the animals 
They also had free access to purified water via drinking bottles throughout the study 
The feed  cages and drinking bottles were not analysed for the presence of phytoestrogens and bisphenol A 
However  similar materials were used for all the rats across all groups The drug comprised of IPs for sex selection  SSD 
These non branded locally made preparations are made available  –  days after placing an order and are never sold openly 
These preparations essentially contain herbal ingredients such as Shivlingi  Bryonia laciniosa  Majuphal  Quercus infectoria  Putrajeevak  Putranjiva roxburghii  Nagkesar  Mesua ferrea  and feather of peacock  Pavo cristatus 
A total of   such samples of SSDs were procured from varied sources like ‘pansari  shop owners  grocers  local alternative medicine practitioners  rickshaw pullers  drivers and commoners from different states 
SSDs are advised to be consumed between   and   weeks of pregnancy The samples were categorized into   groups based on redundancy of the preparations and common ingredients reported 
This was followed by chemical analysis in an accredited laboratory to detect the presence of phytoestrogens and steroids 
Since we explored the toxic effects of these preparations we wanted to select two samples that would be most predictive of toxicity 
Due to resource constraints  we did not want to subject all the   samples for animal study 
Hence  three samples of SSDs  found to be most rich in phenols and steroids were selected for toxicity study  All the three samples were also tested for heavy metals which suggested that Lead and Mercury were in very high quantities  The toxicity was examined using C  elegans  an alternate animal model 
Survival analysis and reproductive toxicity was assessed from the brood size and progeny count assay  The two SSDs that were found to be most toxic were selected as test items for the subsequent study in rat models 
SSD   was reported to contain Shivlingi and Putrajeevak while SSD   contained Shivlingi  Majuphal  Putrajeevak  Nagkesar and feathers of peacock 
Both the samples were obtained from grocers 
Local preparations like these are bound to have certain degree of variability in concentrations but more often than not  these remain the major ingredients According to studies reported  women consume such preparations along with cow s milk in dosages and schedule that are quite varied 
While some advise these IPs to be consumed for one day  others prescribe it for   days  to be taken thrice a day 
We considered the amount of SSDs most commonly reported by pregnant women  weighing   kg  which was  –  g daily for   days 
The dose of the test item   mg kg  was calculated by using conversion factor of  Conversion factor is the ratio of the correction factors  estimated by dividing the average body weight in kgs of species by the body surface area in m  of the species  Km 
Human equivalent dose  HED in mg kg    Animal dose  mg kg  X correction factor  Km animal Km human 
Kms of every species are constant 
For humans it is    assuming average weight of adults to be   kg a surface area of   m  and for rats it is  Therefore  HED   mg  kg    animal dose X  
Or  animal dose         mg kg           mg kg Since pregnant women consume these orally  these were administered to rats by oral route The test items were coded as SSD   and SSD   and were provided to the experimental laboratory  Venus Medicine Research Center  Baddi  in powder form 
On the day of dosing  the doses were administered between  –  h  The test items were administered in fresh cow s milk at a final volume of   ml kg 
The doses were calculated on the basis of the latest body weight recorded for the study 
A stainless steel gavage cannula fitted to a calibrated syringe was used for dosing the animals For control animals  cow s milk was used as a vehicle while feeding The study was performed in two phases to evaluate the effect of SSD consumption duration during gestation period Adult  nulliparous female rats were mated with males of same species and strain in  
Each morning  dams were examined for the presence of a vaginal plug and vaginal smear was taken from each dam by using pipette smear technique 
The day of vaginal plug formation or sperms observed in vaginal smear  also known as successful mating  were considered as GD   Gestation day  
The mated females were housed individually in clear polycarbonate cages with stainless steel wire lids 
Mating process was carried out to result in   pregnant animals per group 
Successfully mated females were randomized into control and treatment groups 
All the rats were sacrificed on GD  
According to OECD guidelines  the test chemical should be administered daily from implantation to the day prior to scheduled caesarean section in order to assess toxicity 
Test chemicals were administered to pregnant animals and sacrificed as per the schedule  which was as close as possible to the normal day of delivery without risking loss of data resulting from early delivery i e GD  
The females were killed  before caesarean section  the uterine contents were examined  and the fetuses were evaluated for soft tissue and skeletal changes The pregnant rats were randomized to two intervention and one control groups 
SSD was given during pre implantation to implantation stage  GD  – 
Each group of rats was treated either with vehicle  G  VC  SSD   G    mg kg  or SSD   G    mg kg SSDs were given from GD  – 
Each group of rats was treated with either vehicle or SSD  or SSD 
Allocation of animals was randomized to the following groups  G   Control  VC  G   SSD    mg kg  G   SSD    mg kg  G   SSD    mg kg  G   SSD    mg kg  G SSD    mg kg  G   SSD    mg kg The following parameters were observed •Clinical Signs  Animals were observed once after successful mating or on GD  and after administration of the first dose 
Cage side observations for clinical signs of toxicity in the animals were recorded once daily until the day before necropsy •Body weight  Body weight of all experimental animals were recorded once before mating  initial body weight  and then after confirmation of mating 
Body weights were recorded on days               and on terminal day before sacrifice 
These recorded body weights were used for calculating the dose volume to be administered •Food consumption  Food consumption was evaluated once after successful mating or on day   of gestation  the day of vaginal plug formation or sperms observed in vaginal smear  and on days             and one day prior to sacrifice 
Calculated amount of feed were placed in the trough of each cage and the quantity of feed remaining after approximately   h were weighed and recorded •Morbidity Mortality  All the animals were observed twice daily  once in the morning between   and   h and once in the evening between   and   h  for incidence of morbidity and or mortality •Maternal examination related parameters  At the end of the observation period  all the dams were sequentially euthanized  by CO  asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation  and subjected to gross necropsy 
After termination  dams were examined macroscopically for any structural abnormalities or pathological changes 
Blinding was done while evaluation of the dams during caesarean section and subsequent foetal analyses to minimize bias 
Pregnancy rate was calculated as the proportion of mated pairs that had produced at least one pregnancy within a fixed period where pregnancy was determined by the earliest available evidence that fertilization has occurred 
Gestation index was calculated to indicate number of females with live born as a proportion of number of females with evidence of pregnancy •Examination of uterine contents  Immediately after termination  the uteri were removed and the pregnancy status of the animals ascertained 
Gravid uteri including the cervix were weighed  and number of corpora lutea were determined 
The uterine contents were examined for numbers of embryonic or foetal deaths and live foetuses 
The degree of resorption was described in order to estimate the relative time of death of the conceptus 
Any increase in the number of resorption and or implantation loss is an indicator of litter size for the individual dam •Examination of foetuses  The sex and weight of each foetus were determined 
Approximately one half of each litter were prepared and examined for skeletal alterations from selected dams 
The remainder were prepared and examined for soft tissue alterations  using accepted or appropriate serial sectioning methods or careful gross dissection techniques 
Each foetus was examined for external alterations 
Foetuses were examined for skeletal alterations  using Alizarin Red S staining method 
The fetuses for skeletal staining were kept in pre labelled plastic containers containing   ethanol before staining 
After skinning  we processed the foetus for staining by immersing in   alcian blue   GX for three days  then performed rehydration through a gradient series of ethanol   ethanol   –  h twice    ethanol   –  h  ethanol   –  h  distilled water until the samples sank to the bottom of a conical tube 
Samples were further treated with   KOH for  –  days or until it became clear and again treated with   alizarin red for next  –  days until bones became purple 
Samples were rinsed   times in   KOH  for  –  h at each time point 
Samples were further treated with a gradient series of glycerol  KOH    h   glycerol   h X  Visceral examination was done by micro dissection technique 
Fetuses were preserved in   formalin until they became fixed 
An illuminated magnifier was used for visceral examination 
We placed the foetus in a supine position on a paraffin wax block tray covered with paraffin wax  secured the fetal limbs by paper pins to the paraffin wax block  made a ventral midline incision from the umbilicus  cutting caudally to the genital tubercle and cranially to the diaphragm 
Once incision was completed  we located the ventral attachment of the diaphragm and lifted the liver carefully to examine the diaphragm for abnormal opening 
After observation  the diaphragm was clipped 
We gave a longitudinal cut to open the rib cage slightly lateral to and on the right of the sternebrae and then extended the cut anteriorly to neck region 
The rib cage was opened gently and secured to the paraffin block petridish tray with pins Foetuses were examined for soft tissue alterations  e g 
variations and malformations or anomalies  using Wilson s Technique 
The fetal viscera were examined sequentially  beginning with thoracic organs and moving caudally 
We performed hearts cuts after completion of other observations 
We examined the bilobed thymus for size  shape  coloration and presence of haemorrhages and then removed it for observation of trachea and esophagus 
We observed the lungs for size  color and number of lobes  observed the trachea  esophagus for normal alignment and presence of fistula  opened the pericardial sac and cut off pericardium to expose the heart for observation 
We checked the size  shape  color of the heart and normal development of major blood vessels 
After observation of thoracic viscera  we observed the abdominal viscera and liver for size  shape  color  texture  and number of lobes 
External anatomy of heart was examined by making two incisions using micro dissecting scissors We examined the stomach  spleen  pancreas  small and large intestines for size  position or any other developmental anomalies 
The intestines were moved aside after observation for seeing the underlying structures 
Ureters were checked for normal size and location and for continuity from the renal hilus to the urinary bladder 
One kidney was cut transversely and another was longitudinally to examine renal papilla and renal pelvis 
To confirm the sex of the foetus  the gonads were inspected carefully 
We examined the reproductive organs for size  shape and location GraphPad Prism® statistical software version   was used to analyze the data and all the results were represented as mean   S E M 
Intergroup variance for most of the parameters was calculated by one way analysis of variance  ANOVA  followed by Tukey s test 
A value of p     was regarded statistically significant 
Linear regression was performed to examine the weight change of dams during pregnancy for each group comparing with the control after adjusting for the litter size 
The malformations were analysed by performing Chi square test for trend for two groups  SSD  G  G  G  G  and SSD  G  G  G  G The ARRIVE guidelines were followed to report the findings 
In phase   pre natal study  all the dams dosed with SSD  and SSD  had normal food intake and weight gain 
The average gain in weight from GD  to GD   was       gms for controls while it was       gms in SSD   and       gms in SSD 
 Webtable  
No test item related mortality or clinical sign of toxicity was encountered during the study 
All dams in treatment groups and control group survived to scheduled terminal sacrifice 
They showed normal behaviour until euthanized 
There were no differences in mean maternal body weights  body weight gains  pregnancy rate  gestational index  pre and post implantation loss  and resorptions 
No significant differences were observed in foetal sex ratio  foetal body weights 
However  one dam from SSD  had all male foetuses 
No abnormality was detected in skeletal and visceral examination In phase   controls and SSD  and SSD  treated dams exhibited a comparable food intake  Table  
 
However  a dose response relationship was observed with reduced weight gain with higher doses of SSDs 
 Table  
 
Two dams  one in G   SSD    mg kg  and the other in G   SSD    mg kg  categories showed decreased or consistent body weight GD  onwards 
On an average  the weight on GD   was       gms in controls while it was       with SSD    mg kg  and       gms with SSD    mg kg 
The adjusted analysis indicated that except in G  there was a significant reduction in weight gain in all the intervention groups as compared to the control group after controlling for litter size  Table  
 During follow up  one dam from SSD    mg kg  and one from SSD    mg kg  showed haematuria during gestational day  – 
However  no another clinical sign of toxicity was encountered during the study 
All the dams in treatment and control groups showed normal behaviour and survived to scheduled terminal sacrifice 
In phase   pregnancy rate and gestational index were found to be   at all dose levels with SSD  whereas  in SSD  it decreased to   in G   SSD    mg kg  and G   SSD    mg kg  groups 
One dam from G   SSD    mg kg  and another one from G   SSD    mg kg  group showed mating confirmation during vaginal smear examination and showed positive sign in initial days of pregnancy but during necropsy on expected day of delivery  GD   no foetus was found 
Body weights of dams increased in the initial stages that became constant at a later period 
To reconfirm it  non gravid uterus was stained in salewski strain and presence of conceptus was found 
This indicated the possibility of miscarriage Increased pre and post implantation losses as well as resorptions and reduced live foetuses were observed with both SSD  and SSD 
No significant differences were observed in foetal sex ratio  but decreased foetal body weights were noted in both sexes 
On an average one early resorption in a group was a normal observation 
More than one late resorption was observed in all treatment groups while there was none in the control group 
Total count of live foetuses count was significantly reduced with SSD  and SSD  treatment in a dose dependent manner 
Total number of live foetuses were reduced up to   in SSD  at   mg kg treatment group and   in SSD  at   mg kg treatment group Both SSD  and SSD s at different dose levels showed decreased fetal weight in dose dependent manner  although the difference was not significant 
Skeletal and soft tissue alterations were observed in both treatment groups 
In general  the embryo–foetal examination showed abnormalities  which could have caused some functional damage to these foetuses if allowed to grow in the normal course 
In visceral examinations  slight dilation of the renal pelvis  reduced papilla size  urinary bladder hypertrophy was observed in few foetuses from both SSD  and SSD  treatment groups 
Few incidences of foetal soft tissue abnormalities encountered in this study were normal variants 
Skeletal examination showed variations in the ossification patterns like incomplete or poorly ossified skulls  ossification of sternebra  cleavage ossification of thoracic centrum  asymmetric thoracic centrum  and supernumerary rib in many foetuses in SSD  and SSD  groups  Table  
 
A trend was noted with increased incidence of certain malformations with increasing dosages of SSDs that was statistically significant for most malformations with SSD The results of this developmental toxicity study suggest that administration of SSDs to pregnant rats had significant impact on intrauterine foetal growth  early and late resorption as well as developmental anomalies 
These formulations have teratogenic potential but does not affect sex ratio IPs contain phytoestrogens like diadzein and genistein  In vitro rat whole embryo culture assay  WEC  studies of genistein in rats have indicated fetotoxic and teratogenic potential at concentration of ≥  μg mL  However  in vivo  an oral  gavage  embryonic and fetal development pilot study could not demonstrate any teratogenic effect in the same study 
These findings are different from our study probably because we used SSDs containing natural herbal and non herbal ingredients unlike those studies where synthetic genistein was used 
In both the studies  decreased body weight was observed indicating slight maternal toxicity 
Food consumption was unaffected in our study which is contrary to what was reported 
In another study  pregnant rats exposed to oral isoflavones  diadzein and genistein in varying combinations  showed alterations in the number of live foetuses  lysed foetuses  number of resorption sites  and implantation sites while no clinical signs suggestive of maternal toxicity  seizures  tremors and salivation  that was observed similar to our study 
Maternal mass gain was significantly reduced in rats treated with   mg kg of isoflavones  Ratio of females to males in the litter of different groups was similar akin to our finding  These observations clearly nullify the claim that consumption of SDDs could alter the sex of the growing foetus 
An analysis done by the same authors earlier revealed that SSDs contain testosterone and steroids 
 
  The prenatal testosterone in pregnancy is known to affect sexual development adversely      The principles of reproductive biology state that the genetic sex of an individual is determined at the time of conception and can never be altered under any circumstances 
However  phenotypic sex of the growing foetus is likely to be influenced by the hormonal milieu of in utero environment 
Our analysis was confined to phenotypic sex only and hence it is difficult to state if any differences existed with reference to genetic and phenotypic sex 
This requires further inquiry Evidence on the effects of SSDs on humans should best be obtained from human beings 
The findings of the current study corroborate well with the evidence generated from observational studies in human beings      Presence of skeletal and visceral malformations could explain why stillbirths are likely to be more in women who consume SSDs 
The dosing of the test drugs was intended not only to examine the period of organogenesis solely but to assess effects from preimplantation  through the entire period of gestation to the day before caesarean section 
The results were based on observations of more than   female animals with implantation sites at necropsy that added to its strength 
Unnecessary handling of pregnant animals as well as any stressors from outside was avoided 
At least three dose levels and a concurrent vehicle control were used with dams randomly allocated to different treatment groups that support the validity of the results 
However  absence of   rats per group does not support it to be a fully OECD compliant study 
We did follow the principles of Good Laboratory Practices  GLP  but due to constraints of resources the study could not be conducted as a GLP compliant study  though this is optimal for academic interests There is a lack of systematic approach to assess the safety and effectiveness of herbal preparations 
Ingredients for herbal medicines are often drawn from different sources and are used in combination  which may exhibit variability in terms of species  growing conditions  and biologically active constituents 
To isolate each active ingredient from each herb and then to establish its toxicity is time consuming  resource intensive and not practical 
Moreover  drug approval process does not accommodate undifferentiated mixtures  Though important  it surpasses the herb herb interaction and the potentiating effect of one compound over another 
Therefore  in our study  we administered the herbal mixture to assess the effects 
Real time evaluations have yielded important observations for several herbal drugs especially related to pregnancy 
For instance  Wang et al 
  used mice model to evaluate the adverse pregnancy outcomes after maternal exposure to the herbal medicines  particularly during early pregnancy  The major events included maternal and perinatal mortality 
Maternal weight gain  embryo growth and post natal weight gain were significantly decreased 
Moreover  foetal resorption and skeletal malformations were increased  signifying potential toxicity of Chinese herbal medicines 
This is comparable to our findings To conclude  the results of this developmental toxicity study suggest that administration of SSD  and SSD  to pregnant rats exerted significant impact on intrauterine foetal growth and development without any effect on sex ratio when administered during the period of organogenesis 
The prenatal exposure of SSD  and SSD  at dosage level of   mg kg day and   mg kg day during gestational days  –  to female rats had demonstrable effect on maternal or embryo foetal toxicity and teratogenicity SBN and AG conceptualized the study  AS and DD developed the study protocol and conducted the experiment  analysed the data and interpreted the findings

It is therefore natural to expect that the distribution of amino acids  across all protein sequences  would appear to be fixed  given no mutations over a specific period of time 
Of the   naturally occurring amino acids  each seems to appear randomly located at a particular position within the sequence of a protein 
However  when the sequences of a group of proteins are compared to one another  specific patterns begin to emerge 
These patterns are commonly referred to as motifs and frequently produce similar structural elements and in many cases  similar functions between the proteins that contain them 
In recent years  significant efforts have been made to reduce sequences into discrete motifs  so that each can be linked to some specific biological function based on particular rules      
Databases that consist of identifiable amino acid motifs  such as PROSITE  Pratt and EMOTIF  have been constructed to allow researchers an easy classification of unknown proteins into families based on their common motifs               
All of these methods share one property  they depend on specific alignment algorithms  such as the basic local alignment search tool  BLAST or PSI BLAST  to perform the sequence comparison between diverse families of proteins being analyzed      
These methods have already led to a number of key discoveries and offer the promise of determining biologically meaningful information about function from a protein s primary sequence It is generally accepted that a strong correlation exists between a protein s amino acid sequence and its resulting structure and function         
Techniques that can quickly determine significant similarities between protein sequences are valuable in predicting an unknown protein s function within the cell 
Here we describe a procedure that  by computing the frequency of key amino acid pairs  can quickly classify large groups of proteins into functional groups 
In order to uncover any relevant amino acid strings  we have utilized statistical methods applicable to datasets with large fluctuations in the search of human protein sequences within both the Swiss Prot and Complete Human Genebank databases The goal of this manuscript is to demonstrate how these two residue motifs can be used to develop rapid methods for searching protein or genomic databases in order to locate potentially interesting or aberrant protein sequences 
As an example  we describe the distribution of select amino acid pairs within the genome of the Coronavirus  Tor  which is responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome  SARS    
We have examined additional sets  but the limited format of this paper precludes a large presentation of potential applications The set of all   naturally occurring  amino acids are described by their standard single letter representations  and are taken as the complete set contained within all protein sequences as shown below Zq A R N D C Q E G H I L K M F P S T W Y V Residues that are arranged in a certain order can be referred to as vectors and are represented symbolically as b n b b bn bj Zq The coordinates of each vector represent the amino acid symbols contained within any given protein  where n is the total length of the vector 
The collection of all vectors b n  in the proteome can therefore be denoted simply by Zq n The underlying structure of a protein sequence  which is the order of the amino acids  has unique and identifiable characteristics 
As an analogy  in written English  the letter q is almost always followed by u 
Also  the frequency of the word  and  is much higher than that of the related three letter strings   nad   nda   dan  and  dna  which are simply permutations of the same set of individual letters to construct a word with a different meaning 
Utilizing similar characteristics  we can intuitively scan for unique sequence vectors contained within any given protein 
We expand on these characteristics  by utilizing the concepts of affinity and order stability in Section  Using the entire Swiss Prot database  release number   as the basis for our calculations  we have constructed a probability table for the occurrence of the   naturally occurring amino acids  see Table  
    
In addition to the Swiss Prot database  we have also included data from Complete Human Genebank  NCBI Build Number   March    as a source for all characterized and hypothetical human protein sequences We use the symbol Ω to denote the Swiss Prot database  and the letter M to denote the number of proteins in the database  
Hence we can state that Ω As s M  where As a a as Ns  is the sth protein  ai with i Zq is the ith amino acid in the sequence  and Ns is the length of the protein sequence As 
For any vector b n  if there is a sequence As in Ω such that b n  is a segment of As  then we can say b n  occurs in Ω 
We can then use NΩ b n  to denote the total number of outcomes that b n  has occurred in Ω  and let NΩ n  be the total number of all vectors occurring in Ω with length n  Therefore p b n NΩ b n NΩ n is the probability that the vector b n  occurs in Ω 
We then introduce k p q b n log p b n q b n where p b n  and q b n  are any two probability distributions on Zq n  and b n  belongs to Zq n 
The quantity k p q b n  in Eq 
  is defined for any two probability distributions p b n  and q b n  on Zq n  where the distribution q arises from independent letter  i e  amino acid  probabilities 
Then  k p q b n  can be viewed as a random variable about b n  and its probability distribution is defined as follows F p q x PI k p q b n ⩽x b n k p q b n ⩽xp b n The expectation value μ p q  and variance σ p q  of p b n  are expressed mathematically as μ p q b n Zq n p b n k p q b n 
 σ p q b n Zq n p b n k p q b n μ p q  Hence we see that μ p q  is simply the Kullback–Leibler entropy   
As a consequence  μ p q  is always non negative and μ p q  if and only if p b n q b n 
As a result  the amino acid sequence of b n  can be represented by k p q b n In Eq 
  the probability distributions p  q in the k p q b n  have several possible values 
For example  if we let p be the probability of b n  and only change the value of q in k p q b n  we obtain the following expression q b n j np bj p b p b p bn Based on Eqs 
  and   the value of k p q b n  gives us the affinity for all amino acids within vector b n 
Here two situations are identified as especially interesting i When k p q b n  implies that among the amino acids in vector b n  there is an increased affinity 
That is  the vector b n  occurs more frequently than expected 
 ii When k p q b n  implies that among the amino acids in vector b n  there is a decreased affinity 
That is  the vector b n  occurs less frequently than expected In a similar approach to the condition described above  we may choose q b n p πn b n  where πn b n  is a permutation of b n  and πn denotes a permutation transform 
In this case  the order sensitivity of b n  can also be reflected by the value of k p q b n  and produces the following outcomes i when k p q b n  implies that b n  occurs much more often than πn b n ii when k p q b n  implies that πn b n  occurs much more often than b n In addition to the concepts of affinity and order sensitivity  we can also design other analysis techniques by choosing alternate representations of q b n 
Quantifying the terms k p q b n  we can represent vector frequency numerically 
In cases where k p q b n μ p q ⩾ σ p q  the corresponding vector b n  is called  positive  while in those cases where the opposite takes place  k p q b n μ p q ⩽ σ p q  the vector b n  is called  negative 
By judiciously choosing a   equal to   we obtained   two residue  positive pairs  and   two residue negative pairs  see Table  
  out of a total of   possibilities of amino acid pairs Using any one of the positive motifs from Table   we can develop a test method to detect changes in their distribution through any protein database 
If b b b  is  positive  then p b b μ σp b p b  where p ⋅  is the probability of the amino acids or vectors ⋅ in the database 
Since NΩ μ M Nμ p bj NΩ bj μ MNμ we have NΩ b μ M Nμ μ MNμ μ σp b NΩ b or NΩ b μ M Nμ μ MNμ μ σp b NΩ b and since μ M Nμ is very close to μ MNμfor Swiss Prot database we have NΩ b μ σp b NΩ b and NΩ b μ σp b NΩ b As a consequence of Eq 
  the detection of a deleterious mutation based on the increased appearance of an arbitrary string of these residues becomes possible 
For example  according to Table   CC is an attractive motif with   then NΩ CC μ σp C μ M Nμ μ MNμNΩ C ≈ μ σp C NΩ C Let Ns CC  and Ns C  be the number of CC and the number of C in the sth protein 
Then we have NΩ CC NΩ C  because μ σ  and p C  since NΩ CC s MNs CC NΩ C s MNs C Based upon the result that the CC pair represents a rare event  proteins satisfying Ns CC Ns C  as defined in Eq 
  suddenly become interesting 
We can therefore consider the number Ns CC  as an index to develop detection methods to test for the presence of a CC containing protein within a database 
Using this same reasoning  one can also use any other one of the remaining motifs in Table   to develop detection methods for additional proteins In an identical fashion to the previous example using the positive two residue motifs in Table   we can also use any of the  negative  two residue motifs to develop search methods 
For example  the CM pair is a  negative  two residue  word  with  
That is  p CM μ σp C p M 
Using identical arguments to those described in Section   we obtain NΩ CM NΩ M  and NΩ CM NΩ C 
Since both Ns M  and Ns C  are small numbers for fixed proteins  the overall number of CM pairs in most proteins should be close to zero 
Therefore  we can also use any of the remaining seven  negative  motifs in Table   to develop additional detection methods In contrast to the CC motif  the total number of proteins in the Swiss Prot database having more than one CM pair is quite small 
For example  among the   proteins contained within this database  the number of proteins such that Ns CM ⩾  is   and the number of proteins satisfying the condition Ns CM ⩾  is only  
For human proteins in Swiss Prot  the total number of proteins containing CM pairs is   and there are only   proteins that satisfy Ns CM ⩾   Table  
However  we would expect to find about   proteins having CM pairs in the Swiss Prot database  based upon the amino acid frequencies given in Table   which is greater than the number observed Cysteine rich proteins and the presence of CC pairs in proteins are both concepts that have been studied previously      
If we combine these two concepts and describe them in mathematical terms  we observe that the rates q Ns C Ns and q Ns CC Ns C  describe these two conditions  where Ns  Ns C  and Ns CC  are the numbers of all amino acids  cysteine  and CC  respectively 
We can then derive proteinsNs C Ns p C σ Ns CC Ns C p ξτ C ξτ C σ where σ  and σ  are the standard deviations about Ns C Nss Mand Ns CC Ns C s M respectively We have found the following computational results based on Swiss Prot database σ ≈ σ ≈ andp ξτ C ξτ C ⩾ p C For   we have a much simpler method to determine that a protein sequence is both C  and CC rich if proteinsNs C Ns ∩proteinsNs CC Ns C So  a much simpler method to test whether a protein is a both C  and CC rich for   isNumber of CC  Number of C Number of C  Length of protein Using this principle  we found a total of eight proteins that are both C  and CC rich within the Swiss Prot database For   there is an easier method to determine whether a protein sequence is both C  and CC rich if proteinsNs C Ns ∩proteinsNs CC Ns C So  a much simpler method to test whether a protein is both C  and CC rich for   is based on the inequalitiesNumber of CC  Number of C Number of C  Length of protein Using this principle  we can get a total of   proteins that are both C  and CC rich within the entire Swiss Prot database For   there is also an easier method to determine if a protein sequence is both C  and CC rich sequence when proteinsNs C Ns ∩proteinsNs CC Ns C So  a much simpler method to test whether a protein is both C  and CC rich for   is based on the inequalitiesNumber of CC  Number of C Number of C Length of protein Using this principle  we have identified a total of   proteins that are both C  and CC rich within the Swiss Prot database 
From these results  it becomes clear that there are many C rich proteins and many CC rich proteins that are not mutually inclusive 
The sets of both C  and CC rich proteins are only subsets of the set containing all C rich proteins or that containing all CC rich proteins Because the Swiss Prot database is somewhat biased to those proteins that are of interest to researchers  we have decided to examine a database that was  in essence  complete 
For this  we chose the human subset sequences contained within the Complete Human Genebank database 
This was the most complete and readily available source of human genetic sequences and should therefore provide us with an accurate representation of both CC and CM pair distributions 
We observed that the total number of CC pairs within the human subset of sequences contained in Genebank  a total of   proteins  was  
These pairs were contained within a total of   proteins  Table   a number that is substantially larger than the   we obtained from Swiss Prot data  Table  
Since the total number of amino acids in The Complete Human Genebank is   we can easily get the expected number of CC in Complete Human Genebank is   which is much less than this actual value  
The same also holds true for the CM pair  where we would expect to see   CM pairs  but actually observe    Table  
 
This result is surprising but true and shows that there are fundamental difference between the Human and other species in terms of the frequency of CC and CM pairs To create a single CM pair  it is obvious that one needs only a single C  If a protein sequence also contains a CC pair  the total number of cysteines available to create a CM pair has been reduced by a factor of  
Using the cutoff value of four CC pairs as statistically significant  we determined the probability of finding a CM pair within proteins that already contained a CC pair  Table  
Even though both CC and CM can occur in the same protein  the total number of proteins in Genebank that contain both CC and CM pairs is   and these pairs almost always occur at different locations in the sequence 
However  in some rare cases the second C within the CC pair is shared with the first C within the CM pair  giving us a new triplet CCM If we filter the set of proteins described above for redundant entries  we obtain a set of   unique proteins that contain the CCM triplet in the human proteome 
Using the probability distributions obtained from Swiss Prot  we obtained the probability of CCM as  
Since the total of all protein lengths in the Swiss Prot database is   there should be a total of   CCM triplets 
This value is almost identical to the predicted number of CCM of  
This result suggests that the CCM triplet at least in Swiss Prot occurs randomly 
However  we can also analyze the CCM probability using a different approach  putting q CCM p CC p M  into Eq 
 
If CCM occurs randomly  then we have p CCM p C p C p M  and since p CC μ σp C p C  we will get k p q CCM log p CCM q CCM log p C p CC ⩽ μ σ Based on Eq 
  it is clear that the presence of a CC pair strongly excludes M  Therefore  the probability of the CCM triplet should occur less frequently than that of CC or M individually We have obtained the following statistical results with regard to the total number of CC and CM pairs contained in the Swiss Prot database i The total number of these proteins satisfying Ns CC ⩾  is   and   of these are found in humans 
 ii The total number of human proteins in Ω that satisfy Ns CC ⩾  is  
 iii The total number of the proteins in Ω that satisfy Ns CM ⩾  is     of these are found in humans 
 iv The total number of human proteins in Ω that satisfy Ns CM ⩾  is only  
The genome of the SARS associated Coronavirus contains a total of   open reading frames  which code for six characterized and five uncharacterized proteins   
After examining the complete proteome the SARS associated Coronavirus we observed a statistically significant increase in the occurrence of the CC and CM pairs in the SARS associated Coronavirus  genome Of the   putative proteins  four contain either CC or CM pairs 
Two large poly proteins  GI  and GI  contain   CC and   CM pairs  as well as   CC and   CM pairs  respectively 
The putative spike glycoprotein  GI    contains   CC and   CM  while the small envelope protein  GI    contains only   CC pair 
The remaining   proteins  of which two have been identified as a nucleocapsid and matrix protein  contain no CC or CM pairs 
When compared to the occurrence of CC and CM pairs within all human proteins found in the Swiss Prot database  it becomes clear that there is an increased occurrence of these pairs within the SARS associated Coronavirus proteome It is clear that the frequency of CC and CM pairs is significantly higher in the SARS genome than it is in the human genome 
It is our hope that these unique two residue motifs could be used as a means of identifying a virus such as SARS 
While currently impossible to determine  one can see a possible clinical use for determining the frequency of CC or CM pairs in an individual 
If a person has been infected by SARS  we would expect the numbers of CC and CM pairs to be much higher than in a healthy individual 
If we were then able to develop a clinically feasible technique that could identify the CC or CM pair content in total cellular protein  without damaging the cell  it could be possible to implement a detection method simply by counting the numbers of CC or CM pairs in all proteins examined 
If the presence of increased CC or CM pairs was indicative of infection by SARS we could develop new drugs to inhibit the translation of proteins that contain these pairs within infected cells 
As a very specific example  this could be accomplished through the use of specific tRNA mimics that could block translating ribosome when these pairs appear at the P and A site simultaneously      
While tRNA mimics could normally be seen as non specific protein synthesis inhibitors  the lower frequency of the CC or CM motifs in host proteins as compared to the relatively high occurrence in viral protein provide a starting point for the analysis of treatments using methods such as these In this paper we have performed a detailed search of the Swiss Prot and Complete Human Genebank database in relation to the frequencies of each of the   natural amino acids and motifs made up of two residues 
This has provided us with a new insight into the distribution of proteins within these databases and the information that may be contained within a protein s primary amino acid sequence 
Our focus in this quest has been to examine specific pairs or triplets of residues and use probability theory to assess whether or not particular strings of residues occur more frequently than their probability would indicate 
By analyzing affinity and anti affinity  we developed a procedure to search out all two  and three residue clusters within these databases 
Through this technique  we can rapidly classify large groups of proteins into families based on the occurrence of these motifs 
Combining this concept with a specific knowledge of protein function  we propose novel ideas aimed at developing fast detection methods for specific diseases based on the unusually high occurrence of some of these motifs when compared with the expected probabilities 
A timely example of the application of this method is given  namely the analysis of the SARS virus 
This method will hopefully lead to the discovery of new diagnostic techniques and possible treatment of diseases  by recognizing the location of target domains in the expressed sequence Cell type specific expression of the putative SARS CoV  receptor ACE  in human heartsThe coronavirus disease    COVID  caused by SARS CoV  infections imposes a major threat for the world s healthcare systems and is leading to thousands of deaths 
Angiotensin converting enzyme    ACE  has been identified as a potential receptor for SARS coronavirus  and is also considered the main receptor for SARS CoV  SARS CoV  binds to ACE  via its glycosylated outer membrane spike proteins 
ACE  is highly expressed in the lung and heart  and is known for its vital role in the cardiovascular system –  Although SARS CoV  mainly invades alveolar epithelial cells  it can also cause myocardial injury  as assessed by increased troponin T and NT proBNP levels accompanying increased cardiovascular symptoms in COVID infected patients  It is unclear whether elevated biomarkers of cardiac injury  or long term effects on the cardiovascular system  are directly caused by viral infection of cardiac tissue or are secondary to hypoxia and systemic inflammation 
However  patients with underlying cardiovascular disease represent a significant proportion of the patients who may suffer from a severe course after COVID  infection  This situation may be aggravated by findings showing that ACE inhibitors  which are often used to treat cardiovascular diseases  augment the expression of the SARS CoV  receptor ACE  in lung cells  This is probably mediated by an effect on angiotensin II  which is known to reduce ACE  expression  Thus  ACE inhibition decreases angiotensin II  leading to an indirect up regulation of ACE  The effect of angiotensin II receptor blockers  ARBs  which primarily target the angiotensin receptor   is unclear 
One may speculate that ARBs indirectly reduce ACE  levels by augmenting free angiotensin II levels  which in turn is expected to down regulate ACE  via activating the angiotensin receptor  
However  the effect of the two different treatments on the expression of ACE  in the heart requires further investigation Therefore  we used single nuclei RNA sequencing to determine the expression of ACE and ACE  in the different cell types of the human heart 
Gene expression signatures were detected in cardiac tissues of five patients with aortic stenosis  AS  and two patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction  HFrEF   Figure  A  and compared with with samples of one healthy donor heart  age    years  male  that was not used for transplantation 
After single nuclei RNA sequencing  data were pooled  and unsupervised clustering was performed with a total of     nuclei 
We found   distinct clusters 
Using cell type specific gene markers  major cell types were annotated  including cardiomyocytes  six clusters  fibroblasts  one cluster  endothelial cells  three clusters  leucocytes  two clusters  pericytes  one cluster  and smooth muscle cells  one cluster   Figure  B–D 
ACE  was expressed in cardiomyocytes  Cluster   and   and mural cells  particularly pericytes  Cluster   and was detected at a lower expression level in fibroblasts  endothelial cell  and leucocytes  Figure  D 
Comparison of ACE  in a pooled analysis of nuclei of the different groups showed that ACE  was significantly elevated in cardiomyocytes of patients with heart disease compared with healthy controls  Figure  E 
ACE  was also slightly  but not significantly  increased in endothelial cells  and the expression was lower in fibroblasts of patients with heart disease compared with healthy controls  Figure  E 
Immunostaining confirmed an increased expression of ACE  in cardiomyocytes of patients with aortic stenosis  Figure  F 
In addition  ACE was augmented in cardiomyocytes of patients with AS and HFrEF  Figure  G 
Interestingly  cardiomyocytes of patients who were treated with ACE inhibitors showed a significantly higher ACE  expression compared with ARB treated patients  Figure  H 
Moreover  patients treated with ACE inhibitors had an imbalance of ACE to ACE  expression  with a more than four fold higher ACE ACE  ratio compared with healthy control cells  Figure  I In conclusion  these data provide novel insights into the cell type specific expression and regulation of ACE  in the heart 
Patients with varying heart disease aetiology show augmented expression of ACE  levels particularly in cardiomyocytes 
Treatment with ACE inhibitors tends to be associated with increased ACE  mRNA and unfavourable ACE ACE  ratios  which are believed to be a driver of cardiovascular pathologies  This study is limited by its small sample size and therefore is only hypothesis generating 
However  these novel data suggest that it will be important to monitor SARS CoV infected patients for cardiovascular complications and assess the impact of ARB ACE inhibitor therapy 
Conflict of interest  none declared Recombination Every Day  Abundant Recombination in a Virus during a Single Multi Cellular Host InfectionAs increasing numbers of full length viral sequences become available  recombinant or mosaic viruses are being recognized more frequently   
Recombination events have been demonstrated to be associated with viruses expanding their host range   or increasing their virulence    thus accompanying  or perhaps even being at the origin of  major changes during virus adaptation 
It remains unclear  however  whether recombination events represent a highly frequent and significant phenomenon in the everyday life of these viruses Viruses can exchange genetic material when at least two different viral genomes co infect the same host cell 
Progeny can then become hybrid through different mechanisms  such as reassortment of segments when the parental genomes are fragmented    intra molecular recombination when polymerases switch templates  in RNA viruses     or homologous or non homologous recombination  in both RNA and DNA viruses 
Quantification of viral recombination in multi cellular organisms has been attempted under two distinct experimental approaches  in vitro  in cell cultures     and in vivo  in live hosts    
The in vitro approach  which has so far been applied only to animal viruses  allows the establishment of the  intrinsic  recombination rate in experimentally co infected cells in cell cultures   
However  it does not necessarily reflect the situation in entire  living hosts  where the frequency of co infected cells is poorly known and depends on many factors such as the size of the pathogen population  the relative frequency and distribution of the different variants  and host defense mechanisms preventing secondary infection of cells 
The in vivo experimental approach is closer to biological conditions and may thus be more informative of what actually happens in  the real world However  as discussed below  numerous experimental constraints have so far precluded an actual quantification of the baseline rate of recombination 
First  many experimental designs have used extreme positive selection  where only recombinant genomes were viable  e g    
Other studies did not use complementation techniques but detected recombinants by PCR within infected hosts or tissues    which provides information on their presence but not on their frequency in the viral population 
So far  no quantitative PCR or other quantitative method has been applied to evaluate the number of recombinants appearing in an experimentally infected live host 
Finally  recent methods based on sequence analysis inferred the population recombination rate  rather than the individual recombination rate   
While results from these methods certainly take in vivo recombination into account  there are other caveats  isolates have often been collected in different hosts sometimes in different geographical regions and sometimes the selective neutrality of sequence variation on which these estimates are based is not clearly established 
Estimates from such studies by essence address the estimation of the recombination rate at a different evolutionary scale Taken together  the currently available information indicates that no viral recombination rate has ever been estimated directly at time and space scales corresponding to a single multi cellular host infection  although this level is most significant for the biology and evolution of viruses 
This study intends to fill this gap by evaluating the recombination frequency of the cauliflower mosaic virus  CaMV  during a single passage in one of its host plants  the turnip Brassica rapa CaMV is a pararetrovirus  which is a major grouping containing hepadnaviruses  e g  hepatitis B virus  badnaviruses  e g  banana streak virus  and caulimoviruses  e g  CaMV 
Pararetroviruses are characterized by a non segmented double stranded DNA genome 
After entering the host cell nucleus  the viral DNA accumulates as a minichromosome   whose transcription is ensured by the host RNA polymerase II   
The CaMV genome consists in approximately   bp and encodes six viral gene products that have been detected in planta  Figure     
Viral proteins P  to P  are expressed from two major transcripts  namely a  S RNA  encoding P  and a  S RNA corresponding to the entire genome and serving as mRNA for proteins P –P    
Using the pre genomic  S RNA as a matrix  the protein P   product of gene V  reverse transcribes the genome into genomic DNA that is concomitantly encapsidated   The detection of CaMV recombinants in turnip hosts has been reported numerous times 
Some studies have demonstrated the appearance of infectious recombinant viral genomes after inoculation  i  of a host plant with two infectious or non infectious parental clones   or  ii  of a transgenic plant containing one CaMV transgene with a CaMV genome missing the corresponding genomic region   
While the former revealed inter genomic viral recombination  the latter demonstrated that CaMV can also recombine with transgenes within the host s genome 
Another study based on phylogenetic analyses of various CaMV strains has clearly suggested different origins for different genomic regions and  hence  multiple recombination events during the evolution of this virus   
Indirect experimental evidence has indicated that  in some cases  CaMV recombination could occur within the host nucleus  between different viral minichromosomes  presumably through the action of the DNA repair cellular machinery   
Nevertheless  the mechanism of  template switching  during reverse transcription  predominant in all retroviruses  most certainly also applies to pararetroviruses 
For this reason  and on the basis of numerous experimental data  CaMV is generally believed to recombine mostly in the cytoplasm of the host cell  by  legal  template switching between two pre genomic RNA molecules    or  illegal  template switching between the  S and the  S RNA   
Under this hypothesis  recombination in CaMV could therefore be considered as operating on a linear template during reverse transcription  with the  ′ and  ′ extremities later ligated to circularize the genomic DNA  position   in Figure  
The above cited studies clearly demonstrate that CaMV is able to recombine 
However  since these studies are based on complementation techniques  non quantitative detection  or phylogenetically based inferences of recombination  they do not inform us on whether recombination is an exceptional event or an  everyday  process shaping the genetic composition of CaMV populations In the present work  we aimed at answering this question 
To this end  we have constructed a CaMV genome with four genetic markers  demonstrated to be neutral in competition experiments 
By co inoculating host plants with equal amounts of wild type and marker containing CaMV particles  we have generated mixed populations in which impressive proportions of recombinants distributed in several different classes corresponding to exchange of different genomic regions have been detected and quantified 
Altogether  the recombinant genomes averaged over   of the population 
Further analysis of these data  assuming a number of viral replications during the infection period ranging from five to   indicates that the per nucleotide per replication cycle recombination rate of CaMV is of the same order of magnitude  i e  on the order of a few   across the entire genome 
We thereby provide the first quantification  to our knowledge  of the recombination rate in a virus population during a single passage in a single host From Figure   and supposing that all marker containing genomic regions can recombine  we could predict the detection and quantification of seven classes of recombinant genotypes   bcd a  a cd b  ab d c  abc d   cd ab  a d bc  and a c b d 
Indeed  all classes were detected  and their frequencies in the ten CaMV populations analyzed are summarized in Table  Altogether  the proportion of recombinant genomes found in the mixed viral populations was astonishingly high and very similar in the ten co infected plants analyzed  Table   last column  ranging between    plant   to    plants     and   with a mean frequency   standard error  of      
This result indicates that recombination events are very frequent during the invasion of the host plant by CaMV and represents  to our knowledge  the first direct quantification of viral recombination during the infection of a live multi cellular host The inferred per generation recombination and interference rates  assuming that CaMV undergoes ten replication cycles during the   d between infection and sampling  are given for each of the ten plants in Table  
Recombination rates between adjacent markers are large  on the order of   to  
Taking the distance in nucleotides between markers into account yields an average recombination rate per nucleotide and generation on the order of      
Interestingly  this recombination rate does not vary throughout the genome  Kruskal–Wallis test  p    To relax the assumption of the number of replications during the   d  we calculated the recombination parameters assuming five or   generations 
The effect of the number of generations on the estimates is linear  doubling the number of generations results in a halving of the recombination rate  detailed results not shown 
For example  the average recombination rates r
  r
  and r
  assuming   generations were equal to     and   respectively  compare with values in Table   yielding per nucleotide per generation recombination rates of             and      Inspection of Table   also shows that first order interference coefficients were in general negative  indicating that a crossing over in one genomic segment increases the probability that a crossing over will occur in another genomic segment  while the second order coefficient parameter had an average value close to zero with a large variance 
The mechanism leading to these results will be discussed in the following section One major breakthrough in the work presented here lies in the space and time scales at which the experiments were performed 
Indeed  the processes occurring within the course of a single infection of one multi cellular host are of obvious biological relevance for any disease 
Previous studies on viral recombination suffered from major drawbacks in this respect  basing their conclusions on experiments relying on complementation among non infectious viruses or between viruses with undetermined relative fitness  on phylogenetically based analyses  or on experiments in cell cultures 
For reasons detailed in the Introduction  the first two methods either do not provide information on the frequency of recombination  but only its occurrence  or address the question at a different temporal  and often spatial  scale 
Results from cell cultures  on the other hand  impose cell co infection by different viral variants  potentially overestimating the frequency of recombination events 
Our study circumvents these limitations by analyzing viral genotypes sampled from infected plants after the course of a single infection  and therefore the invasion and co infection of cells in various organs and tissues is very close to natural More than half of the genomes       see Table   present in a CaMV population after a single passage in its host plant were identified as recombinants  and these data allowed us to infer a per nucleotide per generation recombination rate on the order of       to      
The time length of one generation  i e  the time required for a given genome to go from one replication to the next  is totally unknown in plant viruses 
The only experimental data available on CaMV are based on the kinetics of gene expression in infected protoplasts  where the capsid protein is produced between   and   h   
The reverse transcription and the encapsidation of genomic DNA being two coupled phenomena    we judged it reasonable to assume a generation time of   d and  thus  an average of ten generations during our experiments 
In case this estimate is mistaken  we have verified a linear relationship between r and the number of generations  thereby allowing an immediate adjustment of r if the CaMV generation time is more precisely established 
At this point  we must consider that all cloned genomes may not have been through all the successive replication events potentially allowed by the timing of our experiments 
It was previously shown that about   of CaMV mature virus particles accumulate in compact inclusion bodies    where they may be sequestered for a long time  as such inclusions are very frequent in all infected cells  including those in leaves that have been invaded by the virus population for several weeks 
The viral population may thus present an age structure that could bias the estimation of the recombination rate 
In order to minimize this bias  the clones we analyzed were collected in one young newly formed leaf  where the chances of finding genomes from  unsequestered lines  were assumed to be higher 
In any case  our data analysis is conservative  since this age structure can only lead to an underestimation of the recombination rate Our results show that interferences between pairs of loci are negative  a recombination event between two loci apparently increases the probability of recombination between another pair of loci 
We believe that the most parsimonious explanation of these negative interferences is based on the way the infection builds up within plant hosts 
Indeed  one can divide infected host cells into those infected by a single virus genotype and those infected by more than one viral genotype 
In the former  analogous to clonal propagation  recombination is undetectable 
In the latter  recombination is not only detectable but  as our results indicate  very frequent 
Samples consisting of viruses resulting from a mixture of these two types of host cell infections will thus contain viruses with no recombination and viruses with several recombination events  thus yielding an impression of negative interference 
These conceptual arguments are supported by mathematical models 
It is indeed easy to show  detailed results not shown  that if a proportion F of the population reproduces clonally  analogous to single infections  while the remaining reproduces panmictically  negative interferences could be inferred even if they do not exist 
For example  assuming a three locus model with real recombination rates r
  and r
  and interference i
  the  apparent  recombination and interference parameters  would be r
        F r  r
        F r
  and i
     F   i
    F 
Interestingly  this example also shows that our estimates of the recombination rate are conservative  that a fraction F of host cells are singly infected while others are multiply infected leads to an underestimation of the recombination rate As judged by r
  r
  and r
  calculated between markers a–b  b–c  and c–d  respectively  we found evidence for recombination through the entire CaMV genome 
The values for r
 
r
  and r
  are remarkably similar  hence the recombination sites seem to be evenly distributed along the genome 
We considered the template switching model as the major way recombinants are created in CaMV 
As already mentioned in the Introduction  hot spots of template switching have been predicted at the position of the  ′ extremities of the  S and  S RNAs   
If other recombination mechanisms  such as that associated with second strand DNA synthesis or with the host cell DNA repair machinery  act significantly  hot spots would be expected at the positions of the sequence interruption     and     
Due to the design of our experiment and the position of the four markers  we have no information on putative hot spots at positions corresponding to the  ′ end of the  S RNA and to    at nucleotide position  
Nevertheless  the putative hot spots at the  ′ end of the  S RNA and at   and    nucleotide positions   and   respectively  fall between marker pairs c–d  b–c  and a–b  respectively 
Our results indicate that either these hot spots are quantitatively equivalent though predicted by different recombination mechanisms or  more likely  that they simply do not exist 
Whatever the explanation  what we observe is that the CaMV can exchange any portion of its genome  and thus any gene thereof  with an astonishingly high frequency during the course of a single host infection To our knowledge  the viral recombination rate has never previously been quantified experimentally for a plant virus   
In contrast  retroviruses and particularly HIV  have been extensively investigated in that sense 
As we have already discussed for these latter cases  the quantification of the intrinsic recombination rate was carried out in artificially co infected cell cultures 
The estimated intrinsic per nucleotide per generation recombination rate in HIV  is on the order of      less than one order of magnitude higher than our estimation for CaMV 
Because for various reasons detailed above we probably underestimate the within host CaMV recombination rate  we believe that the intrinsic recombination rate in CaMV is higher and perhaps on the order of that of HIV Other pararetroviruses such as plant badnaviruses or vertebrate hepadnaviruses have a similar cycle within their host cells  including steps of nuclear minichromosome  genomic size RNA synthesis  and reverse transcription and encapsidation 
Nevertheless  vertebrate hepadnaviruses  e g  hepatitis B virus  infect hosts that are very different from plants in their biology and physiology  and this could lead to a totally different frequency of cell co infection during the development of the virus populations 
Thus  even though our results can be informative for other pararetroviruses because of the viruses  shared biological characteristics  they should not be extrapolated to vertebrate pararetroviruses without caution We used the plasmid pCa  which is the complete genome of the CaMV isolate Cabb S  cloned into the pBR  plasmid at the unique SalI restriction site   
To analyze recombination in different regions of the genome  we introduced four genetic markers  a  b  c  and d  at the positions       and   respectively  thus approximately at four cardinal points of the CaMV circular double stranded DNA of   bp  Figure  
All markers  each corresponding to a single nucleotide change  were introduced by PCR directed mutagenesis in pCa  and resulted in the duplication of previously unique restriction sites BsiWI  PstI  MluI  and SacI in a plasmid designated pMark S  Because  in this study  we targeted the possible exchange of genes between viral genomes  all markers a  b  c  and d were introduced within coding regions corresponding to open reading frames I  IV  V  and VI  respectively 
Another important concern was to quantify recombination in the absence of selection  i e  to create neutral markers 
Consequently all markers consist of synonymous mutations  see below To generate the parental virus particles  plasmids pCa  and pMark S were mechanically inoculated into individual plants as previously described   
All plants were turnips  B  rapa cv   Just Right  grown under glasshouse conditions at   °C with a    light dark  photoperiod 
Thirty days post inoculation  all symptomatic leaves were harvested and viral particles were purified as described earlier   The resulting preparations of parental viruses  designated Cabb S and Mark S  were quantified by spectrometry using the formula described by Hull et al 
  
We fixed the initial frequency of markers to a value of   and a solution containing   mg ml of virus particles of both Cabb S and Mark S at a   ratio was prepared 
Plantlets were co infected by mechanical inoculation of two to three leaves with   μl of this virus solution  using abrasive Celite AFA  Fluka  Ronkonkoma  New York  United States 
The mixed CaMV population was allowed to grow during   d of systemic infection We designed an experimental protocol for quantifying marker frequency within a mixed Cabb S Mark S virus population after a single passage in a host plant 
Twenty four individual plants  inoculated as above with equal amounts of Cabb S and Mark S  were harvested   d post inoculation  when symptoms were fully developed 
The viral DNA was purified from   mg of young newly formed infected leaves according to the protocol described previously   
After the precipitation step of this protocol  the viral DNA was resuspended and further purified with the Wizard DNA clean up kit  Promega  Fitchburg  Wisconsin  United States  in TE  X   mM Tris HCl and   mM EDTA  pH   
Aliquots of viral DNA preparations were digested by restriction enzymes corresponding either to marker a  b  c  or d and submitted to a   agarose gel electrophoresis  colored by ethydium bromide and exposed to UV 
Each individual restriction enzyme cut once in Cabb S DNA and twice in Mark S  thus generating DNA fragments of different sizes attributable to one or the other in the mixed population of CaMV genomes 
After scanning the agarose gels  we estimated the relative frequency of the two genotypes in each viral DNA preparation and at each marker position  by densitometry using the NIH   Image program 
The statistical analyses of the frequency of the four markers are described below To identify and quantify the recombinants within the CaMV mixed populations  aliquots from ten of the   viral DNA preparations described above were digested by the restriction enzyme SalI  and directly cloned into pUC  at the corresponding site 
In each of the ten viral populations analyzed    full genome length clones were digested separately by BsiWI  PstI  MluI  and SacI  to test for the presence of marker a  b  c  and d  respectively 
In this experiment  with the marker representing an additional restriction site  we could easily distinguish between the Cabb S and the Mark S genotype at all four marker positions  upon agarose gel   electrophoresis of the digested clones 
Clones with none or all four markers were parental genotypes  whereas clones harboring     or   markers were clearly recombinants 
Due to the very high number of recombinants detected  markers eventually appearing or disappearing due to spontaneous mutations were neglected Here we present the different methods we used to quantify recombination in the CaMV genome 
Because all these methods assume that the different markers are neutral  we first discuss assumption We used two datasets to test the neutrality of markers  both resulting from plants co infected with a   ratio of Mark S and Cabb S 
The first consisted of viral DNA densitometry data derived from   plants  described above  where for each plant we have an estimate of the frequency of each marker in the genome population 
The second consisted of the restriction of   individual full genome length viral clones obtained from one co infected plant  described above  yielding an estimate of the frequency of each marker  and this was repeated on ten different plants 
The frequencies of the different markers were       and   for markers a  b  c  and d in the first dataset and       and   in the second dataset 
We tested whether these frequencies were significantly different from the expected value under neutrality    using either t tests  for datasets where normality could not be rejected  seven out of eight cases  or Wilcoxon signed rank non parametric tests otherwise  marker c in the first dataset 
In all cases p values were larger than  There are several cautionary remarks regarding these analyses 
First  in all cases we found an excess of markers 
Unfortunately  the two datasets cannot be regarded as independent because  even though the methods through which the frequency estimates were obtained were different  the plants used in the second dataset were a subset of the plants of the first 
We thus have only four independent estimates in each case  and there is minimal power to detect significant deviations from neutrality with such a small sample size 
It should be noted at this stage that deviations from the expected value could also be caused either by slight deviations from the   ratio in the infecting mixed solution  or by deviations from that ratio in the frequency of the viral particles that actually get into the plants 
Second  because of the relatively small sample sizes and low statistical power  the tests presented above could have detected only large deviations The results clearly show  however  precisely that the markers do not have large effects  if any  and that therefore recombination estimates would be affected only very slightly by any hypothetical selective effects of the markers 
Because of this  along with the fact that the introduced markers provoke silent substitutions in the CaMV genome  we assumed that markers were effectively neutral in the rest of the analysis The dataset used to estimate the recombination frequency consisted of the   full genome length viral clones   from each of ten co infected plants  individually genotyped for each of the four markers 
As discussed in detail in the Results  recombination was very frequent and concerned all four markers 
Indeed  approximately half of the genotyped clones exhibited a recombinant genotype 
It was therefore meaningful to try to obtain quantitative estimates of recombination from our data Our aim was to analyze viral recombination in a live host 
Consequently  we had to deal with the fact that more than one viral replication cycle occurred during the   d that infection lasted in our experiment  we had to wait that long for the disease to develop and to be able to recover sufficient amounts of viral DNA from each infection 
Based on the kinetics of gene expression    we postulate that each replication cycle lasts between   and   d  and that therefore seven to ten cycles occurred between infection and the sampling time 
In case this assumption is incorrect  we did calculations assuming five  seven  ten  or   replication cycles during these   d  As shown  the results were not affected qualitatively  and only slightly quantitatively 
It is important to note that we assumed that recombination occurred through a template switching mechanism  and that therefore  from a recombination point of view  the CaMV genome is linear 
The reverse transcription starts and finishes at the position   in Figure   which is the point of circularization of the DNA genome 
This implies that changes between contiguous markers a–b  b–c  and c–d can be considered as true recombination whereas those between a and d cannot  as they may simply stem from circularization of DNA  during the synthesis of which the polymerase has switched template once anywhere between a–b  b–c  or c–d To estimate the recombination rate between markers  we wrote recurrence equations describing the change in frequency of each genotype over one generation  assuming random mating and no selection  i e  the standard Wright–Fisher population genetics model 
We then expressed the frequency of all possible genotypes n generations later as a function of their initial frequency and of the recombination parameters 
Subsequently we calculated the maximum likelihood estimates of the recombination parameters and their asymptotic variances given initial frequencies  we assumed that the two  parental  genotypes  Mark S and Cabb S  had equal initial frequencies of   and that all other genotypes had initial frequencies of zero  and frequencies after n generations  the observed frequencies  as stated above we used different values of n 
All algebraic and numerical calculations were carried out with the software Mathematica The recombination parameters are the recombination rates between two adjacent loci  e g  r
  for the recombination rate between markers a and b  and the interference coefficients  e g  i
  for interference between recombination events in the segments between markers a and b and b and c  To define these parameters we followed Christiansen    and in particular the recombination distributions for two  three  and four loci  respectively  Tables     and   of   
It is important to realize that given the definitions of these parameters  the estimator of the recombination rate between two loci is not affected by the number of loci considered 
In other words  we obtain the same estimation of the recombination rate between markers a and b whether we consider genotypic frequencies at just these two loci  or the frequencies at these two loci plus a third locus  or the complete information to which we have access  the four marker genotypes 
Information on additional loci only affects the estimates of the interference coefficients It proved impossible to carry out the calculations for four loci algebraically 
Instead  we used a computer program to calculate the expected genotypic frequencies at all four loci after n generations  given the above stated initial frequencies and specified recombination parameters 
For each combination of recombination parameters we calculated a Euclidean distance between the vector of the expected genotypic frequencies and the observed genotypic frequencies  and considered that the estimated recombination parameters were those yielding the minimal Euclidean distance 
In all cases  the estimated recombination rates between pairs of loci were equal to the second decimal to those estimated algebraically from data for three or two loci Tumor Restrictions to Oncolytic VirusIn most solid tumors the tumor interior displays a high cellular density with multiple cell types  both malignant and normal  stromal  cells  interdigitated by strands of extracellular matrix  ECM  and other poorly defined tissue 
Stromal cells typically consist of fibroblasts  macrophages  neutrophils and other immune cell types 
Tumor associated fibroblasts are a source of the bulk acellular tissue in tumors    which is largely made up of polysugars and glycoproteins  such as collagens  laminins  fibronectins  proteoglycans  hyaluronan and water  forming a dense matrix around and between the cancer cells   
This matrix provides structural support but also haptotactic and chemotactic guidance for cancer cells   
Moreover  the prevailing tumor interstitium is rich in soluble angiogenic factors  such as members of the vascular endothelial growth factor  VEGF  family    cellular growth factors  including endothelial growth factor  EGF  basic fibroblast growth factor  FGF  platelet derived growth factor  PDGF  and pleiotrophic factors  particularly transforming growth factor  TGF  beta   
Additionally  both tumor  and stromal cells secrete cytokines and chemokines  such as interleukin  IL    IL   tumor necrosis factor  TNF  alpha  stromal cell derived factor  SDF    macrophage migration inhibitory factor  MIF    which on one hand recruit more stromal and progenitor cells into the tumors and on the other hand curb the activity of antigen presenting cells and anti tumor T cells   
In several independent cancer types  high serum levels of IL   and IL   are indicators of poor prognosis   Aberrant tumor and stromal growth combined with an overproduction of matrix leads to high interstitial pressure in the tumor  preventing lateral diffusion of therapeutic compounds within the tumor 
Tight cellular compactness combined with a high tumor proliferation rate also causes physical crowding and puts constraints on oxygenation  which due to aberrant angiogenesis and rupture of the haphazard vessels is mostly incomplete and results in chronic tissue hypoxia toward the tumor cores 
As cancer cells exist in a crowding hypoxic  and cytokine growth factor perpetuated chronic state of stress  they upregulate a number of key cellular molecules that function as a collective defense against a wide range of therapies  including oncolytic viruses 
The properties of oncolytic viruses and their status in clinical development as well as various delivery options have been reviewed elsewhere   
In this review  we provide an overview of two of the main intratumoral barriers to oncolytic virus spread  the extracellular tumor make up and the intracellular antiviral defense mechanisms Tumor cellular structure and composition may in concert with abundant extracellular matrix  ECM  deposition pose a severe hurdle for systemic virus entry and propagation of infection within the tumor 
The extracellular matrix is a complex dense network consisting of multiple proteins  glycoproteins and polysaccharides including collagens  laminins  fibronectins  proteoglycans and hyaluronic acid   
The interstitial fluid pressure  IFP  in the tumor surrounding blood and lymphatic vessels is mainly created by the high cell density that forms an increased physical pressure outwards and does not allow free diffusion of therapeutics   
A high IFP generally predicts an aggressive tumor phenotype as tumor cells tend to escape from tumor margins where the pressure drops  thus facilitating spread of metastatic cells   
On the other hand  for therapeutic virus  interstitial fluid concentration gradients may pose a hurdle as passive diffusion in viable regions  typically the rim  may occur mainly outward   
Given the limited arsenal of known chemicals alleviating tumor compactness and the poor penetration drugs in general into the tumor tissue  this is a considerable problem that may not be easy to tackle 
Some strategies are discussed below Viruses are passive particles and rely either on radial cell to cell spread or on soluble diffusion across concentration gradients to reach their target cells and to propagate the infection 
Tumor matrix is critical in this regard  as it can block both forms of spread 
Passively diffusing viruses may physically not fit through the strands of the ECM 
This was shown for oncolytic herpes virus  which has an outer diameter of over   nm  and whose spreading could be improved by matrix degrading bacterial collagenase co injection   
Bilbao and coworkers showed that adenovirus entry into experimental hepatocellular carcinoma nodules in the livers of immunocompetent rats following intravenous or intraportal injection was directly related to the thickness of the ECM capsule enveloping the nodules   
On the other hand  we found using Semliki Forest virus  which has an outer diameter of about   nm  that even upon intratumoral injection spread was blocked by ECM  which formed a physical barrier for virus infection  Figure  The foremost option to reduce interstitial fluid pressure and to remove physical molecule barriers imposed by the ECM is to use matrix degrading enzymes 
These act by digesting collagen  fibrin  and other types of fibrillar matrix deposits  creating more space between cell clusters  and glycosaminoglycan polymers  known to limit fluid movement in tumors 
Simultaneously  such strategies may also expose more cell surface to viruses  increasing the likelihood of infection 
In a study by Kuriyama  trypsin or collagenase dispase was injected into subcutaneous U  and U  glioma xenografts in immunocompromised mice  followed by a reporter adenovirus   
Both types of ECM degrading enzymes increased tumor transduction by the virus  but when doses got too high  transduction efficacy suffered  demonstrating a balance between ECM degradation and oncolytic virus efficacy 
In another study  treatment of PC  tumors with vaccinia virus producing matrix metalloprotease  MMP    resulted in reduction of collagen IV fibrils and increase in virus penetration into tumor  which yielded elevated virus titers   
Hong et al 
targeted orthotopic neuroblastoma xenografts engineered to express MMP  with oncolytic HSV  achieving increased virus distribution compared to control tumors   
Similar results were obtained when human soft tissue sarcoma HSTS T overexpressing MMP  or MMP  were injected with oncolytic HSV   
MMP expressing tumors contained significantly less sulfated glycosaminoglycans compared to control tumors 
Other enzymes and protein effectors  either engineered into virus expression cassettes or provided exogenously  include hyaluronidase  decorin  various other MMPs  and notably relaxin a peptide hormone normally expressed during particular phase of pregnancy that does not possess tissue degrading activity itself  but instead induces a number of key collagen degrading proteases seemingly in a tumor specific manner   
Beyer showed that relaxin expressed by murine stem cells improved trastuzumab penetrance and therapy outcome in syngeneic tumor models   
In another study  chimeric adenovirus Ad  expressing relaxin showed increased tumor transduction and virus dissemination   Several other strategies to increase penetration of therapeutics in tumors have been developed   
While the stromal ECM capsule of tumor nodules acts as a physical barrier to virus entry following intravenous injection  it was possible to improve tumor infection by administering vaso active compounds  angiotensin II  histamine  nitroglycerine  before the virus   
This is interesting  as vasculature per se would not be expected to alter or influence the physical composition of the ECM  such as collagen strand thickness 
Instead  virus access to the tumor was improved  most likely by increased access from the blood via tumor stromal adjoining vessels 
Interestingly  in a study with oncolytic herpes virus  anti VEGF monoclonal antibody Bevacizumab given before intravenous virus injection gave poorer anti tumor efficacy than when given after the virus   
The study showed that while HSV is able to enter and infect tumors better through their leaky vasculature compared to Bevacizumab normalized vasculature  vascular normalization by Bevacizumab still gave superior combination efficacy when the virus was already in the tumor 
This effect was likely dependent on altering both physical and biological properties of the tumor  including interstitial pressure and oxygenation 
In another study  anti VEGF A antibody injections in nude mice harboring U  human glioma xenografts led to an increase in MMP  expression and reduction in collagen fiber content  facilitating improved distribution of oncolytic adenovirus within the tumor tissue   
In general  targeting tumor vasculature by oncolytic viruses and including agents that affect tumor vasculature in combination regimens is gaining interest    and it will be interesting to see more specific studies on how vascular acting agents may affect the physical barriers to oncolytic viruses Some viruses do not need an extracellular step for propagating infection  such as members of the herpes and poxvirus families  and may be able to spread from cell to cell 
For example  HSV  is able to infect neighboring cells via lateral tight junctions in a manner dependent on its glycoproteins E and I   
Vaccinia virus  on the other hand  induces so called actin tails  which are actin filament driven membranous protrusions of the plasma membrane harboring a single virus particle at the outer tip 
These actin tails actively deliver and deposit virus particles onto or even into neighboring cells   
Because lateral spread without an extracellular step may circumvent neutralizing immunity as well as some of the physical obstacles the tumor microenvironment imposes  this ability has been engineered into viruses that normally do not possess it 
A promising strategy is to engineer OVs to express membrane fusogenic genes  MFGs  such as gibbon ape leukemia virus  GALV  glycoprotein  reptilian reovirus p  protein  FAST  or the membrane glycoproteins H and F of measles virus   
Quite intriguingly  expression of several different MFGs by oncolytic adenovirus synergized with chemotherapy in anti tumor efficacy both in vitro and in vivo    suggesting that membrane fusion facilitated lateral spread of also chemotherapeutics  which otherwise would not have occurred in a compact tumor 
The potential limitation of cell to cell dependent spread  however  may be that membrane free physical barriers  such as the ECM  may still pose a barrier to spread 
Also  it is unclear whether MFGs or other mechanisms of lateral spread may assist in reaching distant tumor nests Some other strategies to alleviate matrix imposed restrictions to oncolytic viruses have been discussed elsewhere   Tumors of epithelial origin mostly retain the firm cellular integrity seen in their original adhesive intercellular configuration 
Several viruses use cellular receptors which are located in paracellular tight junctions  which may be problematic in tightly packed tumors   
Adenovirus C group viruses use coxsackie adenovirus receptor  CAR  as their primary entry point  whereas adenovirus B  group members and measles virus Edmonston use CD  complement binding molecule as their cellular receptor   
Adenovirus B  group  serotypes       and   entry occurs using desmoglein   DSG    
Of these  CAR and DSG  are preferentially located within tight junctions and are hidden from virus binding   
Also the complement receptor CD  was ascribed a role in maintenance of epithelial cell integrity by interactions with the E cadherin catenin network   
These observations imply that before reaching the potential entry site on the tumor cell the virus must find its way into the junctional space 
Moreover  it has become increasingly clear that for example glioma tumors traditionally targeted by Ad  serotype adenoviruses often express only low levels of CAR and instead much higher levels of CD    Beyond that tight junctions hide multiple virus receptors  they contain a network of adhesion molecules  including ZO  cadherins  claudins and occludin  which  if perturbed  is associated with more aggressive disease in many types of cancer   
Since tight junctions also contain important receptors that mediate tumor promoting signaling and which have been targeted by monoclonal antibodies  notably Her  it would be highly useful to develop strategies that temporarily loosen the tight junction contacts even at cost of a transient increase in tumor metastatic risk 
One of the most interesting approaches has been to exploit the natural propensity of adenovirus serotype   which as part of its natural life cycle creates dodecahedral particles  PtDd  consisting of viral capsid proteins  penton base and fiber that open tight junctions by binding to and dissolving desmoglein  dimers and reducing E cadherin expression  to develop a specific tight junction opening molecule  JO    
Adenovirus type   uses PtDds to promote its own infection  opening the tight junctions ahead of infection to maximize access to desmoglein 
Analogously  when administered to human tumor xenografts  JO  facilitated penetration of trastuzumab much deeper into the tumor tissue than when the monoclonal antibody was administered on its own   
Moreover  JO  synergized with several chemotherapeutics in solid tumor models   
Backed by our own findings with oncolytic SFV  showing that both extracellular matrix and tumor cell compactness restrict virus spread and oncolytic efficacy  we believe combination approaches that target both tight junctions and extracellular matrix will prove effective in future virotherapy development  Figure  An alternative approach to increasing tumor penetration by oncolytic viruses is to alter tumor cell morphology and status 
Notably  cell death and in particular the type of cell death induced by virus has been shown to affect virus distribution within a tumor mass  in a study by Nagano et al  administration of apoptosis inducing paclitaxel before injecting oncolytic herpes simplex virus increased virus dissemination in the tumor  allowing its diffuse in  tunnels  created by shrinking dying tumor cells   Maintenance of physiological adherence is essential for proper ECM function and for retaining cellular integrity 
Therefore  a potential caveat of using ECM degrading proteolytic enzymes or tight junction openers is the risk of neoplastic cell detachment from the tumor ECM and increased risk of metastasis 
While ECM degradation or tight junction opening may operate innocuously  there is also a chance that loss of E cadherins via proteases or via non specific deregulation of tight junction integrity during ECM modulating therapy could trigger pro tumorigenic Wnt β catenin signaling  possibly driving epithelial to mesenchymal transition   
One study showed that ectopic relaxin expression stimulated MMP expression and enhanced breast cancer invasiveness    whereas another paper found short term relaxin exposure to increase breast cancer cell motility whereas long term expression reduced both motility and cancer invasiveness   
In the context of oncolytic viruses  Lavilla Alonso tested several proteases  including hyaluronidase  relaxin  and macrophage metalloelastase  and showed they all could assist adenovirus entry into tumors  yet  the authors did not detect treatment induced metastases or increase in tumor invasiveness   
Another strategy possibly balancing some of the putative risks of tight junction disruption could be to use Wnt dependent oncolytic viruses   Tumors are invariably fenestrated by host fibroblasts  myeloid cells and other non transformed cells  which driven by cancer induced cues can adopt various reprogrammed phenotypes to promote tumor angiogenesis and growth and to alter tumor responses to therapies   
As most of them normally play a role in immune homeostasis and pathogen sensing  they also respond to and influence oncolytic virus infection of tumors Fulci et al 
reported that injection of oncolytic HSV  directly into glioblastoma tumor parenchyma triggered upregulation of CD  and CD  monocytic markers and rapid clearance of virus  likely executed by infiltrating phagocytic cells   
When clodronate liposomes were used to deplete macrophages in vivo  the authors observed a  fold increase in virus titers in the brain tumors concomitant with an   reduction in peripheral CD  macrophages in animal spleens  suggesting that CD  cells migrate into the tumors upon virus injection and limit overall oncolytic efficacy 
While CD  cells were not reduced by peripheral macrophage depletion  arguing that these cells had been recruited to the tumors before the treatment  they could be eliminated in live glioma slices ex vivo  resulting in a  fold increase in virus replication 
Macrophages may secrete antiviral type I interferon constitutively at very low  subnanomolar  levels   and recently Liu et al 
showed that tumor resident CD  macrophages induced a protective antiviral state in ovarian and breast tumors which led to resistance to oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus  VSV  infection   
Type I IFN signaling  JAK  inhibitor Ruxolitinib reversed the resistance  facilitating VSV replication in the macrophage protected cancer cells 
It is tempting to speculate that tumor resident macrophages also rendered syngeneic GL  and DBT mouse gliomas completely refractory to VA  oncolytic alphavirus  as these cells were quite infectable in vitro and live glioma slices regained their sensitivity to virus within   h  indicating dilution of IFN I   Macrophages or the closely related myeloid suppressor cells are the predominant stromal cell type in many tumors and are actively recruited during cancer progression   
Heavy macrophage presence in the tumors indicates that such tumors may be resistant to oncolytic virotherapy  unless depleting preconditioning would be used 
Moreover  as part of the early immune response to virus infection  monocytic cells are rapidly recruited to tumors following intratumoral virus injection 
In one study  depletion of either CD b  cells or VEGF secreted by these cells in mice treated with oncolytic HSV  greatly increased oncolytic efficacy  tentatively linking pro tumorigenic and antiviral angiogenic mechanisms   Another key pro tumorigenic signaling employed by many tumors is up regulation of CXCR  the receptor for chemokine CXCL   also known as SDF  and recruitment of stromal cells expressing CXCL  which maintain the tumor and recruit additional cells to support tumor expansion and invasion  such as endothelial cell progenitors which contribute to neovascularization   
Indeed  high CXCR  expression is a negative prognostic factor for many cancers 
Oncolytic vaccinia virus engineered to express a soluble antagonist of CXCR  showed improved intratumoral virus replication  increased vascular disruption and a markedly reduced infiltration of the tumors by putative immune suppressive and tumor promoting stromal cells   
This study highlights how reducing pro tumor stromal cell effects may alleviate antiviral resistance and yield increased overall therapeutic efficacy 
On the other hand  if the paracrine antiviral effects of tumor homing monocytic cells could be selectively abrogated these cells could favorably be used to ferry oncolytic viruses into tumors 
Indeed  a significant delay in metastatic tumor potential was achieved when macrophages were harnessed to deliver a tumor specific oncolytic adenovirus   What is the antiviral status in human cancer 
Recent analyses from different normal cells that occupy the same organ reveal striking functional variation in components of the type I IFN signaling pathway that correlate with the tissue tropism and virulence of some virus strains   
Can similar variation in such components be found in cancer cells  or do cancer cells make an exception Transformed cells undergo selective elimination by the immune system before becoming cancerous  termed immunoediting  based on observations of differential capacity of immunocompetent mice to reject tumors previously grown in immunocompromised hosts versus syngeneic animals   
Cancer cell responsiveness to type I and type II IFNs plays a role during immunoediting  cancer cells that eventually progress to form a tumor display reduced capacity to respond to IFN gamma  which otherwise would upregulate MHC class I molecules and render the tumors amenable to CD  T cell mediated destruction  whereas responsiveness to type I interferon initially helps tumors avoid immune purging during the editing phase and is then irrelevant   
Of note  the anti tumor effects of type I IFN  still exploited today in several cancers  were shown to depend on host NK cells  and mice in which IFNAR was blocked by monoclonal antibody failed to reject even highly immunogenic tumors  as opposed to mice treated with control antibody  who all rejected the immunogenic tumor challenge   
Thus  whereas tumor responsiveness to type I IFN is not predetermined after immunoediting  other factors post immunoediting may influence it In several tumor types  varying levels of expression of components of the type I IFN signaling cascade have been detected  and in some tumor types these components have been found to have prognostic value  whereas in others they do not seem to influence survival   
However  emerging data suggests that antiviral genes may predict poor survival because they increase treatment resistance 
In one study  poor prognosis of several types of cancer due to genotoxic treatment resistance was found to correlate with increased activity of IFN I pathway genes   
In this study  a triad of type I IFN signaling pathway genes  STAT  ISG  and IFIT  formed a pan tumor type negative prognostic factor  and a broader seven gene cluster established negative prognostic criteria for treatment resistant breast cancer 
Treatment resistance was subsequently shown to depend on STAT  signaling  STAT expressing tumor clones were positively selected in animals in vivo  demonstrating increased proliferation and metastatic potential  and STAT expression mediated resistance against genotoxic assault by doxorubicin or ionizing radiation  knockdown of STAT  resulted in lower proliferation rate and metastatic capacity and increased sensitivity to genotoxic stress    
In another study  resistance to epigenetic DNA modifiers  AZA dC  a methyltransferase inhibitor  and LBH  or MGCD  both histone deacetylase  HDAC  inhibitors  was correlated with increased expression of IFN I pathway genes in small lung cancer cells   
Basal IFN related gene expression in several different SML cell lines was upregulated Interestingly  in many cancers  STAT proteins are not phosphorylated and persist in unphosphorylated form  U STAT 
Like its phosphorylated counterpart  U STAT  increases expression of genes contributing to resistance to DNA damaging agents   
While it is currently unknown why cancers may prefer to use unphosphorylated forms  it is known that U STATs activate distinct signals compared to their phosphorylated counterparts 
However  importantly for oncolytic viruses  in many tumors  constant expression and release of type I IFN leads to a constitutively high level of unphosphorylated forms of STAT  STAT  and IRF  which together form an unphosphorylated but functional ISGF like complex that relocalizes to the nucleus and drives expression of a specific set of ISGs distinct from acute IFN I exposure   
These ISGs are sufficient to maintain a functional antiviral defense and they play a critical role in resistance to DNA damaging agents On a cellular level  virus replication is controlled by antiviral defense molecules    which in turn are primarily controlled by type I IFN signaling 
In addition to classical type I IFN  or cytokine induced antiviral signaling  tumors may employ other antiviral defense mechanisms 
For example  stromal cells may secrete peptides with antiviral properties called defensins   
The defensins are amphiphatic and typically  –  amino acids in length and interfere with viruses by physically binding to and disrupting virus particles and or by inducing antiviral responses in target cells via pattern recognition receptors 
At least oral squamous cell carcinomas were found to overexpress defensins compared to normal control tissues   
While the role of defensins in oncolytic virus infection of tumors is unclear  one study showed that the immune stimulating properties of defensins may be exploited to increase overall therapeutic efficacy 
In this study  expression of beta   defensin from a conditionally replicating adenovirus yielded a superior therapeutic entity compared to the unarmed parental virus via enhanced anti tumor immune responses mediated by TLR dependent activation of dendritic cells   In summary  human cancers display varying degrees of expression of antiviral proteins or their signaling regulators at baseline 
Some of these may increase in response to genotoxic anti cancer treatments 
In the next chapter we will highlight some of the consequences to oncolytic virotherapy of the heterogeneity in type I IFN responsiveness in tumor cells All oncolytic viruses tested to date display variable infectivity in different cancer cell lines 
This variability is likely at least partly dependent on type I IFN as most oncolytic viruses are IFN sensitive 
IFN secretion follows virus sensing by the cells via Toll like receptors expressed on both the plasma membrane and in endocytotic vesicles  NOD like receptors  STING  AIM  NLP inflammosome and other danger sensing molecules  summarized elsewhere   
While all viruses carry an arsenal of counteracting molecules    no virus goes completely undetected 
Even HSV amplicons  which are devoid of functional virus genes  induce a type I IFN response that mediates a STAT dependent system wide antiviral defense in mice within one hour of intravenous vector injection  resulting in significant reduction of transgene expression compared to expression in STAT  knockout animals   During our own studies with attenuated SFV vector VA  it became apparent that the dramatic and lasting therapeutic efficacy achieved following mere single intravenous  or intratumoral  injection of the virus in immunocompromised mice bearing human A  melanoma or U  glioma xenografts   was not going to be recapitulated easily in immunocompetent animals   
The paradox in our studies was that while oncolytic SFV vector VA  effectively replicated in and destroyed a variety of IFN responsive cancer cell lines in vitro  it consistently failed to eradicate tumors generated from the same cell types in vivo  even if large doses of virus were injected directly into the tumor mass and even if the tumors were void of visible physical barriers  Figure  
Conversely  only tumors generated from IFN unresponsive cancer cells have seemed infectable in vivo by VA  so far 
In light of earlier findings by others  showing that type I IFN receptor knockout mice are highly susceptible to SFV infection and quickly succumb to multi organ systemic infection    the parameters for oncolytic SFV efficacy seem clear  tumor cells must be defective in type I IFN response for the virus to be effective These findings are in line with emerging data from other groups  showing a remarkably strict dependence of oncolytic virus replication on defective type I IFN responsiveness  a dogma introduced at the turn of the  st century   
For example  sarcomas and melanomas display differing permissiveness to oncolytic VSV  an obstacle which may be overcome by blocking type I IFN signaling   
In eight sarcoma cell lines  basal up regulation of RIG I and IFIT  and rapid induction of STAT  phosphorylation upon IFN I treatment correlated with resistance to oncolytic measles virus   
In other studies  human pancreatic and ovarian cancer cells display resistance against Rb dependent oncolytic adenovirus  strongly correlating with intracellular levels of MxA  and acquired resistance to repeated oncolytic adenovirus injections in an intraperitoneal ovarian carcinoma model was associated with an increase in MxA as well as several other key ISGs in the tumors   
A study comparing normal human or mouse melanocytes to a panel of melanoma cells revealed strong correlation between permissiveness to oncolytic VSV and capacity to mount antiviral defense in response to type I IFN   
In this study  VSV rp  harboring two mutations in P and L genes  was superior to several other tested oncolytic VSV strains  but the dependence on defective IFN responsiveness was still retained 
In yet another study  oncolytic VSV replicated in four out of twelve mesothelioma cell lines which were unable to mount antiviral defense upon IFN beta pretreatment or to respond to infection by up regulation of PKR  MxA or  OAS mRNA   
In contrast  the non permissive mesothelioma cells mounted antiviral defense  associated with PKR  MxA or  OAS mRNA up regulation  in response to infection or to exogenous type I IFN 
The authors of this study further linked the observed pattern of virus resistance to clinical mesothelioma samples  where in a mesothelioma tissue array  significant variance in immunoreactivity against PKR  p  and or IFNAR was observed  with only a few samples displaying lack of reactivity against all three components  arguing that most tumors in clinical settings would display at least some level of resistance to oncolytic VSV Oncolytic adenoviruses are often deleted for E A  which normally binds Rb and prevents it from sequestering E F  which results in the viruses being unable to replicate in normal cells 
However  since adenovirus  as with all viruses  contains elements that antagonize antiviral defenses  such elements have also been targets for deletion to render the virus sensitive to innate antiviral defenses  which would be expected to remain intact only in normal cells 
Cancer cells expressing Ras may down regulate protein kinase R and inhibit type I IFN induction by interfering with RIG I signaling   
Also  select interferon stimulated genes appear to be repressed by the Ras MEK ERK signaling cascade   
PKR activation shuts down E F dependent translation  including translation of virus messenger RNAs 
Therefore  an adenovirus deleted for VA RNA  which antagonizes PKR  should be capable of replicating in Ras overexpressing  tumor  cells 
However  while this was seemingly the case    it was later discovered that Ras is not an obligatory determinant for PKR inactivation and that virus replication was halted even in Ras overexpressing cells via functional PKR mediated E F phosphorylation  implying that the parameters of VA RNA deleted adenovirus replication had to be revised   
Similar findings were obtained with oncolytic reovirus  against which Ras independent tumor resistance emerged in vivo   
Thus  under some circumstances even tumor cells over expressing Ras may respond to type I IFN or to stimulants of pattern recognition receptors  activating PKR and inhibiting virus translation 
To complicate matters  MEK inhibitors have been shown restore antiviral signaling capacity in Ras overexpressing tumors   
This implies that human tumors treated with MEK inhibitors  such as Trametinib which was recently approved for treatment of BRAF mutated melanoma  may be poor targets for oncolytic viruses as antiviral signaling capacity in such tumors may be restored Some oncolytic viruses  such as members of the poxvirus family  are seemingly resistant to the antiviral effects of type I IFNs in vitro and may be controlled by other cellular factors   
However  in most cases  sensitivity or resistance to type I IFN is assessed in vitro and using only one cytokine  which may mask synergies with other factors present in vivo 
One possible explanation for the in vitro–in vivo discrepancy is the tumor micro environment  which not only imposes physical barriers to oncolytic viruses but also alters intracellular antiviral defenses 
For example  glioma cells were found in the brain to spontaneously secrete type I IFN  which conferred resistance against oncolytic HSV 
Resistance was linked to ECM protein CCN  interaction with glioma cell surface receptor alpha   beta   integrin  which activated interferon secretion   
It is tempting to speculate whether this or a similar ECM glioma interaction could have contributed to the resistance of syngeneic glioma cells we observed in vivo but not in vitro to both oncolytic SFV and vaccinia virus  FIG    
Also  while critical in many respects  antiviral signaling may occur without signaling via type I IFN receptor  IFNAR 
For instance  upon infection of IFNAR KO mice with murine hepatitis virus  MHV  brain cells were found to have upregulated antiviral GTPase TGTP and IFITm  and IFITm  all of which have confirmed antiviral activity in vivo against a variety of viruses   
In these cases  IFN gamma and TNF alpha likely account for at least part of the observed ISG activity  where e g  TGTP is upregulated by IFN γ signaling and TNFα has been shown to induce ISG  independently of IFNAR   Interestingly  while most cancers are heterogeneous in antiviral defence signaling  one broad class of tumors in particular may display consistently low capacity to ward off oncolytic viruses  oncovirus induced cancers 
This is because oncoviruses  as all viruses  carry a complement of factors that abrogate antiviral sensors and effectors  which may result in tumors that are uniformly devoid of antiviral signaling 
In an intriguing study  oncolytic VSV infected and destroyed human papilloma virus  HPV positive cervical carcinoma cells more effectively than HPV negative head  and neck cancer cells due to HPV E mediated suppression of antiviral signaling   
HPV positive or E expressing xenografts were efficiently eradicated from nude mice following VSV injection 
The potential of this approach is that even oncolytic viruses that are extremely sensitive to type I IFN  such as attenuated SFV or M mutated VSV  may function well against oncovirus induced cancers where the oncovirus machinery ensures the lack of antiviral defense While on first thought it would appear counterintuitive to antagonize the very factors that keep oncolytic viruses tumor specific  emerging data shows that this can be accomplished in a safe way 
One of the foremost strategies to increase oncolytic virus efficacy is to combine them with drugs that lower tumor antiviral defenses 
In this regard  a primary target for interference is the prototypical type I IFN signaling cascade 
While small molecular inhibitors against IFNAR are not available  activity of downstream signaling transducers may effectively be blocked 
Human pancreatic cancer cells were shown to constitutively express high levels of MxA and OAS and to mount type I IFN dependent resistance to oncolytic VSV 
Resistance could be overcome by blocking activity of IFNAR associated Janus kinase  JAK      
Similarly  JAK  inhibitor ruxolitinib overcame type I IFN dependent resistance of human SCC  head and neck cancer cells against oncolytic VSV   
Ruxolitinib also successfully abrogated type I IFN mediated antiviral effects elicited by macrophages    highlighting that this drug might also alleviate type I IFN dependent tumor resistance to oncolytic viruses imposed by stromal cells 
However  the obvious downside to using JAK inhibitors is their effects on critical host defense mechanisms  which may result in increased infection of normal cells 
Moreover  JAK inhibitors may reduce anti tumor immune responses elicited by oncolytic virotherapy 
For example  ruxolitinib was shown to impair the capacity of dendritic cells promote CD  T cell responses against model tumor antigens   
On the other hand  in this study clearance of adenovirus was delayed in ruxolitinib treated normal animals  which makes it difficult to predict the overall impact of JAK inhibitors on tumor therapy where prolonged virus presence might translate to better therapeutic efficacy 
Also  while the immune stimulating and anti tumor effects of type I and type II interferons may be adversely affected by JAK inhibitors  central tumor promoting cascades mediated by JAKs  such as IL STAT  may also be inhibited    yielding a difficult to predict net therapeutic outcome 
At the moment  more studies are needed to establish the overall impact of interference with JAK  signaling in cancer therapy Spurred by earlier reports of oncovirus reactivation and promoter enhancement by histone deacetylase  HDAC  inhibitors  this class of agents was assessed for capacity to enhance oncolytic virus potency by inhibiting antiviral responses 
Indeed  such enhancement was observed with oncolytic VSV and SFV  and while it has been difficult to pinpoint the exact mechanisms that underlie HDAC inhibitor enhancement of oncolytic virus replication in cancer cells  antiviral defenses in general are inhibited for yet unknown reasons mainly in cancer cells and not in normal cells  which indirectly facilitates virus replication   
Interestingly  combination of HDAC inhibitors with conditionally replicating   E A deleted adenovirus gave improved virus replication rate and therapeutic efficacy in subcutaneous xenograft models only when the inhibitors were given before the virus  otherwise inhibition of replication was observed   
Similarly  HDAC inhibitors increased replication and oncolytic efficacy of HSV when given before the virus but not when given at the same time   
With nuclear DNA viruses  such as adenovirus and HSV  it is possible that HDAC inhibitors also alter virus genome accessibility to transcription factors  resulting in reduced replication or other adverse effects  implying that with these viruses HDAC inhibitors should be administered before the viruses Recently  it was found that HDAC inhibitor vorinostat activates NfκB signaling by facilitating hyperacetylation of the p  subunit  which in turn activates cellular autophagy   
Autophagy was in another study shown to be important for VSV replication  presumably by inhibiting antiviral signaling 
This is interesting  as a previous study revealed enhancement of VSV replication by inhibiting TNF alpha induced antiviral signaling mediated by p  using NfκB inhibitors BMS  or TPCA    
In this study  neither inhibitor had an effect on STAT  or STAT  phosphorylation or their nuclear relocalization in response to type I IFN but the authors observed clear induction of ISG  GBP  and MX  in response to type I IFN in U  glioma cells  with the latter two being dependent on NfκB signaling 
Taken together  NfκB pathway activation may result in different antiviral responses in different cancer types  and inhibition or enhancement of oncolytic viruses by NfκB inhibitors is dependent on other concomitant cellular mechanisms  such as autophagy Since HDAC inhibitors modulate promoter activity accessibility  it is conceivable other epigenetic or promoter modifying agents could work in a similar manner to repress antiviral defense induction and enhance oncolytic viruses   
DNA demethylating agents  azacytidine  Aza  and decitabine synergized with oncolytic herpes simplex type   virus in glioma models in vitro and in vivo  as did HDAC inhibitor valproic acid  VPA  which was already shown before to work well with oncolytic HSV as well as several other oncolytic viruses   
Moreover  inhibition of cancer antiviral defenses  specifically RNAseL and PKR  resulted when cancer cells were exposed to sunitinib  a multi tyrosine kinase inhibitor originally developed as an inhibitor of VEGF R and PDGF R signaling  yielding strong anti tumor synergy with IFN sensitive oncolytic VSV   
Since sunitinib is approved for renal cell carcinoma and imatinib resistant gastric cancers  combination with oncolytic VSV constitutes a promising and clinically relevant approach warranting further investigation 
Interstingly  sunitinib as well as several other receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors displayed antiviral effects against polyomavirus BK    arguing that these compounds are not universal virus enhancers Cyclophosphamide  CPA  is a general immunosuppressant used to minimize Treg presence during immunotherapy and also oncolytic virotherapy 
CPA may  however  also enhance replication and efficacy of oncolytic viruses by diminishing cytokine secretion by stromal cells  including type I IFN   
Another compound enhancing oncolytic virus efficacy by lowering cell responsiveness to type I IFN is triptolide  which acts downstream of IRF  activation   
Further  the kinase mammalian target of rapamycin  mTOR  enhances the antiviral effects of type I IFN by activation of its effector proteins  E BP  which binds and inactivates translation factor eIF E  and S K  which carries out cell type specific signaling functions of type I IFN  such as activation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor  B and promotion of ISG  transcription 
Consequently  rapamycin was able to enhance oncolytic VSV replication and anti tumor efficacy by inhibiting type I IFN mediated antiviral signaling via mTOR   Several other compounds synergizing with oncolytic viruses have been identified via high throughput drug library screening  many of which seem to act by antagonizing antiviral defenses 
For instance  a novel virus sensitizer  Vse  was found to greatly diminish antiviral effects of type I IFN against oncolytic VSV in several cancer cell types  and the drug also synergized with the virus in subcutaneous mouse tumor models   
For many of these new compounds  the mechanism of action is still poorly understood  necessitating extensive safety studies to exclude undesirable effects against normal cells Apart from classical type I IFN induced antiviral defenses  which typically prevent virus translation and degrade virus genomes  other cellular machineries regulate oncolytic virus efficacy 
Notably  strategies to increase cancer cell death in response to oncolytic viruses have been tested 
In a recent study  a class of compounds called SMAC mimetics synergized in several cancer models with oncolytic VSV by removing cancer cell block to apoptosis in response to virus induced type I IFN  TNF α or TRAIL   
Interestingly  since virus infection triggered cytokines act on nearby non infected cells  SMAC mimetics may in combination with oncolytic viruses also cause significant bystander tumor destruction 
Normal cells are not affected by the IFN SMAC mimetic synergy  providing an important safety aspect 
In another study  blocking the ER stress response circuitry triggered by oncolytic rhabdovirus infection by a small molecular inhibitor of serine threonine protein kinase and endoribonuclease IRE α  which was identified in a genome wide siRNA screen  greatly enhanced cytotoxicity via caspase induced apoptosis and increased oncolytic efficacy in refractory tumor models in mice   
This effect was independent on induction or responsiveness to type I IFN 
Conversely  inhibitors of nucleoside transporter   ENT  were discovered from a high throughput screen of enhancers of oncolytic HSV  and to date such inhibitors have not been reported to alter cellular antiviral responses   
Other compounds  such as common chemotherapeutics  and their mechanisms synergizing with oncolytic viruses have been discussed elsewhere for most of them the possible role of antiviral defense antagonism in enhancing oncolytic virus efficacy remains to be studied   Thus  many compounds are available to interfere with tumor antiviral defenses 
The outstanding question for most of them  however  seems to be why such compounds do not render normal cells sensitive to oncolytic viruses 
Elucidation of the exact mechanisms of action and the differences between normal and cancer cells constitute a worthy goal for studies in the near future Already in the  s it became clear that using certain pathogenic wildtype viruses  such as West Nile virus and Bunyamwera virus  in cancer patients would result in off target toxicity   
Characteristic for pathogenic viruses is a greater ability to circumvent or antagonize cellular innate antiviral defenses than attenuated strains 
For example  unlike the prototypical oncolytic reovirus strain type   Dearing  the T L strain of reovirus causes accumulation of IRF  in the nucleus and inhibits activation of a select group of ISGs yet because of this property the T L strain is myocarditic unlike the oncolytic type   Dearing strain   
For these reasons  many oncolytic viruses used today  such as reovirus type   Dearing  oncolytic strains of Newcastle disease virus and M mutated VSV have either a stronger capacity to induce or a weaker capacity to resist antiviral type I IFN than the corresponding wildtype strains   An open question  however  is whether strain specific or virus specific differences that relate to specific components of the cellular antiviral machinery may be exploited for greater anti tumor efficacy  i e  if one virus fails  could another be used in its stead 
While Ras expression was critical for oncolytic reovirus replication in cells overexpressing CUG  oncogene  oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus was unable to replicate in the same cells due to increased activation of STAT  and OASL    
Thus  in these cells reovirus was not affected by STAT  or OASL  and it therefore remains interesting to see which other antiviral effectors may have been lacking in the CUG expressing cells and  conversely  how reovirus and VSV differ in terms of sensitivity to antiviral effectors 
While several oncolytic viruses have been compared to each other in terms of replication rate and cytotoxicity  systematic studies with regard to tumor antiviral defenses have not been conducted As any attenuated virus is likely to replicate effectively only in its own niche  i e  to be restricted by a specific set of ISGs  and as wild type strains may be too toxic for use in humans  a compromise may be achieved by incorporating select elements from wild type viruses into oncolytic virus backbones 
Indeed  several chimeric and recombinant viruses have been generated that harbor specific elements of wild type strains or even of other unrelated viruses in order to better resist cancer antiviral defenses  Table  
As an example of introducing wild type elements into attenuated viruses  Haralambieva reported on a measles virus Edmonston vaccine strain in which P gene was replaced with the counterpart from the wild type IC B strain   
Later  Meng et al 
included N  P  and L genes from wild type measles in Edmonston backbone  producing an enhanced but still safe oncolytic virus   
Edmonston vaccine virus induces a more robust IFN response compared to wild type measles virus partly due to the weaker ability of V protein to suppress MDA mediated activation of IRF  and IFN I induction   
In vivo  P gene encoded proteins  particularly V  control the quality of the cytokine response to measles so that vaccine strains qualitatively induce a stronger inflammatory response compared to WT strains  where WT V protein suppresses multiple cytokine secretion 
V protein short cytoplasmic tail has been shown to bind and inactivate STAT  IRF  MDA  and the Rel homology domain of the NfκB subunit p  but not of p    
Also  V causes LGP  protein to bind and inactivate RIG I    but it seemingly does not interfere with TICAM   TRIF  multiple TLR adaptor  including TLR mediated IFN β induction 
Thus  if cancer and normal cells would differ with regard to TICAM  or IRF  then such a virus could potentially target specifically cancer cells rather than normal cells 
So far  the measles Edmonston WT chimeras have proven safe in animals As an example of heterologous virus constructs  lentogenic Newcastle disease virus engineered to express influenza virus PR   H N  NS  showed enhanced oncolytic efficacy in vivo due to dampening of antiviral responses   
While such a virus did not display enhanced pathogenicity in that study  a mesogenic NDV virus harboring NS  from influenza strain H N  did show increased pathogenicity in chickens as well as an increased ability to replicate in human cells    raising some cautionary warnings for future engineering of similar replicative viruses 
As another example  vaccinia virus soluble type I IFN scavenger B R  NOTE  B R is often used in the literature  has been engineered into both oncolytic HSV and oncolytic rhabdoviruses  resulting in all cases in more effective therapy agents without loss of tumor specificity   
Oncolytic γ  gene deleted HSV was complemented by two different PKR antagonists from human cytomegalovirus  TRS  and IRS  generating a chimera capable of reaching wild type virus replication levels in cancer cells in vitro and in tumor models in vivo   The selection of various viral IFN I antagonists that potentially could be used to augment attenuated oncolytic viruses is vast   
For example  increased replication of several viruses  including HIV  Sindbis virus and E deleted adenovirus in mammalian cells was observed when the cells were engineered to express vaccinia virus E L protein  influenza A virus NS  protein  ebola virus VP  protein or HIV  Tat protein   
The choice of antagonist must primarily be made with safety in mind  but virus specific and cell specific differences in antagonist functions may potentially be exploited rationally when considering the overall combination 
For example  vaccinia virus E L is able to rescue VSV but not EMCV from exogenous IFN  whereas vaccinia virus K L partially rescued EMCV but not VSV   In anticipation of systematic  perhaps bioinformatically guided   super chimera  studies  two or more viruses that may complement each other s shortcomings in antiviral defense antagonism have been considered 
Notably  vaccinia virus was favorably combined with IFN I sensitive oncolytic VSV and SFV  yielding tumor model dependent increases in overall therapy efficacy that were dependent on vaccinia virus antagonism of type I IFN responses  which increased the replication of the IFN sensitive viruses   
Such heterologous virotherapy approaches may also be used to generate immunological synergy  similar to heterologous prime boost vaccination  anti tumor immune responses may be increased due to targeting of the tumor by two different viruses  on two separate occasions  but anti virus immune responses would be generated against different viruses each time  avoiding the problem of neutralizing immunity to and predominance of antivirus immune responses   
Some other ideas explored experimentally include engineering oncolytic viruses to express other oncolytic viruses 
For example  the entire oncolytic parvovirus H  genome was placed under a regulatable promoter in oncolytic adenovirus  resulting in a more effective therapeutic entity than either virus alone without loss of tumor specificity   
The genetic material of Semliki Forest virus replicons has been engineered into adenovirus and vaccinia virus backbones   and several other virus chimeras have been constructed   
However  the effects on tumor antiviral defenses of such a constructs remain to be studied The attribute  oncolytic  implies for a virus that it infects and  indeed  lyses the infected tumor 
This property is primarily tested in vitro in cultured tumor cells 
We have learned  however  that in the native tumor microenvironment in living hosts many viruses are no longer able to infect tumor cells or to kill them even if they manage to infect them 
Tightly packed tumor cells and the network of supportive molecules of the extracellular matrix form a physical barrier to virus particle diffusion 
It has also become evident that the tumor cells themselves may be much more capable of thwarting oncolytic virus advances than previously thought  with some tumor cells residing in a seemingly permanent non permissive antiviral state 
Tumors harbor multiple cell types in addition to the neoplastic cells  which may promote and propagate both physical and cellular virus resistance 
As the efficacy of virotherapy in human cancer patients still falls shy of the achievements in animal models  it appears quite plausible that one or more of the barriers described in this review indeed constitute a real and formidable obstacle for oncolytic virus advancement into routine clinical use 
Fortunately  some of the most difficult barriers have been identified  and a rapidly expanding arsenal of countermeasures is at our disposal 
Our task is now to separate the wheat from the chaff and to systematically evaluate the proposed combination regimens that will yield the best results without compromising patient safety Evidence of prenatal toxicity of herbal based indigenous formulations for sex selection in rat modelsTraditional or indigenous preparations  IPs  are getting considerable attention in global health debates  It continues to be used widely in several countries and its consumption is rapidly increasing 
 
  Many reports have documented the use of such preparations 
For instance  in China  traditional herbal medicines played a critical role during the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome  SARS  In fact  many drugs in modern medicine had their roots in the traditional system of medicine 
Drugs like Penicillin  from Penicillium fungi  and Digoxin  from Digitalis purpurea  are some such examples 
One of the promising therapies for Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus  MRSA  infection is a ninth century treatment for eye infections which is a recipe consisting of garlic and onions  wine  and bile from a cow s stomach brewed in a brass cauldron 
It is however important to note that culture specific practices are not always safe 
Digitalis is a classic example where herbalists use this plant in allopathic treatment strategies  while in some countries such as Britain  law restricts their vast availability  A report from Australia describes the adverse effects of ‘herbal  preparations or IPs  Problems arise when people do not report about the consumption of such preparations assuming that these are devoid of any side effects by virtue of them being natural products  The need for research in this field is huge and scientific research into the quality  safety  molecular effects and clinical efficacy is crucial 
 
 
Pregnancy is considered a time of minimal intervention  and a period when herbal medicines are usually contraindicated  It is reported that many women consume indigenous medicines  that contains Bryonia laciniosa  Quercus infectoria and Putranjiva roxburghii along with other ingredients  during early pregnancy to beget a male child in India 
These preparations  often called sex selection drugs  SSD  contain herbal ingredients but these are off the label prescriptions and hence cannot be certified as ‘herbal  medicines 
The prevalence of consumption varies from   to as high as         Studies have indicated that there is  –  times higher risk of birth defects including major malformations of internal organs like urogenital and renal malformation  trachea esophageal fistula  and visible defects like spina bifida  cleft lip palate and imperforate anus 
 
  Risk of stillbirths also increases   folds 
Studies suggest that a single exposure during pregnancy can be deleterious 
 
 
 
  SSDs are reported to contain phytoestrogens  steroids and heavy metals 
 
 
 
  It is also known that although placenta serves as a barrier  most drugs and environmental chemicals enter the foetal circulation by passive diffusion or active transport  However  despite growing evidence on deleterious effects of these herbal formulations  few studies have attempted to systematically understand the risk of such preparations using animal models 
Genetic sex of a child is determined at the time of conception by the fertilization of the ovum with X or Y sperms and intake of so called preparations for sex selection can never alter that In view of these  the current study was conducted with an objective to determine the embryo foetal and development toxicity of SSDs following maternal exposure during critical period of organogenesis using a small animal model The study was guided by the OECD guidelines for testing of chemicals  Guideline no    adopted on  nd January   Prenatal Developmental Toxicity Study  and was based on a mutually approved protocol 
Personal protection equipment was employed as required while handling the test system The test facility is registered and renewed  No 
 PO RcBi S CPCSEA dated July     for breeding and to conduct research on animals for commercial purpose by the committee for the purpose of control and supervision of experiments on animals  CPCSEA  Ministry of Environment  Forests and Climate Change  Government of India 
The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee  Venus Medicine Research Center 
Due permission was taken from the Ethics Committee of Indian Institute of Public Health Delhi For this experiment  strain of Sprague Dawley of rats  Rattus norvegicus  was used 
The number of dams per group was   instead of   as laid down under OECD guidelines 
Rats of both sexes  –  g  were obtained from National Institute of Biologicals  India at  –  weeks of age  acclimatized for five days and then subjected to the experiment at  –  weeks of age 
They were housed in standard polypropylene rat cages with stainless steel top grill  one dam per cage  at a temperature of       °C  with  –  relative humidity 
Bedding material and cages were changed once in six days and   hourly light dark cycle was followed 
Animals were identified by their existing ear numbering 
Cages were labelled by tags indicating the study number  sex  group of the animals  experimental start and completion dates 
Standard pelleted feed  from Ashirwad Industries  Mohali  India  was provided ad libitum to all the animals 
They also had free access to purified water via drinking bottles throughout the study 
The feed  cages and drinking bottles were not analysed for the presence of phytoestrogens and bisphenol A 
However  similar materials were used for all the rats across all groups The drug comprised of IPs for sex selection  SSD 
These non branded locally made preparations are made available  –  days after placing an order and are never sold openly 
These preparations essentially contain herbal ingredients such as Shivlingi  Bryonia laciniosa  Majuphal  Quercus infectoria  Putrajeevak  Putranjiva roxburghii  Nagkesar  Mesua ferrea  and feather of peacock  Pavo cristatus 
A total of   such samples of SSDs were procured from varied sources like ‘pansari  shop owners  grocers  local alternative medicine practitioners  rickshaw pullers  drivers and commoners from different states 
SSDs are advised to be consumed between   and   weeks of pregnancy The samples were categorized into   groups based on redundancy of the preparations and common ingredients reported 
This was followed by chemical analysis in an accredited laboratory to detect the presence of phytoestrogens and steroids 
Since we explored the toxic effects of these preparations we wanted to select two samples that would be most predictive of toxicity 
Due to resource constraints  we did not want to subject all the   samples for animal study 
Hence  three samples of SSDs  found to be most rich in phenols and steroids were selected for toxicity study  All the three samples were also tested for heavy metals which suggested that Lead and Mercury were in very high quantities  The toxicity was examined using C  elegans  an alternate animal model 
Survival analysis and reproductive toxicity was assessed from the brood size and progeny count assay  The two SSDs that were found to be most toxic were selected as test items for the subsequent study in rat models 
SSD   was reported to contain Shivlingi and Putrajeevak while SSD   contained Shivlingi  Majuphal  Putrajeevak  Nagkesar and feathers of peacock 
Both the samples were obtained from grocers 
Local preparations like these are bound to have certain degree of variability in concentrations but more often than not  these remain the major ingredients According to studies reported  women consume such preparations along with cow s milk in dosages and schedule that are quite varied 
While some advise these IPs to be consumed for one day  others prescribe it for   days  to be taken thrice a day 
We considered the amount of SSDs most commonly reported by pregnant women  weighing   kg  which was  –  g daily for   days 
The dose of the test item   mg kg  was calculated by using conversion factor of  Conversion factor is the ratio of the correction factors  estimated by dividing the average body weight in kgs of species by the body surface area in m  of the species  Km 
Human equivalent dose  HED in mg kg    Animal dose  mg kg  X correction factor  Km animal Km human 
Kms of every species are constant 
For humans it is    assuming average weight of adults to be   kg a surface area of   m  and for rats it is  Therefore  HED   mg  kg    animal dose X  
Or  animal dose         mg kg           mg kg Since pregnant women consume these orally  these were administered to rats by oral route The test items were coded as SSD   and SSD   and were provided to the experimental laboratory  Venus Medicine Research Center  Baddi  in powder form 
On the day of dosing  the doses were administered between  –  h  The test items were administered in fresh cow s milk at a final volume of   ml kg 
The doses were calculated on the basis of the latest body weight recorded for the study 
A stainless steel gavage cannula fitted to a calibrated syringe was used for dosing the animals For control animals  cow s milk was used as a vehicle while feeding The study was performed in two phases to evaluate the effect of SSD consumption duration during gestation period Adult  nulliparous female rats were mated with males of same species and strain in  
Each morning  dams were examined for the presence of a vaginal plug and vaginal smear was taken from each dam by using pipette smear technique 
The day of vaginal plug formation or sperms observed in vaginal smear  also known as successful mating  were considered as GD   Gestation day  
The mated females were housed individually in clear polycarbonate cages with stainless steel wire lids 
Mating process was carried out to result in   pregnant animals per group 
Successfully mated females were randomized into control and treatment groups 
All the rats were sacrificed on GD  
According to OECD guidelines  the test chemical should be administered daily from implantation to the day prior to scheduled caesarean section in order to assess toxicity 
Test chemicals were administered to pregnant animals and sacrificed as per the schedule  which was as close as possible to the normal day of delivery without risking loss of data resulting from early delivery i e GD  
The females were killed  before caesarean section  the uterine contents were examined  and the fetuses were evaluated for soft tissue and skeletal changes The pregnant rats were randomized to two intervention and one control groups 
SSD was given during pre implantation to implantation stage  GD  – 
Each group of rats was treated either with vehicle  G  VC  SSD   G    mg kg  or SSD   G    mg kg SSDs were given from GD  – 
Each group of rats was treated with either vehicle or SSD  or SSD 
Allocation of animals was randomized to the following groups  G   Control  VC  G   SSD    mg kg  G   SSD    mg kg  G   SSD    mg kg  G   SSD    mg kg  G SSD    mg kg  G   SSD    mg kg The following parameters were observed •Clinical Signs  Animals were observed once after successful mating or on GD  and after administration of the first dose 
Cage side observations for clinical signs of toxicity in the animals were recorded once daily until the day before necropsy •Body weight  Body weight of all experimental animals were recorded once before mating  initial body weight  and then after confirmation of mating 
Body weights were recorded on days               and on terminal day before sacrifice 
These recorded body weights were used for calculating the dose volume to be administered •Food consumption  Food consumption was evaluated once after successful mating or on day   of gestation  the day of vaginal plug formation or sperms observed in vaginal smear  and on days             and one day prior to sacrifice 
Calculated amount of feed were placed in the trough of each cage and the quantity of feed remaining after approximately   h were weighed and recorded •Morbidity Mortality  All the animals were observed twice daily  once in the morning between   and   h and once in the evening between   and   h  for incidence of morbidity and or mortality •Maternal examination related parameters  At the end of the observation period  all the dams were sequentially euthanized  by CO  asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation  and subjected to gross necropsy 
After termination  dams were examined macroscopically for any structural abnormalities or pathological changes 
Blinding was done while evaluation of the dams during caesarean section and subsequent foetal analyses to minimize bias 
Pregnancy rate was calculated as the proportion of mated pairs that had produced at least one pregnancy within a fixed period where pregnancy was determined by the earliest available evidence that fertilization has occurred 
Gestation index was calculated to indicate number of females with live born as a proportion of number of females with evidence of pregnancy •Examination of uterine contents  Immediately after termination  the uteri were removed and the pregnancy status of the animals ascertained 
Gravid uteri including the cervix were weighed  and number of corpora lutea were determined 
The uterine contents were examined for numbers of embryonic or foetal deaths and live foetuses 
The degree of resorption was described in order to estimate the relative time of death of the conceptus 
Any increase in the number of resorption and or implantation loss is an indicator of litter size for the individual dam •Examination of foetuses  The sex and weight of each foetus were determined 
Approximately one half of each litter were prepared and examined for skeletal alterations from selected dams 
The remainder were prepared and examined for soft tissue alterations  using accepted or appropriate serial sectioning methods or careful gross dissection techniques 
Each foetus was examined for external alterations 
Foetuses were examined for skeletal alterations  using Alizarin Red S staining method 
The fetuses for skeletal staining were kept in pre labelled plastic containers containing   ethanol before staining 
After skinning  we processed the foetus for staining by immersing in   alcian blue   GX for three days  then performed rehydration through a gradient series of ethanol   ethanol   –  h twice    ethanol   –  h  ethanol   –  h  distilled water until the samples sank to the bottom of a conical tube 
Samples were further treated with   KOH for  –  days or until it became clear and again treated with   alizarin red for next  –  days until bones became purple 
Samples were rinsed   times in   KOH  for  –  h at each time point 
Samples were further treated with a gradient series of glycerol  KOH    h   glycerol   h X  Visceral examination was done by micro dissection technique 
Fetuses were preserved in   formalin until they became fixed 
An illuminated magnifier was used for visceral examination 
We placed the foetus in a supine position on a paraffin wax block tray covered with paraffin wax  secured the fetal limbs by paper pins to the paraffin wax block  made a ventral midline incision from the umbilicus  cutting caudally to the genital tubercle and cranially to the diaphragm 
Once incision was completed  we located the ventral attachment of the diaphragm and lifted the liver carefully to examine the diaphragm for abnormal opening 
After observation  the diaphragm was clipped 
We gave a longitudinal cut to open the rib cage slightly lateral to and on the right of the sternebrae and then extended the cut anteriorly to neck region 
The rib cage was opened gently and secured to the paraffin block petridish tray with pins Foetuses were examined for soft tissue alterations  e g 
variations and malformations or anomalies  using Wilson s Technique 
The fetal viscera were examined sequentially  beginning with thoracic organs and moving caudally 
We performed hearts cuts after completion of other observations 
We examined the bilobed thymus for size  shape  coloration and presence of haemorrhages and then removed it for observation of trachea and esophagus 
We observed the lungs for size  color and number of lobes  observed the trachea  esophagus for normal alignment and presence of fistula  opened the pericardial sac and cut off pericardium to expose the heart for observation 
We checked the size  shape  color of the heart and normal development of major blood vessels 
After observation of thoracic viscera  we observed the abdominal viscera and liver for size  shape  color  texture  and number of lobes 
External anatomy of heart was examined by making two incisions using micro dissecting scissors We examined the stomach  spleen  pancreas  small and large intestines for size  position or any other developmental anomalies 
The intestines were moved aside after observation for seeing the underlying structures 
Ureters were checked for normal size and location and for continuity from the renal hilus to the urinary bladder 
One kidney was cut transversely and another was longitudinally to examine renal papilla and renal pelvis 
To confirm the sex of the foetus  the gonads were inspected carefully 
We examined the reproductive organs for size  shape and location GraphPad Prism® statistical software version   was used to analyze the data and all the results were represented as mean   S E M 
Intergroup variance for most of the parameters was calculated by one way analysis of variance  ANOVA  followed by Tukey s test 
A value of p     was regarded statistically significant 
Linear regression was performed to examine the weight change of dams during pregnancy for each group comparing with the control after adjusting for the litter size 
The malformations were analysed by performing Chi square test for trend for two groups  SSD  G  G  G  G  and SSD  G  G  G  G The ARRIVE guidelines were followed to report the findings 
In phase   pre natal study  all the dams dosed with SSD  and SSD  had normal food intake and weight gain 
The average gain in weight from GD  to GD   was       gms for controls while it was       gms in SSD   and       gms in SSD 
 Webtable  
No test item related mortality or clinical sign of toxicity was encountered during the study 
All dams in treatment groups and control group survived to scheduled terminal sacrifice 
They showed normal behaviour until euthanized 
There were no differences in mean maternal body weights  body weight gains  pregnancy rate  gestational index  pre and post implantation loss  and resorptions 
No significant differences were observed in foetal sex ratio  foetal body weights 
However  one dam from SSD  had all male foetuses 
No abnormality was detected in skeletal and visceral examination In phase   controls and SSD  and SSD  treated dams exhibited a comparable food intake  Table  
 
However  a dose response relationship was observed with reduced weight gain with higher doses of SSDs 
 Table  
 
Two dams  one in G   SSD    mg kg  and the other in G   SSD    mg kg  categories showed decreased or consistent body weight GD  onwards 
On an average  the weight on GD   was       gms in controls while it was       with SSD    mg kg  and       gms with SSD    mg kg 
The adjusted analysis indicated that except in G  there was a significant reduction in weight gain in all the intervention groups as compared to the control group after controlling for litter size  Table  
 During follow up  one dam from SSD    mg kg  and one from SSD    mg kg  showed haematuria during gestational day  – 
However  no another clinical sign of toxicity was encountered during the study 
All the dams in treatment and control groups showed normal behaviour and survived to scheduled terminal sacrifice 
In phase   pregnancy rate and gestational index were found to be   at all dose levels with SSD  whereas  in SSD  it decreased to   in G   SSD    mg kg  and G   SSD    mg kg  groups 
One dam from G   SSD    mg kg  and another one from G   SSD    mg kg  group showed mating confirmation during vaginal smear examination and showed positive sign in initial days of pregnancy but during necropsy on expected day of delivery  GD   no foetus was found 
Body weights of dams increased in the initial stages that became constant at a later period 
To reconfirm it  non gravid uterus was stained in salewski strain and presence of conceptus was found 
This indicated the possibility of miscarriage Increased pre and post implantation losses as well as resorptions and reduced live foetuses were observed with both SSD  and SSD 
No significant differences were observed in foetal sex ratio  but decreased foetal body weights were noted in both sexes 
On an average one early resorption in a group was a normal observation 
More than one late resorption was observed in all treatment groups while there was none in the control group 
Total count of live foetuses count was significantly reduced with SSD  and SSD  treatment in a dose dependent manner 
Total number of live foetuses were reduced up to   in SSD  at   mg kg treatment group and   in SSD  at   mg kg treatment group Both SSD  and SSD s at different dose levels showed decreased fetal weight in dose dependent manner  although the difference was not significant 
Skeletal and soft tissue alterations were observed in both treatment groups 
In general  the embryo–foetal examination showed abnormalities  which could have caused some functional damage to these foetuses if allowed to grow in the normal course 
In visceral examinations  slight dilation of the renal pelvis  reduced papilla size  urinary bladder hypertrophy was observed in few foetuses from both SSD  and SSD  treatment groups 
Few incidences of foetal soft tissue abnormalities encountered in this study were normal variants 
Skeletal examination showed variations in the ossification patterns like incomplete or poorly ossified skulls  ossification of sternebra  cleavage ossification of thoracic centrum  asymmetric thoracic centrum  and supernumerary rib in many foetuses in SSD  and SSD  groups  Table  
 
A trend was noted with increased incidence of certain malformations with increasing dosages of SSDs that was statistically significant for most malformations with SSD The results of this developmental toxicity study suggest that administration of SSDs to pregnant rats had significant impact on intrauterine foetal growth  early and late resorption as well as developmental anomalies 
These formulations have teratogenic potential but does not affect sex ratio IPs contain phytoestrogens like diadzein and genistein  In vitro rat whole embryo culture assay  WEC  studies of genistein in rats have indicated fetotoxic and teratogenic potential at concentration of ≥  μg mL  However  in vivo  an oral  gavage  embryonic and fetal development pilot study could not demonstrate any teratogenic effect in the same study 
These findings are different from our study probably because we used SSDs containing natural herbal and non herbal ingredients unlike those studies where synthetic genistein was used 
In both the studies  decreased body weight was observed indicating slight maternal toxicity 
Food consumption was unaffected in our study which is contrary to what was reported 
In another study  pregnant rats exposed to oral isoflavones  diadzein and genistein in varying combinations  showed alterations in the number of live foetuses  lysed foetuses  number of resorption sites  and implantation sites while no clinical signs suggestive of maternal toxicity  seizures  tremors and salivation  that was observed similar to our study 
Maternal mass gain was significantly reduced in rats treated with   mg kg of isoflavones  Ratio of females to males in the litter of different groups was similar akin to our finding  These observations clearly nullify the claim that consumption of SDDs could alter the sex of the growing foetus 
An analysis done by the same authors earlier revealed that SSDs contain testosterone and steroids 
 
  The prenatal testosterone in pregnancy is known to affect sexual development adversely      The principles of reproductive biology state that the genetic sex of an individual is determined at the time of conception and can never be altered under any circumstances 
However  phenotypic sex of the growing foetus is likely to be influenced by the hormonal milieu of in utero environment 
Our analysis was confined to phenotypic sex only and hence it is difficult to state if any differences existed with reference to genetic and phenotypic sex 
This requires further inquiry Evidence on the effects of SSDs on humans should best be obtained from human beings 
The findings of the current study corroborate well with the evidence generated from observational studies in human beings      Presence of skeletal and visceral malformations could explain why stillbirths are likely to be more in women who consume SSDs 
The dosing of the test drugs was intended not only to examine the period of organogenesis solely but to assess effects from preimplantation  through the entire period of gestation to the day before caesarean section 
The results were based on observations of more than   female animals with implantation sites at necropsy that added to its strength 
Unnecessary handling of pregnant animals as well as any stressors from outside was avoided 
At least three dose levels and a concurrent vehicle control were used with dams randomly allocated to different treatment groups that support the validity of the results 
However  absence of   rats per group does not support it to be a fully OECD compliant study 
We did follow the principles of Good Laboratory Practices  GLP  but due to constraints of resources the study could not be conducted as a GLP compliant study  though this is optimal for academic interests There is a lack of systematic approach to assess the safety and effectiveness of herbal preparations 
Ingredients for herbal medicines are often drawn from different sources and are used in combination  which may exhibit variability in terms of species  growing conditions  and biologically active constituents 
To isolate each active ingredient from each herb and then to establish its toxicity is time consuming  resource intensive and not practical 
Moreover  drug approval process does not accommodate undifferentiated mixtures  Though important  it surpasses the herb herb interaction and the potentiating effect of one compound over another 
Therefore  in our study  we administered the herbal mixture to assess the effects 
Real time evaluations have yielded important observations for several herbal drugs especially related to pregnancy 
For instance  Wang et al 
  used mice model to evaluate the adverse pregnancy outcomes after maternal exposure to the herbal medicines  particularly during early pregnancy  The major events included maternal and perinatal mortality 
Maternal weight gain  embryo growth and post natal weight gain were significantly decreased 
Moreover  foetal resorption and skeletal malformations were increased  signifying potential toxicity of Chinese herbal medicines 
This is comparable to our findings To conclude  the results of this developmental toxicity study suggest that administration of SSD  and SSD  to pregnant rats exerted significant impact on intrauterine foetal growth and development without any effect on sex ratio when administered during the period of organogenesis 
The prenatal exposure of SSD  and SSD  at dosage level of   mg kg day and   mg kg day during gestational days  –  to female rats had demonstrable effect on maternal or embryo foetal toxicity and teratogenicity SBN and AG conceptualized the study  AS and DD developed the study protocol and conducted the experiment  analysed the data and interpreted the findings

It is therefore natural to expect that the distribution of amino acids  across all protein sequences  would appear to be fixed  given no mutations over a specific period of time 
Of the   naturally occurring amino acids  each seems to appear randomly located at a particular position within the sequence of a protein 
However  when the sequences of a group of proteins are compared to one another  specific patterns begin to emerge 
These patterns are commonly referred to as motifs and frequently produce similar structural elements and in many cases  similar functions between the proteins that contain them 
In recent years  significant efforts have been made to reduce sequences into discrete motifs  so that each can be linked to some specific biological function based on particular rules      
Databases that consist of identifiable amino acid motifs  such as PROSITE  Pratt and EMOTIF  have been constructed to allow researchers an easy classification of unknown proteins into families based on their common motifs               
All of these methods share one property  they depend on specific alignment algorithms  such as the basic local alignment search tool  BLAST or PSI BLAST  to perform the sequence comparison between diverse families of proteins being analyzed      
These methods have already led to a number of key discoveries and offer the promise of determining biologically meaningful information about function from a protein s primary sequence It is generally accepted that a strong correlation exists between a protein s amino acid sequence and its resulting structure and function         
Techniques that can quickly determine significant similarities between protein sequences are valuable in predicting an unknown protein s function within the cell 
Here we describe a procedure that  by computing the frequency of key amino acid pairs  can quickly classify large groups of proteins into functional groups 
In order to uncover any relevant amino acid strings  we have utilized statistical methods applicable to datasets with large fluctuations in the search of human protein sequences within both the Swiss Prot and Complete Human Genebank databases The goal of this manuscript is to demonstrate how these two residue motifs can be used to develop rapid methods for searching protein or genomic databases in order to locate potentially interesting or aberrant protein sequences 
As an example  we describe the distribution of select amino acid pairs within the genome of the Coronavirus  Tor  which is responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome  SARS    
We have examined additional sets  but the limited format of this paper precludes a large presentation of potential applications The set of all   naturally occurring  amino acids are described by their standard single letter representations  and are taken as the complete set contained within all protein sequences as shown below Zq A R N D C Q E G H I L K M F P S T W Y V Residues that are arranged in a certain order can be referred to as vectors and are represented symbolically as b n b b bn bj Zq The coordinates of each vector represent the amino acid symbols contained within any given protein  where n is the total length of the vector 
The collection of all vectors b n  in the proteome can therefore be denoted simply by Zq n The underlying structure of a protein sequence  which is the order of the amino acids  has unique and identifiable characteristics 
As an analogy  in written English  the letter q is almost always followed by u 
Also  the frequency of the word  and  is much higher than that of the related three letter strings   nad   nda   dan  and  dna  which are simply permutations of the same set of individual letters to construct a word with a different meaning 
Utilizing similar characteristics  we can intuitively scan for unique sequence vectors contained within any given protein 
We expand on these characteristics  by utilizing the concepts of affinity and order stability in Section  Using the entire Swiss Prot database  release number   as the basis for our calculations  we have constructed a probability table for the occurrence of the   naturally occurring amino acids  see Table  
    
In addition to the Swiss Prot database  we have also included data from Complete Human Genebank  NCBI Build Number   March    as a source for all characterized and hypothetical human protein sequences We use the symbol Ω to denote the Swiss Prot database  and the letter M to denote the number of proteins in the database  
Hence we can state that Ω As s M  where As a a as Ns  is the sth protein  ai with i Zq is the ith amino acid in the sequence  and Ns is the length of the protein sequence As 
For any vector b n  if there is a sequence As in Ω such that b n  is a segment of As  then we can say b n  occurs in Ω 
We can then use NΩ b n  to denote the total number of outcomes that b n  has occurred in Ω  and let NΩ n  be the total number of all vectors occurring in Ω with length n  Therefore p b n NΩ b n NΩ n is the probability that the vector b n  occurs in Ω 
We then introduce k p q b n log p b n q b n where p b n  and q b n  are any two probability distributions on Zq n  and b n  belongs to Zq n 
The quantity k p q b n  in Eq 
  is defined for any two probability distributions p b n  and q b n  on Zq n  where the distribution q arises from independent letter  i e  amino acid  probabilities 
Then  k p q b n  can be viewed as a random variable about b n  and its probability distribution is defined as follows F p q x PI k p q b n ⩽x b n k p q b n ⩽xp b n The expectation value μ p q  and variance σ p q  of p b n  are expressed mathematically as μ p q b n Zq n p b n k p q b n 
 σ p q b n Zq n p b n k p q b n μ p q  Hence we see that μ p q  is simply the Kullback–Leibler entropy   
As a consequence  μ p q  is always non negative and μ p q  if and only if p b n q b n 
As a result  the amino acid sequence of b n  can be represented by k p q b n In Eq 
  the probability distributions p  q in the k p q b n  have several possible values 
For example  if we let p be the probability of b n  and only change the value of q in k p q b n  we obtain the following expression q b n j np bj p b p b p bn Based on Eqs 
  and   the value of k p q b n  gives us the affinity for all amino acids within vector b n 
Here two situations are identified as especially interesting i When k p q b n  implies that among the amino acids in vector b n  there is an increased affinity 
That is  the vector b n  occurs more frequently than expected 
 ii When k p q b n  implies that among the amino acids in vector b n  there is a decreased affinity 
That is  the vector b n  occurs less frequently than expected In a similar approach to the condition described above  we may choose q b n p πn b n  where πn b n  is a permutation of b n  and πn denotes a permutation transform 
In this case  the order sensitivity of b n  can also be reflected by the value of k p q b n  and produces the following outcomes i when k p q b n  implies that b n  occurs much more often than πn b n ii when k p q b n  implies that πn b n  occurs much more often than b n In addition to the concepts of affinity and order sensitivity  we can also design other analysis techniques by choosing alternate representations of q b n 
Quantifying the terms k p q b n  we can represent vector frequency numerically 
In cases where k p q b n μ p q ⩾ σ p q  the corresponding vector b n  is called  positive  while in those cases where the opposite takes place  k p q b n μ p q ⩽ σ p q  the vector b n  is called  negative 
By judiciously choosing a   equal to   we obtained   two residue  positive pairs  and   two residue negative pairs  see Table  
  out of a total of   possibilities of amino acid pairs Using any one of the positive motifs from Table   we can develop a test method to detect changes in their distribution through any protein database 
If b b b  is  positive  then p b b μ σp b p b  where p ⋅  is the probability of the amino acids or vectors ⋅ in the database 
Since NΩ μ M Nμ p bj NΩ bj μ MNμ we have NΩ b μ M Nμ μ MNμ μ σp b NΩ b or NΩ b μ M Nμ μ MNμ μ σp b NΩ b and since μ M Nμ is very close to μ MNμfor Swiss Prot database we have NΩ b μ σp b NΩ b and NΩ b μ σp b NΩ b As a consequence of Eq 
  the detection of a deleterious mutation based on the increased appearance of an arbitrary string of these residues becomes possible 
For example  according to Table   CC is an attractive motif with   then NΩ CC μ σp C μ M Nμ μ MNμNΩ C ≈ μ σp C NΩ C Let Ns CC  and Ns C  be the number of CC and the number of C in the sth protein 
Then we have NΩ CC NΩ C  because μ σ  and p C  since NΩ CC s MNs CC NΩ C s MNs C Based upon the result that the CC pair represents a rare event  proteins satisfying Ns CC Ns C  as defined in Eq 
  suddenly become interesting 
We can therefore consider the number Ns CC  as an index to develop detection methods to test for the presence of a CC containing protein within a database 
Using this same reasoning  one can also use any other one of the remaining motifs in Table   to develop detection methods for additional proteins In an identical fashion to the previous example using the positive two residue motifs in Table   we can also use any of the  negative  two residue motifs to develop search methods 
For example  the CM pair is a  negative  two residue  word  with  
That is  p CM μ σp C p M 
Using identical arguments to those described in Section   we obtain NΩ CM NΩ M  and NΩ CM NΩ C 
Since both Ns M  and Ns C  are small numbers for fixed proteins  the overall number of CM pairs in most proteins should be close to zero 
Therefore  we can also use any of the remaining seven  negative  motifs in Table   to develop additional detection methods In contrast to the CC motif  the total number of proteins in the Swiss Prot database having more than one CM pair is quite small 
For example  among the   proteins contained within this database  the number of proteins such that Ns CM ⩾  is   and the number of proteins satisfying the condition Ns CM ⩾  is only  
For human proteins in Swiss Prot  the total number of proteins containing CM pairs is   and there are only   proteins that satisfy Ns CM ⩾   Table  
However  we would expect to find about   proteins having CM pairs in the Swiss Prot database  based upon the amino acid frequencies given in Table   which is greater than the number observed Cysteine rich proteins and the presence of CC pairs in proteins are both concepts that have been studied previously      
If we combine these two concepts and describe them in mathematical terms  we observe that the rates q Ns C Ns and q Ns CC Ns C  describe these two conditions  where Ns  Ns C  and Ns CC  are the numbers of all amino acids  cysteine  and CC  respectively 
We can then derive proteinsNs C Ns p C σ Ns CC Ns C p ξτ C ξτ C σ where σ  and σ  are the standard deviations about Ns C Nss Mand Ns CC Ns C s M respectively We have found the following computational results based on Swiss Prot database σ ≈ σ ≈ andp ξτ C ξτ C ⩾ p C For   we have a much simpler method to determine that a protein sequence is both C  and CC rich if proteinsNs C Ns ∩proteinsNs CC Ns C So  a much simpler method to test whether a protein is a both C  and CC rich for   isNumber of CC  Number of C Number of C  Length of protein Using this principle  we found a total of eight proteins that are both C  and CC rich within the Swiss Prot database For   there is an easier method to determine whether a protein sequence is both C  and CC rich if proteinsNs C Ns ∩proteinsNs CC Ns C So  a much simpler method to test whether a protein is both C  and CC rich for   is based on the inequalitiesNumber of CC  Number of C Number of C  Length of protein Using this principle  we can get a total of   proteins that are both C  and CC rich within the entire Swiss Prot database For   there is also an easier method to determine if a protein sequence is both C  and CC rich sequence when proteinsNs C Ns ∩proteinsNs CC Ns C So  a much simpler method to test whether a protein is both C  and CC rich for   is based on the inequalitiesNumber of CC  Number of C Number of C Length of protein Using this principle  we have identified a total of   proteins that are both C  and CC rich within the Swiss Prot database 
From these results  it becomes clear that there are many C rich proteins and many CC rich proteins that are not mutually inclusive 
The sets of both C  and CC rich proteins are only subsets of the set containing all C rich proteins or that containing all CC rich proteins Because the Swiss Prot database is somewhat biased to those proteins that are of interest to researchers  we have decided to examine a database that was  in essence  complete 
For this  we chose the human subset sequences contained within the Complete Human Genebank database 
This was the most complete and readily available source of human genetic sequences and should therefore provide us with an accurate representation of both CC and CM pair distributions 
We observed that the total number of CC pairs within the human subset of sequences contained in Genebank  a total of   proteins  was  
These pairs were contained within a total of   proteins  Table   a number that is substantially larger than the   we obtained from Swiss Prot data  Table  
Since the total number of amino acids in The Complete Human Genebank is   we can easily get the expected number of CC in Complete Human Genebank is   which is much less than this actual value  
The same also holds true for the CM pair  where we would expect to see   CM pairs  but actually observe    Table  
 
This result is surprising but true and shows that there are fundamental difference between the Human and other species in terms of the frequency of CC and CM pairs To create a single CM pair  it is obvious that one needs only a single C  If a protein sequence also contains a CC pair  the total number of cysteines available to create a CM pair has been reduced by a factor of  
Using the cutoff value of four CC pairs as statistically significant  we determined the probability of finding a CM pair within proteins that already contained a CC pair  Table  
Even though both CC and CM can occur in the same protein  the total number of proteins in Genebank that contain both CC and CM pairs is   and these pairs almost always occur at different locations in the sequence 
However  in some rare cases the second C within the CC pair is shared with the first C within the CM pair  giving us a new triplet CCM If we filter the set of proteins described above for redundant entries  we obtain a set of   unique proteins that contain the CCM triplet in the human proteome 
Using the probability distributions obtained from Swiss Prot  we obtained the probability of CCM as  
Since the total of all protein lengths in the Swiss Prot database is   there should be a total of   CCM triplets 
This value is almost identical to the predicted number of CCM of  
This result suggests that the CCM triplet at least in Swiss Prot occurs randomly 
However  we can also analyze the CCM probability using a different approach  putting q CCM p CC p M  into Eq 
 
If CCM occurs randomly  then we have p CCM p C p C p M  and since p CC μ σp C p C  we will get k p q CCM log p CCM q CCM log p C p CC ⩽ μ σ Based on Eq 
  it is clear that the presence of a CC pair strongly excludes M  Therefore  the probability of the CCM triplet should occur less frequently than that of CC or M individually We have obtained the following statistical results with regard to the total number of CC and CM pairs contained in the Swiss Prot database i The total number of these proteins satisfying Ns CC ⩾  is   and   of these are found in humans 
 ii The total number of human proteins in Ω that satisfy Ns CC ⩾  is  
 iii The total number of the proteins in Ω that satisfy Ns CM ⩾  is     of these are found in humans 
 iv The total number of human proteins in Ω that satisfy Ns CM ⩾  is only  
The genome of the SARS associated Coronavirus contains a total of   open reading frames  which code for six characterized and five uncharacterized proteins   
After examining the complete proteome the SARS associated Coronavirus we observed a statistically significant increase in the occurrence of the CC and CM pairs in the SARS associated Coronavirus  genome Of the   putative proteins  four contain either CC or CM pairs 
Two large poly proteins  GI  and GI  contain   CC and   CM pairs  as well as   CC and   CM pairs  respectively 
The putative spike glycoprotein  GI    contains   CC and   CM  while the small envelope protein  GI    contains only   CC pair 
The remaining   proteins  of which two have been identified as a nucleocapsid and matrix protein  contain no CC or CM pairs 
When compared to the occurrence of CC and CM pairs within all human proteins found in the Swiss Prot database  it becomes clear that there is an increased occurrence of these pairs within the SARS associated Coronavirus proteome It is clear that the frequency of CC and CM pairs is significantly higher in the SARS genome than it is in the human genome 
It is our hope that these unique two residue motifs could be used as a means of identifying a virus such as SARS 
While currently impossible to determine  one can see a possible clinical use for determining the frequency of CC or CM pairs in an individual 
If a person has been infected by SARS  we would expect the numbers of CC and CM pairs to be much higher than in a healthy individual 
If we were then able to develop a clinically feasible technique that could identify the CC or CM pair content in total cellular protein  without damaging the cell  it could be possible to implement a detection method simply by counting the numbers of CC or CM pairs in all proteins examined 
If the presence of increased CC or CM pairs was indicative of infection by SARS we could develop new drugs to inhibit the translation of proteins that contain these pairs within infected cells 
As a very specific example  this could be accomplished through the use of specific tRNA mimics that could block translating ribosome when these pairs appear at the P and A site simultaneously      
While tRNA mimics could normally be seen as non specific protein synthesis inhibitors  the lower frequency of the CC or CM motifs in host proteins as compared to the relatively high occurrence in viral protein provide a starting point for the analysis of treatments using methods such as these In this paper we have performed a detailed search of the Swiss Prot and Complete Human Genebank database in relation to the frequencies of each of the   natural amino acids and motifs made up of two residues 
This has provided us with a new insight into the distribution of proteins within these databases and the information that may be contained within a protein s primary amino acid sequence 
Our focus in this quest has been to examine specific pairs or triplets of residues and use probability theory to assess whether or not particular strings of residues occur more frequently than their probability would indicate 
By analyzing affinity and anti affinity  we developed a procedure to search out all two  and three residue clusters within these databases 
Through this technique  we can rapidly classify large groups of proteins into families based on the occurrence of these motifs 
Combining this concept with a specific knowledge of protein function  we propose novel ideas aimed at developing fast detection methods for specific diseases based on the unusually high occurrence of some of these motifs when compared with the expected probabilities 
A timely example of the application of this method is given  namely the analysis of the SARS virus 
This method will hopefully lead to the discovery of new diagnostic techniques and possible treatment of diseases  by recognizing the location of target domains in the expressed sequence Cell type specific expression of the putative SARS CoV  receptor ACE  in human heartsThe coronavirus disease    COVID  caused by SARS CoV  infections imposes a major threat for the world s healthcare systems and is leading to thousands of deaths 
Angiotensin converting enzyme    ACE  has been identified as a potential receptor for SARS coronavirus  and is also considered the main receptor for SARS CoV  SARS CoV  binds to ACE  via its glycosylated outer membrane spike proteins 
ACE  is highly expressed in the lung and heart  and is known for its vital role in the cardiovascular system –  Although SARS CoV  mainly invades alveolar epithelial cells  it can also cause myocardial injury  as assessed by increased troponin T and NT proBNP levels accompanying increased cardiovascular symptoms in COVID infected patients  It is unclear whether elevated biomarkers of cardiac injury  or long term effects on the cardiovascular system  are directly caused by viral infection of cardiac tissue or are secondary to hypoxia and systemic inflammation 
However  patients with underlying cardiovascular disease represent a significant proportion of the patients who may suffer from a severe course after COVID  infection  This situation may be aggravated by findings showing that ACE inhibitors  which are often used to treat cardiovascular diseases  augment the expression of the SARS CoV  receptor ACE  in lung cells  This is probably mediated by an effect on angiotensin II  which is known to reduce ACE  expression  Thus  ACE inhibition decreases angiotensin II  leading to an indirect up regulation of ACE  The effect of angiotensin II receptor blockers  ARBs  which primarily target the angiotensin receptor   is unclear 
One may speculate that ARBs indirectly reduce ACE  levels by augmenting free angiotensin II levels  which in turn is expected to down regulate ACE  via activating the angiotensin receptor  
However  the effect of the two different treatments on the expression of ACE  in the heart requires further investigation Therefore  we used single nuclei RNA sequencing to determine the expression of ACE and ACE  in the different cell types of the human heart 
Gene expression signatures were detected in cardiac tissues of five patients with aortic stenosis  AS  and two patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction  HFrEF   Figure  A  and compared with with samples of one healthy donor heart  age    years  male  that was not used for transplantation 
After single nuclei RNA sequencing  data were pooled  and unsupervised clustering was performed with a total of     nuclei 
We found   distinct clusters 
Using cell type specific gene markers  major cell types were annotated  including cardiomyocytes  six clusters  fibroblasts  one cluster  endothelial cells  three clusters  leucocytes  two clusters  pericytes  one cluster  and smooth muscle cells  one cluster   Figure  B–D 
ACE  was expressed in cardiomyocytes  Cluster   and   and mural cells  particularly pericytes  Cluster   and was detected at a lower expression level in fibroblasts  endothelial cell  and leucocytes  Figure  D 
Comparison of ACE  in a pooled analysis of nuclei of the different groups showed that ACE  was significantly elevated in cardiomyocytes of patients with heart disease compared with healthy controls  Figure  E 
ACE  was also slightly  but not significantly  increased in endothelial cells  and the expression was lower in fibroblasts of patients with heart disease compared with healthy controls  Figure  E 
Immunostaining confirmed an increased expression of ACE  in cardiomyocytes of patients with aortic stenosis  Figure  F 
In addition  ACE was augmented in cardiomyocytes of patients with AS and HFrEF  Figure  G 
Interestingly  cardiomyocytes of patients who were treated with ACE inhibitors showed a significantly higher ACE  expression compared with ARB treated patients  Figure  H 
Moreover  patients treated with ACE inhibitors had an imbalance of ACE to ACE  expression  with a more than four fold higher ACE ACE  ratio compared with healthy control cells  Figure  I In conclusion  these data provide novel insights into the cell type specific expression and regulation of ACE  in the heart 
Patients with varying heart disease aetiology show augmented expression of ACE  levels particularly in cardiomyocytes 
Treatment with ACE inhibitors tends to be associated with increased ACE  mRNA and unfavourable ACE ACE  ratios  which are believed to be a driver of cardiovascular pathologies  This study is limited by its small sample size and therefore is only hypothesis generating 
However  these novel data suggest that it will be important to monitor SARS CoV infected patients for cardiovascular complications and assess the impact of ARB ACE inhibitor therapy 
Conflict of interest  none declared New onset acute symptomatic seizure and risk factors in coronavirus disease   A retrospective multicenter studyIn December   pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus  later called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus    SARS‐CoV‐  was first reported in Wuhan  China 
On March     the World Health Organization  WHO  declared the syndrome caused by SARS‐CoV‐  infection  coronavirus disease    COVID‐  a pandemic 
According to a WHO Situation Report of April    
 
 there are   confirmed COVID‐  cases and   deaths globally 
COVID‐  affects people of all ages 
 
  
 
 and in severe cases  it may cause dyspnea  hypoxia  acute respiratory distress syndrome  and septic shock 
 
  
 

The current situation has raised concerns regarding whether people with epilepsy have a higher risk to be infected with COVID‐  and whether people would develop acute seizures during the course of COVID‐ 
The objective of this study is to clarify the incidence and the risk of acute symptomatic seizures during acute COVID‐  infections This retrospective multicenter study was approved by the ethics committee of West China Hospital  Sichuan University  approval   
The study was conducted in   officially designed hospitals in Hubei province  the epicenter of the COVID‐  epidemic in China  Sichuan province  and Chongqing municipality 
These hospitals included the East Branch of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University  West China Ward  Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital  and hospitals in Sichuan province designated by the government to treat COVID‐   see the list of hospitals in Appendix S People with COVID‐  who were discharged from or died in the participating hospitals between January   and February     were consecutively enrolled 
All cases were diagnosed according to the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for COVID‐   trial version  
 
 All those enrolled tested positive through nucleic acid detection 
Disease severity was classified as mild  moderate  severe  or critical according to the national guidelines  see Box   for classification criteria 
 
 For our study  we aggregated severe and critical cases into a single severe group  whereas mild and moderate cases were aggregated into a single milder group 
The clinical outcome at discharge was either cured or death Electronic medical records of all enrolled cases were reviewed by   neurologists using a standard case report form  Appendix S 
Data were extracted on demographic characteristics  medical history  complications  treatments  and presence of risk factors for seizures 
These risk factors were considered to be the following  acute cerebrovascular disease  traumatic brain injury  TBI  central nervous system  CNS  infection  shock  hypoxia  severe metabolic disturbance  based on criteria from the International League Against Epilepsy
 
  multiple‐organ dysfunction syndrome  sepsis  and exposure to drugs or toxic substances Continuous variables were presented as median  interquartile range  and categorical variables as n  All of   people discharged from or who died at participating hospitals were consecutively identified and enrolled 
Most were from Sichuan province  n     followed by Chongqing  n     and Hubei  n    Ten individuals died  giving case fatality rates of    n     in Hubei     n     in Chongqing  and    n     in Sichuan 
Of the   severe cases      received mechanical ventilation  and     were given sedatives 
Apart from the effect of sedatives  mental state was relatively normal in   people 
Eight were encephalopathic  one was obtunded  one was delirious  and six were comatose 
The diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus was not made in any of these cases based on clinical presentation  results of investigations  or response to therapy 
No routine or long‐term electroencephalogram  EEG  was recorded due to exposure concerns None in this cohort had a past history of epilepsy 
None had any seizures  including febrile seizures  or status epilepticus during hospitalization 
Seizurelike events were seen in two people  it was believed that this was the result of an acute stress reaction in one and hypocalcemia in the other The first was a  ‐year‐old woman who reported bilateral bodily spasms lasting for about   minute  with mouth deviation but no impairment of awareness 
She was evaluated neurologically and psychiatrically and was diagnosed with an acute anxiety disorder  which was treated with olanzapine  paroxetine  and diazepam The second case was a  ‐year‐old woman who displayed bilateral myoclonus in the limbs with no impairment in consciousness   hours after admission 
Although this was initially suspected to represent seizures  she was found to have an electrolyte disturbance including hyponatremia  hypokalemia  and hypocalcemia  and the myoclonus resolved with correction of the metabolic disturbances Eighty‐four   cases reported systemic or direct brain insults that increased their risk for acute symptomatic seizures  Table  
The most common risk factor was hypoxia 
No severe electrolyte disturbance was seen  but hypokalemia  n       hyponatremia  n       and hypocalcemia  n       were frequently seen in the cohort 
Urea  creatinine  and serum glucose levels were moderately altered in most of cases 
In two cases who had chronic kidney dysfunction  substantial increases in creatinine levels were noted 
Results of investigations are shown in Table  
One case with TBI had an epidural hematoma  cerebral contusion  and skull base fracture 
Five people with severe COVID‐  experienced septic shock 
Three other cases of shock had hypovolemia or cardiac problems 
Ninety‐four   were given antibiotics  moxifloxacin  n       piperacillin sulbactam sodium  n       and third‐generation cephalosporins  n       were most commonly used We found no new onset seizures or status epilepticus in a large cohort of people hospitalized during the acute phase of COVID   infection despite a substantial proportion having risk factors for acute symptomatic seizures 
This is useful information  given the prior lack of knowledge about seizure risk during the acute phase of infection No individual in this cohort had a history of epilepsy prior to hospital admission 
To date  there is not much information available on people with epilepsy during the COVID‐  crisis 
There is one report of epilepsy in a case COVID‐  from Wuhan 
 
 As information is limited  it is not possible to establish whether this was a patient who had a history of epilepsy or whether the patient presented acute seizures 
There is at this time little if any evidence indicating that people with epilepsy are at an increased risk of COVID‐  infection 
A major challenge for people with epilepsy in this outbreak is nonadherence with the prescribed antiseizure medication  which was seen during the in SARS endemic in  
 
 This indicates the need to ensure the availability of supplies of medications and to advocate patients  self‐management 
Possible strategies for coping could also include online consultations and telemedicine networks Although many neurological and systemic disorders regarded as potential triggers
 
 of acute symptomatic seizures were identified in this cohort  seizures and status were not seen 
Stroke is one such risk factor 
The risk of developing acute symptomatic seizures after stroke ranges from   to  
 
 Acute cerebrovascular disease is considered a major cause of seizure and status epilepticus 
An earlier study from Hubei
 
  
 
 also reported six people with COVID‐  who had acute cerebrovascular disease without seizure 
Infection of the CNS can also give rise to seizures 
Although there is limited evidence of the presence of the SARS‐CoV‐  in the cerebrospinal fluid  CSF  the co‐occurrence of tubercular meningitis
 
 had been reported  with no seizure or status observed 
To determine whether COVID‐  can cause direct CNS insults requires further follow‐up 
In the earlier outbreaks of another coronavirus  a generalized convulsion with a positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for SARS‐CoV in CSF was reported  which could have been a coincidence 
 

Disturbances of homeostasis may lead to acute symptomatic seizures 
Hypoxia  the most common complication in our cohort  may trigger anoxic encephalopathy  particularly in refractory hypoxia 
Electrolyte disturbances as seen in COVID‐  are considered to be potential causes of acute symptomatic seizure 
 
 The severity and speed of such disturbances may affect onset of seizures  so these parameters should be carefully monitored The cytokine storm syndromes
 
 behind severe infection may cause the production of inflammatory cytokines systemically  with the consequence of acute toxic encephalopathies 
Although sepsis is a common cause of encephalopathy in intensive care medicine 
 
 hypoxia appears far more often than sepsis in COVID‐ 
There was also a high rate of septic shock in the COVID‐  population  varying from  
 
 to   in earlier studies in Hubei 
 
  
 

Certain antibiotics have been associated with symptomatic seizure 
 
 Antibiotics were used in a large number of people in our cohort without problems  but the most used antibiotics in the cohort were of low or moderate risk 
Clinicians should keep this seizure risk in mind when prescribing antibiotics  especially for people with renal dysfunction 
 

Our study has several limitations 
First  as a cross‐sectional study  we only have data from the acute phase of the disease 
A follow‐up study is underway to evaluate longitudinal seizure outcomes 
Second  the retrospective study design meant that we could not collect data on all relevant variables  for example  EEG was not recorded  so subclinical seizures could have been missed 
As all health care costs of COVID‐  treatment are covered by the government  all those suspected of infection are screened 
This may assure the objectivity and reliability of study materials  and it will allow for a future follow‐up study Our analysis suggests that COVID‐  poses minimal risk for seizures during the acute illness  although a significant proportion of severely ill individuals have risk factors that may increase the propensity to experience seizures 
These risk factors should be promptly addressed to minimize the risk of developing seizures 
Prospective long‐term studies must be done to determine whether people who have suffered from COVID‐  have an increased risk for developing seizures or epilepsy in subsequent months or years as a consequence of their illness None of the authors has any conflict of interest to disclose 
We confirm that we have read the Journal s position on issues involved in ethical publication and affirm that this report is consistent with those guidelines Recombination Every Day  Abundant Recombination in a Virus during a Single Multi Cellular Host InfectionAs increasing numbers of full length viral sequences become available  recombinant or mosaic viruses are being recognized more frequently   
Recombination events have been demonstrated to be associated with viruses expanding their host range   or increasing their virulence    thus accompanying  or perhaps even being at the origin of  major changes during virus adaptation 
It remains unclear  however  whether recombination events represent a highly frequent and significant phenomenon in the everyday life of these viruses Viruses can exchange genetic material when at least two different viral genomes co infect the same host cell 
Progeny can then become hybrid through different mechanisms  such as reassortment of segments when the parental genomes are fragmented    intra molecular recombination when polymerases switch templates  in RNA viruses     or homologous or non homologous recombination  in both RNA and DNA viruses 
Quantification of viral recombination in multi cellular organisms has been attempted under two distinct experimental approaches  in vitro  in cell cultures     and in vivo  in live hosts    
The in vitro approach  which has so far been applied only to animal viruses  allows the establishment of the  intrinsic  recombination rate in experimentally co infected cells in cell cultures   
However  it does not necessarily reflect the situation in entire  living hosts  where the frequency of co infected cells is poorly known and depends on many factors such as the size of the pathogen population  the relative frequency and distribution of the different variants  and host defense mechanisms preventing secondary infection of cells 
The in vivo experimental approach is closer to biological conditions and may thus be more informative of what actually happens in  the real world However  as discussed below  numerous experimental constraints have so far precluded an actual quantification of the baseline rate of recombination 
First  many experimental designs have used extreme positive selection  where only recombinant genomes were viable  e g    
Other studies did not use complementation techniques but detected recombinants by PCR within infected hosts or tissues    which provides information on their presence but not on their frequency in the viral population 
So far  no quantitative PCR or other quantitative method has been applied to evaluate the number of recombinants appearing in an experimentally infected live host 
Finally  recent methods based on sequence analysis inferred the population recombination rate  rather than the individual recombination rate   
While results from these methods certainly take in vivo recombination into account  there are other caveats  isolates have often been collected in different hosts sometimes in different geographical regions and sometimes the selective neutrality of sequence variation on which these estimates are based is not clearly established 
Estimates from such studies by essence address the estimation of the recombination rate at a different evolutionary scale Taken together  the currently available information indicates that no viral recombination rate has ever been estimated directly at time and space scales corresponding to a single multi cellular host infection  although this level is most significant for the biology and evolution of viruses 
This study intends to fill this gap by evaluating the recombination frequency of the cauliflower mosaic virus  CaMV  during a single passage in one of its host plants  the turnip Brassica rapa CaMV is a pararetrovirus  which is a major grouping containing hepadnaviruses  e g  hepatitis B virus  badnaviruses  e g  banana streak virus  and caulimoviruses  e g  CaMV 
Pararetroviruses are characterized by a non segmented double stranded DNA genome 
After entering the host cell nucleus  the viral DNA accumulates as a minichromosome   whose transcription is ensured by the host RNA polymerase II   
The CaMV genome consists in approximately   bp and encodes six viral gene products that have been detected in planta  Figure     
Viral proteins P  to P  are expressed from two major transcripts  namely a  S RNA  encoding P  and a  S RNA corresponding to the entire genome and serving as mRNA for proteins P –P    
Using the pre genomic  S RNA as a matrix  the protein P   product of gene V  reverse transcribes the genome into genomic DNA that is concomitantly encapsidated   The detection of CaMV recombinants in turnip hosts has been reported numerous times 
Some studies have demonstrated the appearance of infectious recombinant viral genomes after inoculation  i  of a host plant with two infectious or non infectious parental clones   or  ii  of a transgenic plant containing one CaMV transgene with a CaMV genome missing the corresponding genomic region   
While the former revealed inter genomic viral recombination  the latter demonstrated that CaMV can also recombine with transgenes within the host s genome 
Another study based on phylogenetic analyses of various CaMV strains has clearly suggested different origins for different genomic regions and  hence  multiple recombination events during the evolution of this virus   
Indirect experimental evidence has indicated that  in some cases  CaMV recombination could occur within the host nucleus  between different viral minichromosomes  presumably through the action of the DNA repair cellular machinery   
Nevertheless  the mechanism of  template switching  during reverse transcription  predominant in all retroviruses  most certainly also applies to pararetroviruses 
For this reason  and on the basis of numerous experimental data  CaMV is generally believed to recombine mostly in the cytoplasm of the host cell  by  legal  template switching between two pre genomic RNA molecules    or  illegal  template switching between the  S and the  S RNA   
Under this hypothesis  recombination in CaMV could therefore be considered as operating on a linear template during reverse transcription  with the  ′ and  ′ extremities later ligated to circularize the genomic DNA  position   in Figure  
The above cited studies clearly demonstrate that CaMV is able to recombine 
However  since these studies are based on complementation techniques  non quantitative detection  or phylogenetically based inferences of recombination  they do not inform us on whether recombination is an exceptional event or an  everyday  process shaping the genetic composition of CaMV populations In the present work  we aimed at answering this question 
To this end  we have constructed a CaMV genome with four genetic markers  demonstrated to be neutral in competition experiments 
By co inoculating host plants with equal amounts of wild type and marker containing CaMV particles  we have generated mixed populations in which impressive proportions of recombinants distributed in several different classes corresponding to exchange of different genomic regions have been detected and quantified 
Altogether  the recombinant genomes averaged over   of the population 
Further analysis of these data  assuming a number of viral replications during the infection period ranging from five to   indicates that the per nucleotide per replication cycle recombination rate of CaMV is of the same order of magnitude  i e  on the order of a few   across the entire genome 
We thereby provide the first quantification  to our knowledge  of the recombination rate in a virus population during a single passage in a single host From Figure   and supposing that all marker containing genomic regions can recombine  we could predict the detection and quantification of seven classes of recombinant genotypes   bcd a  a cd b  ab d c  abc d   cd ab  a d bc  and a c b d 
Indeed  all classes were detected  and their frequencies in the ten CaMV populations analyzed are summarized in Table  Altogether  the proportion of recombinant genomes found in the mixed viral populations was astonishingly high and very similar in the ten co infected plants analyzed  Table   last column  ranging between    plant   to    plants     and   with a mean frequency   standard error  of      
This result indicates that recombination events are very frequent during the invasion of the host plant by CaMV and represents  to our knowledge  the first direct quantification of viral recombination during the infection of a live multi cellular host The inferred per generation recombination and interference rates  assuming that CaMV undergoes ten replication cycles during the   d between infection and sampling  are given for each of the ten plants in Table  
Recombination rates between adjacent markers are large  on the order of   to  
Taking the distance in nucleotides between markers into account yields an average recombination rate per nucleotide and generation on the order of      
Interestingly  this recombination rate does not vary throughout the genome  Kruskal–Wallis test  p    To relax the assumption of the number of replications during the   d  we calculated the recombination parameters assuming five or   generations 
The effect of the number of generations on the estimates is linear  doubling the number of generations results in a halving of the recombination rate  detailed results not shown 
For example  the average recombination rates r
  r
  and r
  assuming   generations were equal to     and   respectively  compare with values in Table   yielding per nucleotide per generation recombination rates of             and      Inspection of Table   also shows that first order interference coefficients were in general negative  indicating that a crossing over in one genomic segment increases the probability that a crossing over will occur in another genomic segment  while the second order coefficient parameter had an average value close to zero with a large variance 
The mechanism leading to these results will be discussed in the following section One major breakthrough in the work presented here lies in the space and time scales at which the experiments were performed 
Indeed  the processes occurring within the course of a single infection of one multi cellular host are of obvious biological relevance for any disease 
Previous studies on viral recombination suffered from major drawbacks in this respect  basing their conclusions on experiments relying on complementation among non infectious viruses or between viruses with undetermined relative fitness  on phylogenetically based analyses  or on experiments in cell cultures 
For reasons detailed in the Introduction  the first two methods either do not provide information on the frequency of recombination  but only its occurrence  or address the question at a different temporal  and often spatial  scale 
Results from cell cultures  on the other hand  impose cell co infection by different viral variants  potentially overestimating the frequency of recombination events 
Our study circumvents these limitations by analyzing viral genotypes sampled from infected plants after the course of a single infection  and therefore the invasion and co infection of cells in various organs and tissues is very close to natural More than half of the genomes       see Table   present in a CaMV population after a single passage in its host plant were identified as recombinants  and these data allowed us to infer a per nucleotide per generation recombination rate on the order of       to      
The time length of one generation  i e  the time required for a given genome to go from one replication to the next  is totally unknown in plant viruses 
The only experimental data available on CaMV are based on the kinetics of gene expression in infected protoplasts  where the capsid protein is produced between   and   h   
The reverse transcription and the encapsidation of genomic DNA being two coupled phenomena    we judged it reasonable to assume a generation time of   d and  thus  an average of ten generations during our experiments 
In case this estimate is mistaken  we have verified a linear relationship between r and the number of generations  thereby allowing an immediate adjustment of r if the CaMV generation time is more precisely established 
At this point  we must consider that all cloned genomes may not have been through all the successive replication events potentially allowed by the timing of our experiments 
It was previously shown that about   of CaMV mature virus particles accumulate in compact inclusion bodies    where they may be sequestered for a long time  as such inclusions are very frequent in all infected cells  including those in leaves that have been invaded by the virus population for several weeks 
The viral population may thus present an age structure that could bias the estimation of the recombination rate 
In order to minimize this bias  the clones we analyzed were collected in one young newly formed leaf  where the chances of finding genomes from  unsequestered lines  were assumed to be higher 
In any case  our data analysis is conservative  since this age structure can only lead to an underestimation of the recombination rate Our results show that interferences between pairs of loci are negative  a recombination event between two loci apparently increases the probability of recombination between another pair of loci 
We believe that the most parsimonious explanation of these negative interferences is based on the way the infection builds up within plant hosts 
Indeed  one can divide infected host cells into those infected by a single virus genotype and those infected by more than one viral genotype 
In the former  analogous to clonal propagation  recombination is undetectable 
In the latter  recombination is not only detectable but  as our results indicate  very frequent 
Samples consisting of viruses resulting from a mixture of these two types of host cell infections will thus contain viruses with no recombination and viruses with several recombination events  thus yielding an impression of negative interference 
These conceptual arguments are supported by mathematical models 
It is indeed easy to show  detailed results not shown  that if a proportion F of the population reproduces clonally  analogous to single infections  while the remaining reproduces panmictically  negative interferences could be inferred even if they do not exist 
For example  assuming a three locus model with real recombination rates r
  and r
  and interference i
  the  apparent  recombination and interference parameters  would be r
        F r  r
        F r
  and i
     F   i
    F 
Interestingly  this example also shows that our estimates of the recombination rate are conservative  that a fraction F of host cells are singly infected while others are multiply infected leads to an underestimation of the recombination rate As judged by r
  r
  and r
  calculated between markers a–b  b–c  and c–d  respectively  we found evidence for recombination through the entire CaMV genome 
The values for r
 
r
  and r
  are remarkably similar  hence the recombination sites seem to be evenly distributed along the genome 
We considered the template switching model as the major way recombinants are created in CaMV 
As already mentioned in the Introduction  hot spots of template switching have been predicted at the position of the  ′ extremities of the  S and  S RNAs   
If other recombination mechanisms  such as that associated with second strand DNA synthesis or with the host cell DNA repair machinery  act significantly  hot spots would be expected at the positions of the sequence interruption     and     
Due to the design of our experiment and the position of the four markers  we have no information on putative hot spots at positions corresponding to the  ′ end of the  S RNA and to    at nucleotide position  
Nevertheless  the putative hot spots at the  ′ end of the  S RNA and at   and    nucleotide positions   and   respectively  fall between marker pairs c–d  b–c  and a–b  respectively 
Our results indicate that either these hot spots are quantitatively equivalent though predicted by different recombination mechanisms or  more likely  that they simply do not exist 
Whatever the explanation  what we observe is that the CaMV can exchange any portion of its genome  and thus any gene thereof  with an astonishingly high frequency during the course of a single host infection To our knowledge  the viral recombination rate has never previously been quantified experimentally for a plant virus   
In contrast  retroviruses and particularly HIV  have been extensively investigated in that sense 
As we have already discussed for these latter cases  the quantification of the intrinsic recombination rate was carried out in artificially co infected cell cultures 
The estimated intrinsic per nucleotide per generation recombination rate in HIV  is on the order of      less than one order of magnitude higher than our estimation for CaMV 
Because for various reasons detailed above we probably underestimate the within host CaMV recombination rate  we believe that the intrinsic recombination rate in CaMV is higher and perhaps on the order of that of HIV Other pararetroviruses such as plant badnaviruses or vertebrate hepadnaviruses have a similar cycle within their host cells  including steps of nuclear minichromosome  genomic size RNA synthesis  and reverse transcription and encapsidation 
Nevertheless  vertebrate hepadnaviruses  e g  hepatitis B virus  infect hosts that are very different from plants in their biology and physiology  and this could lead to a totally different frequency of cell co infection during the development of the virus populations 
Thus  even though our results can be informative for other pararetroviruses because of the viruses  shared biological characteristics  they should not be extrapolated to vertebrate pararetroviruses without caution We used the plasmid pCa  which is the complete genome of the CaMV isolate Cabb S  cloned into the pBR  plasmid at the unique SalI restriction site   
To analyze recombination in different regions of the genome  we introduced four genetic markers  a  b  c  and d  at the positions       and   respectively  thus approximately at four cardinal points of the CaMV circular double stranded DNA of   bp  Figure  
All markers  each corresponding to a single nucleotide change  were introduced by PCR directed mutagenesis in pCa  and resulted in the duplication of previously unique restriction sites BsiWI  PstI  MluI  and SacI in a plasmid designated pMark S  Because  in this study  we targeted the possible exchange of genes between viral genomes  all markers a  b  c  and d were introduced within coding regions corresponding to open reading frames I  IV  V  and VI  respectively 
Another important concern was to quantify recombination in the absence of selection  i e  to create neutral markers 
Consequently all markers consist of synonymous mutations  see below To generate the parental virus particles  plasmids pCa  and pMark S were mechanically inoculated into individual plants as previously described   
All plants were turnips  B  rapa cv   Just Right  grown under glasshouse conditions at   °C with a    light dark  photoperiod 
Thirty days post inoculation  all symptomatic leaves were harvested and viral particles were purified as described earlier   The resulting preparations of parental viruses  designated Cabb S and Mark S  were quantified by spectrometry using the formula described by Hull et al 
  
We fixed the initial frequency of markers to a value of   and a solution containing   mg ml of virus particles of both Cabb S and Mark S at a   ratio was prepared 
Plantlets were co infected by mechanical inoculation of two to three leaves with   μl of this virus solution  using abrasive Celite AFA  Fluka  Ronkonkoma  New York  United States 
The mixed CaMV population was allowed to grow during   d of systemic infection We designed an experimental protocol for quantifying marker frequency within a mixed Cabb S Mark S virus population after a single passage in a host plant 
Twenty four individual plants  inoculated as above with equal amounts of Cabb S and Mark S  were harvested   d post inoculation  when symptoms were fully developed 
The viral DNA was purified from   mg of young newly formed infected leaves according to the protocol described previously   
After the precipitation step of this protocol  the viral DNA was resuspended and further purified with the Wizard DNA clean up kit  Promega  Fitchburg  Wisconsin  United States  in TE  X   mM Tris HCl and   mM EDTA  pH   
Aliquots of viral DNA preparations were digested by restriction enzymes corresponding either to marker a  b  c  or d and submitted to a   agarose gel electrophoresis  colored by ethydium bromide and exposed to UV 
Each individual restriction enzyme cut once in Cabb S DNA and twice in Mark S  thus generating DNA fragments of different sizes attributable to one or the other in the mixed population of CaMV genomes 
After scanning the agarose gels  we estimated the relative frequency of the two genotypes in each viral DNA preparation and at each marker position  by densitometry using the NIH   Image program 
The statistical analyses of the frequency of the four markers are described below To identify and quantify the recombinants within the CaMV mixed populations  aliquots from ten of the   viral DNA preparations described above were digested by the restriction enzyme SalI  and directly cloned into pUC  at the corresponding site 
In each of the ten viral populations analyzed    full genome length clones were digested separately by BsiWI  PstI  MluI  and SacI  to test for the presence of marker a  b  c  and d  respectively 
In this experiment  with the marker representing an additional restriction site  we could easily distinguish between the Cabb S and the Mark S genotype at all four marker positions  upon agarose gel   electrophoresis of the digested clones 
Clones with none or all four markers were parental genotypes  whereas clones harboring     or   markers were clearly recombinants 
Due to the very high number of recombinants detected  markers eventually appearing or disappearing due to spontaneous mutations were neglected Here we present the different methods we used to quantify recombination in the CaMV genome 
Because all these methods assume that the different markers are neutral  we first discuss assumption We used two datasets to test the neutrality of markers  both resulting from plants co infected with a   ratio of Mark S and Cabb S 
The first consisted of viral DNA densitometry data derived from   plants  described above  where for each plant we have an estimate of the frequency of each marker in the genome population 
The second consisted of the restriction of   individual full genome length viral clones obtained from one co infected plant  described above  yielding an estimate of the frequency of each marker  and this was repeated on ten different plants 
The frequencies of the different markers were       and   for markers a  b  c  and d in the first dataset and       and   in the second dataset 
We tested whether these frequencies were significantly different from the expected value under neutrality    using either t tests  for datasets where normality could not be rejected  seven out of eight cases  or Wilcoxon signed rank non parametric tests otherwise  marker c in the first dataset 
In all cases p values were larger than  There are several cautionary remarks regarding these analyses 
First  in all cases we found an excess of markers 
Unfortunately  the two datasets cannot be regarded as independent because  even though the methods through which the frequency estimates were obtained were different  the plants used in the second dataset were a subset of the plants of the first 
We thus have only four independent estimates in each case  and there is minimal power to detect significant deviations from neutrality with such a small sample size 
It should be noted at this stage that deviations from the expected value could also be caused either by slight deviations from the   ratio in the infecting mixed solution  or by deviations from that ratio in the frequency of the viral particles that actually get into the plants 
Second  because of the relatively small sample sizes and low statistical power  the tests presented above could have detected only large deviations The results clearly show  however  precisely that the markers do not have large effects  if any  and that therefore recombination estimates would be affected only very slightly by any hypothetical selective effects of the markers 
Because of this  along with the fact that the introduced markers provoke silent substitutions in the CaMV genome  we assumed that markers were effectively neutral in the rest of the analysis The dataset used to estimate the recombination frequency consisted of the   full genome length viral clones   from each of ten co infected plants  individually genotyped for each of the four markers 
As discussed in detail in the Results  recombination was very frequent and concerned all four markers 
Indeed  approximately half of the genotyped clones exhibited a recombinant genotype 
It was therefore meaningful to try to obtain quantitative estimates of recombination from our data Our aim was to analyze viral recombination in a live host 
Consequently  we had to deal with the fact that more than one viral replication cycle occurred during the   d that infection lasted in our experiment  we had to wait that long for the disease to develop and to be able to recover sufficient amounts of viral DNA from each infection 
Based on the kinetics of gene expression    we postulate that each replication cycle lasts between   and   d  and that therefore seven to ten cycles occurred between infection and the sampling time 
In case this assumption is incorrect  we did calculations assuming five  seven  ten  or   replication cycles during these   d  As shown  the results were not affected qualitatively  and only slightly quantitatively 
It is important to note that we assumed that recombination occurred through a template switching mechanism  and that therefore  from a recombination point of view  the CaMV genome is linear 
The reverse transcription starts and finishes at the position   in Figure   which is the point of circularization of the DNA genome 
This implies that changes between contiguous markers a–b  b–c  and c–d can be considered as true recombination whereas those between a and d cannot  as they may simply stem from circularization of DNA  during the synthesis of which the polymerase has switched template once anywhere between a–b  b–c  or c–d To estimate the recombination rate between markers  we wrote recurrence equations describing the change in frequency of each genotype over one generation  assuming random mating and no selection  i e  the standard Wright–Fisher population genetics model 
We then expressed the frequency of all possible genotypes n generations later as a function of their initial frequency and of the recombination parameters 
Subsequently we calculated the maximum likelihood estimates of the recombination parameters and their asymptotic variances given initial frequencies  we assumed that the two  parental  genotypes  Mark S and Cabb S  had equal initial frequencies of   and that all other genotypes had initial frequencies of zero  and frequencies after n generations  the observed frequencies  as stated above we used different values of n 
All algebraic and numerical calculations were carried out with the software Mathematica The recombination parameters are the recombination rates between two adjacent loci  e g  r
  for the recombination rate between markers a and b  and the interference coefficients  e g  i
  for interference between recombination events in the segments between markers a and b and b and c  To define these parameters we followed Christiansen    and in particular the recombination distributions for two  three  and four loci  respectively  Tables     and   of   
It is important to realize that given the definitions of these parameters  the estimator of the recombination rate between two loci is not affected by the number of loci considered 
In other words  we obtain the same estimation of the recombination rate between markers a and b whether we consider genotypic frequencies at just these two loci  or the frequencies at these two loci plus a third locus  or the complete information to which we have access  the four marker genotypes 
Information on additional loci only affects the estimates of the interference coefficients It proved impossible to carry out the calculations for four loci algebraically 
Instead  we used a computer program to calculate the expected genotypic frequencies at all four loci after n generations  given the above stated initial frequencies and specified recombination parameters 
For each combination of recombination parameters we calculated a Euclidean distance between the vector of the expected genotypic frequencies and the observed genotypic frequencies  and considered that the estimated recombination parameters were those yielding the minimal Euclidean distance 
In all cases  the estimated recombination rates between pairs of loci were equal to the second decimal to those estimated algebraically from data for three or two loci Tumor Restrictions to Oncolytic VirusIn most solid tumors the tumor interior displays a high cellular density with multiple cell types  both malignant and normal  stromal  cells  interdigitated by strands of extracellular matrix  ECM  and other poorly defined tissue 
Stromal cells typically consist of fibroblasts  macrophages  neutrophils and other immune cell types 
Tumor associated fibroblasts are a source of the bulk acellular tissue in tumors    which is largely made up of polysugars and glycoproteins  such as collagens  laminins  fibronectins  proteoglycans  hyaluronan and water  forming a dense matrix around and between the cancer cells   
This matrix provides structural support but also haptotactic and chemotactic guidance for cancer cells   
Moreover  the prevailing tumor interstitium is rich in soluble angiogenic factors  such as members of the vascular endothelial growth factor  VEGF  family    cellular growth factors  including endothelial growth factor  EGF  basic fibroblast growth factor  FGF  platelet derived growth factor  PDGF  and pleiotrophic factors  particularly transforming growth factor  TGF  beta   
Additionally  both tumor  and stromal cells secrete cytokines and chemokines  such as interleukin  IL    IL   tumor necrosis factor  TNF  alpha  stromal cell derived factor  SDF    macrophage migration inhibitory factor  MIF    which on one hand recruit more stromal and progenitor cells into the tumors and on the other hand curb the activity of antigen presenting cells and anti tumor T cells   
In several independent cancer types  high serum levels of IL   and IL   are indicators of poor prognosis   Aberrant tumor and stromal growth combined with an overproduction of matrix leads to high interstitial pressure in the tumor  preventing lateral diffusion of therapeutic compounds within the tumor 
Tight cellular compactness combined with a high tumor proliferation rate also causes physical crowding and puts constraints on oxygenation  which due to aberrant angiogenesis and rupture of the haphazard vessels is mostly incomplete and results in chronic tissue hypoxia toward the tumor cores 
As cancer cells exist in a crowding hypoxic  and cytokine growth factor perpetuated chronic state of stress  they upregulate a number of key cellular molecules that function as a collective defense against a wide range of therapies  including oncolytic viruses 
The properties of oncolytic viruses and their status in clinical development as well as various delivery options have been reviewed elsewhere   
In this review  we provide an overview of two of the main intratumoral barriers to oncolytic virus spread  the extracellular tumor make up and the intracellular antiviral defense mechanisms Tumor cellular structure and composition may in concert with abundant extracellular matrix  ECM  deposition pose a severe hurdle for systemic virus entry and propagation of infection within the tumor 
The extracellular matrix is a complex dense network consisting of multiple proteins  glycoproteins and polysaccharides including collagens  laminins  fibronectins  proteoglycans and hyaluronic acid   
The interstitial fluid pressure  IFP  in the tumor surrounding blood and lymphatic vessels is mainly created by the high cell density that forms an increased physical pressure outwards and does not allow free diffusion of therapeutics   
A high IFP generally predicts an aggressive tumor phenotype as tumor cells tend to escape from tumor margins where the pressure drops  thus facilitating spread of metastatic cells   
On the other hand  for therapeutic virus  interstitial fluid concentration gradients may pose a hurdle as passive diffusion in viable regions  typically the rim  may occur mainly outward   
Given the limited arsenal of known chemicals alleviating tumor compactness and the poor penetration drugs in general into the tumor tissue  this is a considerable problem that may not be easy to tackle 
Some strategies are discussed below Viruses are passive particles and rely either on radial cell to cell spread or on soluble diffusion across concentration gradients to reach their target cells and to propagate the infection 
Tumor matrix is critical in this regard  as it can block both forms of spread 
Passively diffusing viruses may physically not fit through the strands of the ECM 
This was shown for oncolytic herpes virus  which has an outer diameter of over   nm  and whose spreading could be improved by matrix degrading bacterial collagenase co injection   
Bilbao and coworkers showed that adenovirus entry into experimental hepatocellular carcinoma nodules in the livers of immunocompetent rats following intravenous or intraportal injection was directly related to the thickness of the ECM capsule enveloping the nodules   
On the other hand  we found using Semliki Forest virus  which has an outer diameter of about   nm  that even upon intratumoral injection spread was blocked by ECM  which formed a physical barrier for virus infection  Figure  The foremost option to reduce interstitial fluid pressure and to remove physical molecule barriers imposed by the ECM is to use matrix degrading enzymes 
These act by digesting collagen  fibrin  and other types of fibrillar matrix deposits  creating more space between cell clusters  and glycosaminoglycan polymers  known to limit fluid movement in tumors 
Simultaneously  such strategies may also expose more cell surface to viruses  increasing the likelihood of infection 
In a study by Kuriyama  trypsin or collagenase dispase was injected into subcutaneous U  and U  glioma xenografts in immunocompromised mice  followed by a reporter adenovirus   
Both types of ECM degrading enzymes increased tumor transduction by the virus  but when doses got too high  transduction efficacy suffered  demonstrating a balance between ECM degradation and oncolytic virus efficacy 
In another study  treatment of PC  tumors with vaccinia virus producing matrix metalloprotease  MMP    resulted in reduction of collagen IV fibrils and increase in virus penetration into tumor  which yielded elevated virus titers   
Hong et al 
targeted orthotopic neuroblastoma xenografts engineered to express MMP  with oncolytic HSV  achieving increased virus distribution compared to control tumors   
Similar results were obtained when human soft tissue sarcoma HSTS T overexpressing MMP  or MMP  were injected with oncolytic HSV   
MMP expressing tumors contained significantly less sulfated glycosaminoglycans compared to control tumors 
Other enzymes and protein effectors  either engineered into virus expression cassettes or provided exogenously  include hyaluronidase  decorin  various other MMPs  and notably relaxin a peptide hormone normally expressed during particular phase of pregnancy that does not possess tissue degrading activity itself  but instead induces a number of key collagen degrading proteases seemingly in a tumor specific manner   
Beyer showed that relaxin expressed by murine stem cells improved trastuzumab penetrance and therapy outcome in syngeneic tumor models   
In another study  chimeric adenovirus Ad  expressing relaxin showed increased tumor transduction and virus dissemination   Several other strategies to increase penetration of therapeutics in tumors have been developed   
While the stromal ECM capsule of tumor nodules acts as a physical barrier to virus entry following intravenous injection  it was possible to improve tumor infection by administering vaso active compounds  angiotensin II  histamine  nitroglycerine  before the virus   
This is interesting  as vasculature per se would not be expected to alter or influence the physical composition of the ECM  such as collagen strand thickness 
Instead  virus access to the tumor was improved  most likely by increased access from the blood via tumor stromal adjoining vessels 
Interestingly  in a study with oncolytic herpes virus  anti VEGF monoclonal antibody Bevacizumab given before intravenous virus injection gave poorer anti tumor efficacy than when given after the virus   
The study showed that while HSV is able to enter and infect tumors better through their leaky vasculature compared to Bevacizumab normalized vasculature  vascular normalization by Bevacizumab still gave superior combination efficacy when the virus was already in the tumor 
This effect was likely dependent on altering both physical and biological properties of the tumor  including interstitial pressure and oxygenation 
In another study  anti VEGF A antibody injections in nude mice harboring U  human glioma xenografts led to an increase in MMP  expression and reduction in collagen fiber content  facilitating improved distribution of oncolytic adenovirus within the tumor tissue   
In general  targeting tumor vasculature by oncolytic viruses and including agents that affect tumor vasculature in combination regimens is gaining interest    and it will be interesting to see more specific studies on how vascular acting agents may affect the physical barriers to oncolytic viruses Some viruses do not need an extracellular step for propagating infection  such as members of the herpes and poxvirus families  and may be able to spread from cell to cell 
For example  HSV  is able to infect neighboring cells via lateral tight junctions in a manner dependent on its glycoproteins E and I   
Vaccinia virus  on the other hand  induces so called actin tails  which are actin filament driven membranous protrusions of the plasma membrane harboring a single virus particle at the outer tip 
These actin tails actively deliver and deposit virus particles onto or even into neighboring cells   
Because lateral spread without an extracellular step may circumvent neutralizing immunity as well as some of the physical obstacles the tumor microenvironment imposes  this ability has been engineered into viruses that normally do not possess it 
A promising strategy is to engineer OVs to express membrane fusogenic genes  MFGs  such as gibbon ape leukemia virus  GALV  glycoprotein  reptilian reovirus p  protein  FAST  or the membrane glycoproteins H and F of measles virus   
Quite intriguingly  expression of several different MFGs by oncolytic adenovirus synergized with chemotherapy in anti tumor efficacy both in vitro and in vivo    suggesting that membrane fusion facilitated lateral spread of also chemotherapeutics  which otherwise would not have occurred in a compact tumor 
The potential limitation of cell to cell dependent spread  however  may be that membrane free physical barriers  such as the ECM  may still pose a barrier to spread 
Also  it is unclear whether MFGs or other mechanisms of lateral spread may assist in reaching distant tumor nests Some other strategies to alleviate matrix imposed restrictions to oncolytic viruses have been discussed elsewhere   Tumors of epithelial origin mostly retain the firm cellular integrity seen in their original adhesive intercellular configuration 
Several viruses use cellular receptors which are located in paracellular tight junctions  which may be problematic in tightly packed tumors   
Adenovirus C group viruses use coxsackie adenovirus receptor  CAR  as their primary entry point  whereas adenovirus B  group members and measles virus Edmonston use CD  complement binding molecule as their cellular receptor   
Adenovirus B  group  serotypes       and   entry occurs using desmoglein   DSG    
Of these  CAR and DSG  are preferentially located within tight junctions and are hidden from virus binding   
Also the complement receptor CD  was ascribed a role in maintenance of epithelial cell integrity by interactions with the E cadherin catenin network   
These observations imply that before reaching the potential entry site on the tumor cell the virus must find its way into the junctional space 
Moreover  it has become increasingly clear that for example glioma tumors traditionally targeted by Ad  serotype adenoviruses often express only low levels of CAR and instead much higher levels of CD    Beyond that tight junctions hide multiple virus receptors  they contain a network of adhesion molecules  including ZO  cadherins  claudins and occludin  which  if perturbed  is associated with more aggressive disease in many types of cancer   
Since tight junctions also contain important receptors that mediate tumor promoting signaling and which have been targeted by monoclonal antibodies  notably Her  it would be highly useful to develop strategies that temporarily loosen the tight junction contacts even at cost of a transient increase in tumor metastatic risk 
One of the most interesting approaches has been to exploit the natural propensity of adenovirus serotype   which as part of its natural life cycle creates dodecahedral particles  PtDd  consisting of viral capsid proteins  penton base and fiber that open tight junctions by binding to and dissolving desmoglein  dimers and reducing E cadherin expression  to develop a specific tight junction opening molecule  JO    
Adenovirus type   uses PtDds to promote its own infection  opening the tight junctions ahead of infection to maximize access to desmoglein 
Analogously  when administered to human tumor xenografts  JO  facilitated penetration of trastuzumab much deeper into the tumor tissue than when the monoclonal antibody was administered on its own   
Moreover  JO  synergized with several chemotherapeutics in solid tumor models   
Backed by our own findings with oncolytic SFV  showing that both extracellular matrix and tumor cell compactness restrict virus spread and oncolytic efficacy  we believe combination approaches that target both tight junctions and extracellular matrix will prove effective in future virotherapy development  Figure  An alternative approach to increasing tumor penetration by oncolytic viruses is to alter tumor cell morphology and status 
Notably  cell death and in particular the type of cell death induced by virus has been shown to affect virus distribution within a tumor mass  in a study by Nagano et al  administration of apoptosis inducing paclitaxel before injecting oncolytic herpes simplex virus increased virus dissemination in the tumor  allowing its diffuse in  tunnels  created by shrinking dying tumor cells   Maintenance of physiological adherence is essential for proper ECM function and for retaining cellular integrity 
Therefore  a potential caveat of using ECM degrading proteolytic enzymes or tight junction openers is the risk of neoplastic cell detachment from the tumor ECM and increased risk of metastasis 
While ECM degradation or tight junction opening may operate innocuously  there is also a chance that loss of E cadherins via proteases or via non specific deregulation of tight junction integrity during ECM modulating therapy could trigger pro tumorigenic Wnt β catenin signaling  possibly driving epithelial to mesenchymal transition   
One study showed that ectopic relaxin expression stimulated MMP expression and enhanced breast cancer invasiveness    whereas another paper found short term relaxin exposure to increase breast cancer cell motility whereas long term expression reduced both motility and cancer invasiveness   
In the context of oncolytic viruses  Lavilla Alonso tested several proteases  including hyaluronidase  relaxin  and macrophage metalloelastase  and showed they all could assist adenovirus entry into tumors  yet  the authors did not detect treatment induced metastases or increase in tumor invasiveness   
Another strategy possibly balancing some of the putative risks of tight junction disruption could be to use Wnt dependent oncolytic viruses   Tumors are invariably fenestrated by host fibroblasts  myeloid cells and other non transformed cells  which driven by cancer induced cues can adopt various reprogrammed phenotypes to promote tumor angiogenesis and growth and to alter tumor responses to therapies   
As most of them normally play a role in immune homeostasis and pathogen sensing  they also respond to and influence oncolytic virus infection of tumors Fulci et al 
reported that injection of oncolytic HSV  directly into glioblastoma tumor parenchyma triggered upregulation of CD  and CD  monocytic markers and rapid clearance of virus  likely executed by infiltrating phagocytic cells   
When clodronate liposomes were used to deplete macrophages in vivo  the authors observed a  fold increase in virus titers in the brain tumors concomitant with an   reduction in peripheral CD  macrophages in animal spleens  suggesting that CD  cells migrate into the tumors upon virus injection and limit overall oncolytic efficacy 
While CD  cells were not reduced by peripheral macrophage depletion  arguing that these cells had been recruited to the tumors before the treatment  they could be eliminated in live glioma slices ex vivo  resulting in a  fold increase in virus replication 
Macrophages may secrete antiviral type I interferon constitutively at very low  subnanomolar  levels   and recently Liu et al 
showed that tumor resident CD  macrophages induced a protective antiviral state in ovarian and breast tumors which led to resistance to oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus  VSV  infection   
Type I IFN signaling  JAK  inhibitor Ruxolitinib reversed the resistance  facilitating VSV replication in the macrophage protected cancer cells 
It is tempting to speculate that tumor resident macrophages also rendered syngeneic GL  and DBT mouse gliomas completely refractory to VA  oncolytic alphavirus  as these cells were quite infectable in vitro and live glioma slices regained their sensitivity to virus within   h  indicating dilution of IFN I   Macrophages or the closely related myeloid suppressor cells are the predominant stromal cell type in many tumors and are actively recruited during cancer progression   
Heavy macrophage presence in the tumors indicates that such tumors may be resistant to oncolytic virotherapy  unless depleting preconditioning would be used 
Moreover  as part of the early immune response to virus infection  monocytic cells are rapidly recruited to tumors following intratumoral virus injection 
In one study  depletion of either CD b  cells or VEGF secreted by these cells in mice treated with oncolytic HSV  greatly increased oncolytic efficacy  tentatively linking pro tumorigenic and antiviral angiogenic mechanisms   Another key pro tumorigenic signaling employed by many tumors is up regulation of CXCR  the receptor for chemokine CXCL   also known as SDF  and recruitment of stromal cells expressing CXCL  which maintain the tumor and recruit additional cells to support tumor expansion and invasion  such as endothelial cell progenitors which contribute to neovascularization   
Indeed  high CXCR  expression is a negative prognostic factor for many cancers 
Oncolytic vaccinia virus engineered to express a soluble antagonist of CXCR  showed improved intratumoral virus replication  increased vascular disruption and a markedly reduced infiltration of the tumors by putative immune suppressive and tumor promoting stromal cells   
This study highlights how reducing pro tumor stromal cell effects may alleviate antiviral resistance and yield increased overall therapeutic efficacy 
On the other hand  if the paracrine antiviral effects of tumor homing monocytic cells could be selectively abrogated these cells could favorably be used to ferry oncolytic viruses into tumors 
Indeed  a significant delay in metastatic tumor potential was achieved when macrophages were harnessed to deliver a tumor specific oncolytic adenovirus   What is the antiviral status in human cancer 
Recent analyses from different normal cells that occupy the same organ reveal striking functional variation in components of the type I IFN signaling pathway that correlate with the tissue tropism and virulence of some virus strains   
Can similar variation in such components be found in cancer cells  or do cancer cells make an exception Transformed cells undergo selective elimination by the immune system before becoming cancerous  termed immunoediting  based on observations of differential capacity of immunocompetent mice to reject tumors previously grown in immunocompromised hosts versus syngeneic animals   
Cancer cell responsiveness to type I and type II IFNs plays a role during immunoediting  cancer cells that eventually progress to form a tumor display reduced capacity to respond to IFN gamma  which otherwise would upregulate MHC class I molecules and render the tumors amenable to CD  T cell mediated destruction  whereas responsiveness to type I interferon initially helps tumors avoid immune purging during the editing phase and is then irrelevant   
Of note  the anti tumor effects of type I IFN  still exploited today in several cancers  were shown to depend on host NK cells  and mice in which IFNAR was blocked by monoclonal antibody failed to reject even highly immunogenic tumors  as opposed to mice treated with control antibody  who all rejected the immunogenic tumor challenge   
Thus  whereas tumor responsiveness to type I IFN is not predetermined after immunoediting  other factors post immunoediting may influence it In several tumor types  varying levels of expression of components of the type I IFN signaling cascade have been detected  and in some tumor types these components have been found to have prognostic value  whereas in others they do not seem to influence survival   
However  emerging data suggests that antiviral genes may predict poor survival because they increase treatment resistance 
In one study  poor prognosis of several types of cancer due to genotoxic treatment resistance was found to correlate with increased activity of IFN I pathway genes   
In this study  a triad of type I IFN signaling pathway genes  STAT  ISG  and IFIT  formed a pan tumor type negative prognostic factor  and a broader seven gene cluster established negative prognostic criteria for treatment resistant breast cancer 
Treatment resistance was subsequently shown to depend on STAT  signaling  STAT expressing tumor clones were positively selected in animals in vivo  demonstrating increased proliferation and metastatic potential  and STAT expression mediated resistance against genotoxic assault by doxorubicin or ionizing radiation  knockdown of STAT  resulted in lower proliferation rate and metastatic capacity and increased sensitivity to genotoxic stress    
In another study  resistance to epigenetic DNA modifiers  AZA dC  a methyltransferase inhibitor  and LBH  or MGCD  both histone deacetylase  HDAC  inhibitors  was correlated with increased expression of IFN I pathway genes in small lung cancer cells   
Basal IFN related gene expression in several different SML cell lines was upregulated Interestingly  in many cancers  STAT proteins are not phosphorylated and persist in unphosphorylated form  U STAT 
Like its phosphorylated counterpart  U STAT  increases expression of genes contributing to resistance to DNA damaging agents   
While it is currently unknown why cancers may prefer to use unphosphorylated forms  it is known that U STATs activate distinct signals compared to their phosphorylated counterparts 
However  importantly for oncolytic viruses  in many tumors  constant expression and release of type I IFN leads to a constitutively high level of unphosphorylated forms of STAT  STAT  and IRF  which together form an unphosphorylated but functional ISGF like complex that relocalizes to the nucleus and drives expression of a specific set of ISGs distinct from acute IFN I exposure   
These ISGs are sufficient to maintain a functional antiviral defense and they play a critical role in resistance to DNA damaging agents On a cellular level  virus replication is controlled by antiviral defense molecules    which in turn are primarily controlled by type I IFN signaling 
In addition to classical type I IFN  or cytokine induced antiviral signaling  tumors may employ other antiviral defense mechanisms 
For example  stromal cells may secrete peptides with antiviral properties called defensins   
The defensins are amphiphatic and typically  –  amino acids in length and interfere with viruses by physically binding to and disrupting virus particles and or by inducing antiviral responses in target cells via pattern recognition receptors 
At least oral squamous cell carcinomas were found to overexpress defensins compared to normal control tissues   
While the role of defensins in oncolytic virus infection of tumors is unclear  one study showed that the immune stimulating properties of defensins may be exploited to increase overall therapeutic efficacy 
In this study  expression of beta   defensin from a conditionally replicating adenovirus yielded a superior therapeutic entity compared to the unarmed parental virus via enhanced anti tumor immune responses mediated by TLR dependent activation of dendritic cells   In summary  human cancers display varying degrees of expression of antiviral proteins or their signaling regulators at baseline 
Some of these may increase in response to genotoxic anti cancer treatments 
In the next chapter we will highlight some of the consequences to oncolytic virotherapy of the heterogeneity in type I IFN responsiveness in tumor cells All oncolytic viruses tested to date display variable infectivity in different cancer cell lines 
This variability is likely at least partly dependent on type I IFN as most oncolytic viruses are IFN sensitive 
IFN secretion follows virus sensing by the cells via Toll like receptors expressed on both the plasma membrane and in endocytotic vesicles  NOD like receptors  STING  AIM  NLP inflammosome and other danger sensing molecules  summarized elsewhere   
While all viruses carry an arsenal of counteracting molecules    no virus goes completely undetected 
Even HSV amplicons  which are devoid of functional virus genes  induce a type I IFN response that mediates a STAT dependent system wide antiviral defense in mice within one hour of intravenous vector injection  resulting in significant reduction of transgene expression compared to expression in STAT  knockout animals   During our own studies with attenuated SFV vector VA  it became apparent that the dramatic and lasting therapeutic efficacy achieved following mere single intravenous  or intratumoral  injection of the virus in immunocompromised mice bearing human A  melanoma or U  glioma xenografts   was not going to be recapitulated easily in immunocompetent animals   
The paradox in our studies was that while oncolytic SFV vector VA  effectively replicated in and destroyed a variety of IFN responsive cancer cell lines in vitro  it consistently failed to eradicate tumors generated from the same cell types in vivo  even if large doses of virus were injected directly into the tumor mass and even if the tumors were void of visible physical barriers  Figure  
Conversely  only tumors generated from IFN unresponsive cancer cells have seemed infectable in vivo by VA  so far 
In light of earlier findings by others  showing that type I IFN receptor knockout mice are highly susceptible to SFV infection and quickly succumb to multi organ systemic infection    the parameters for oncolytic SFV efficacy seem clear  tumor cells must be defective in type I IFN response for the virus to be effective These findings are in line with emerging data from other groups  showing a remarkably strict dependence of oncolytic virus replication on defective type I IFN responsiveness  a dogma introduced at the turn of the  st century   
For example  sarcomas and melanomas display differing permissiveness to oncolytic VSV  an obstacle which may be overcome by blocking type I IFN signaling   
In eight sarcoma cell lines  basal up regulation of RIG I and IFIT  and rapid induction of STAT  phosphorylation upon IFN I treatment correlated with resistance to oncolytic measles virus   
In other studies  human pancreatic and ovarian cancer cells display resistance against Rb dependent oncolytic adenovirus  strongly correlating with intracellular levels of MxA  and acquired resistance to repeated oncolytic adenovirus injections in an intraperitoneal ovarian carcinoma model was associated with an increase in MxA as well as several other key ISGs in the tumors   
A study comparing normal human or mouse melanocytes to a panel of melanoma cells revealed strong correlation between permissiveness to oncolytic VSV and capacity to mount antiviral defense in response to type I IFN   
In this study  VSV rp  harboring two mutations in P and L genes  was superior to several other tested oncolytic VSV strains  but the dependence on defective IFN responsiveness was still retained 
In yet another study  oncolytic VSV replicated in four out of twelve mesothelioma cell lines which were unable to mount antiviral defense upon IFN beta pretreatment or to respond to infection by up regulation of PKR  MxA or  OAS mRNA   
In contrast  the non permissive mesothelioma cells mounted antiviral defense  associated with PKR  MxA or  OAS mRNA up regulation  in response to infection or to exogenous type I IFN 
The authors of this study further linked the observed pattern of virus resistance to clinical mesothelioma samples  where in a mesothelioma tissue array  significant variance in immunoreactivity against PKR  p  and or IFNAR was observed  with only a few samples displaying lack of reactivity against all three components  arguing that most tumors in clinical settings would display at least some level of resistance to oncolytic VSV Oncolytic adenoviruses are often deleted for E A  which normally binds Rb and prevents it from sequestering E F  which results in the viruses being unable to replicate in normal cells 
However  since adenovirus  as with all viruses  contains elements that antagonize antiviral defenses  such elements have also been targets for deletion to render the virus sensitive to innate antiviral defenses  which would be expected to remain intact only in normal cells 
Cancer cells expressing Ras may down regulate protein kinase R and inhibit type I IFN induction by interfering with RIG I signaling   
Also  select interferon stimulated genes appear to be repressed by the Ras MEK ERK signaling cascade   
PKR activation shuts down E F dependent translation  including translation of virus messenger RNAs 
Therefore  an adenovirus deleted for VA RNA  which antagonizes PKR  should be capable of replicating in Ras overexpressing  tumor  cells 
However  while this was seemingly the case    it was later discovered that Ras is not an obligatory determinant for PKR inactivation and that virus replication was halted even in Ras overexpressing cells via functional PKR mediated E F phosphorylation  implying that the parameters of VA RNA deleted adenovirus replication had to be revised   
Similar findings were obtained with oncolytic reovirus  against which Ras independent tumor resistance emerged in vivo   
Thus  under some circumstances even tumor cells over expressing Ras may respond to type I IFN or to stimulants of pattern recognition receptors  activating PKR and inhibiting virus translation 
To complicate matters  MEK inhibitors have been shown restore antiviral signaling capacity in Ras overexpressing tumors   
This implies that human tumors treated with MEK inhibitors  such as Trametinib which was recently approved for treatment of BRAF mutated melanoma  may be poor targets for oncolytic viruses as antiviral signaling capacity in such tumors may be restored Some oncolytic viruses  such as members of the poxvirus family  are seemingly resistant to the antiviral effects of type I IFNs in vitro and may be controlled by other cellular factors   
However  in most cases  sensitivity or resistance to type I IFN is assessed in vitro and using only one cytokine  which may mask synergies with other factors present in vivo 
One possible explanation for the in vitro–in vivo discrepancy is the tumor micro environment  which not only imposes physical barriers to oncolytic viruses but also alters intracellular antiviral defenses 
For example  glioma cells were found in the brain to spontaneously secrete type I IFN  which conferred resistance against oncolytic HSV 
Resistance was linked to ECM protein CCN  interaction with glioma cell surface receptor alpha   beta   integrin  which activated interferon secretion   
It is tempting to speculate whether this or a similar ECM glioma interaction could have contributed to the resistance of syngeneic glioma cells we observed in vivo but not in vitro to both oncolytic SFV and vaccinia virus  FIG    
Also  while critical in many respects  antiviral signaling may occur without signaling via type I IFN receptor  IFNAR 
For instance  upon infection of IFNAR KO mice with murine hepatitis virus  MHV  brain cells were found to have upregulated antiviral GTPase TGTP and IFITm  and IFITm  all of which have confirmed antiviral activity in vivo against a variety of viruses   
In these cases  IFN gamma and TNF alpha likely account for at least part of the observed ISG activity  where e g  TGTP is upregulated by IFN γ signaling and TNFα has been shown to induce ISG  independently of IFNAR   Interestingly  while most cancers are heterogeneous in antiviral defence signaling  one broad class of tumors in particular may display consistently low capacity to ward off oncolytic viruses  oncovirus induced cancers 
This is because oncoviruses  as all viruses  carry a complement of factors that abrogate antiviral sensors and effectors  which may result in tumors that are uniformly devoid of antiviral signaling 
In an intriguing study  oncolytic VSV infected and destroyed human papilloma virus  HPV positive cervical carcinoma cells more effectively than HPV negative head  and neck cancer cells due to HPV E mediated suppression of antiviral signaling   
HPV positive or E expressing xenografts were efficiently eradicated from nude mice following VSV injection 
The potential of this approach is that even oncolytic viruses that are extremely sensitive to type I IFN  such as attenuated SFV or M mutated VSV  may function well against oncovirus induced cancers where the oncovirus machinery ensures the lack of antiviral defense While on first thought it would appear counterintuitive to antagonize the very factors that keep oncolytic viruses tumor specific  emerging data shows that this can be accomplished in a safe way 
One of the foremost strategies to increase oncolytic virus efficacy is to combine them with drugs that lower tumor antiviral defenses 
In this regard  a primary target for interference is the prototypical type I IFN signaling cascade 
While small molecular inhibitors against IFNAR are not available  activity of downstream signaling transducers may effectively be blocked 
Human pancreatic cancer cells were shown to constitutively express high levels of MxA and OAS and to mount type I IFN dependent resistance to oncolytic VSV 
Resistance could be overcome by blocking activity of IFNAR associated Janus kinase  JAK      
Similarly  JAK  inhibitor ruxolitinib overcame type I IFN dependent resistance of human SCC  head and neck cancer cells against oncolytic VSV   
Ruxolitinib also successfully abrogated type I IFN mediated antiviral effects elicited by macrophages    highlighting that this drug might also alleviate type I IFN dependent tumor resistance to oncolytic viruses imposed by stromal cells 
However  the obvious downside to using JAK inhibitors is their effects on critical host defense mechanisms  which may result in increased infection of normal cells 
Moreover  JAK inhibitors may reduce anti tumor immune responses elicited by oncolytic virotherapy 
For example  ruxolitinib was shown to impair the capacity of dendritic cells promote CD  T cell responses against model tumor antigens   
On the other hand  in this study clearance of adenovirus was delayed in ruxolitinib treated normal animals  which makes it difficult to predict the overall impact of JAK inhibitors on tumor therapy where prolonged virus presence might translate to better therapeutic efficacy 
Also  while the immune stimulating and anti tumor effects of type I and type II interferons may be adversely affected by JAK inhibitors  central tumor promoting cascades mediated by JAKs  such as IL STAT  may also be inhibited    yielding a difficult to predict net therapeutic outcome 
At the moment  more studies are needed to establish the overall impact of interference with JAK  signaling in cancer therapy Spurred by earlier reports of oncovirus reactivation and promoter enhancement by histone deacetylase  HDAC  inhibitors  this class of agents was assessed for capacity to enhance oncolytic virus potency by inhibiting antiviral responses 
Indeed  such enhancement was observed with oncolytic VSV and SFV  and while it has been difficult to pinpoint the exact mechanisms that underlie HDAC inhibitor enhancement of oncolytic virus replication in cancer cells  antiviral defenses in general are inhibited for yet unknown reasons mainly in cancer cells and not in normal cells  which indirectly facilitates virus replication   
Interestingly  combination of HDAC inhibitors with conditionally replicating   E A deleted adenovirus gave improved virus replication rate and therapeutic efficacy in subcutaneous xenograft models only when the inhibitors were given before the virus  otherwise inhibition of replication was observed   
Similarly  HDAC inhibitors increased replication and oncolytic efficacy of HSV when given before the virus but not when given at the same time   
With nuclear DNA viruses  such as adenovirus and HSV  it is possible that HDAC inhibitors also alter virus genome accessibility to transcription factors  resulting in reduced replication or other adverse effects  implying that with these viruses HDAC inhibitors should be administered before the viruses Recently  it was found that HDAC inhibitor vorinostat activates NfκB signaling by facilitating hyperacetylation of the p  subunit  which in turn activates cellular autophagy   
Autophagy was in another study shown to be important for VSV replication  presumably by inhibiting antiviral signaling 
This is interesting  as a previous study revealed enhancement of VSV replication by inhibiting TNF alpha induced antiviral signaling mediated by p  using NfκB inhibitors BMS  or TPCA    
In this study  neither inhibitor had an effect on STAT  or STAT  phosphorylation or their nuclear relocalization in response to type I IFN but the authors observed clear induction of ISG  GBP  and MX  in response to type I IFN in U  glioma cells  with the latter two being dependent on NfκB signaling 
Taken together  NfκB pathway activation may result in different antiviral responses in different cancer types  and inhibition or enhancement of oncolytic viruses by NfκB inhibitors is dependent on other concomitant cellular mechanisms  such as autophagy Since HDAC inhibitors modulate promoter activity accessibility  it is conceivable other epigenetic or promoter modifying agents could work in a similar manner to repress antiviral defense induction and enhance oncolytic viruses   
DNA demethylating agents  azacytidine  Aza  and decitabine synergized with oncolytic herpes simplex type   virus in glioma models in vitro and in vivo  as did HDAC inhibitor valproic acid  VPA  which was already shown before to work well with oncolytic HSV as well as several other oncolytic viruses   
Moreover  inhibition of cancer antiviral defenses  specifically RNAseL and PKR  resulted when cancer cells were exposed to sunitinib  a multi tyrosine kinase inhibitor originally developed as an inhibitor of VEGF R and PDGF R signaling  yielding strong anti tumor synergy with IFN sensitive oncolytic VSV   
Since sunitinib is approved for renal cell carcinoma and imatinib resistant gastric cancers  combination with oncolytic VSV constitutes a promising and clinically relevant approach warranting further investigation 
Interstingly  sunitinib as well as several other receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors displayed antiviral effects against polyomavirus BK    arguing that these compounds are not universal virus enhancers Cyclophosphamide  CPA  is a general immunosuppressant used to minimize Treg presence during immunotherapy and also oncolytic virotherapy 
CPA may  however  also enhance replication and efficacy of oncolytic viruses by diminishing cytokine secretion by stromal cells  including type I IFN   
Another compound enhancing oncolytic virus efficacy by lowering cell responsiveness to type I IFN is triptolide  which acts downstream of IRF  activation   
Further  the kinase mammalian target of rapamycin  mTOR  enhances the antiviral effects of type I IFN by activation of its effector proteins  E BP  which binds and inactivates translation factor eIF E  and S K  which carries out cell type specific signaling functions of type I IFN  such as activation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor  B and promotion of ISG  transcription 
Consequently  rapamycin was able to enhance oncolytic VSV replication and anti tumor efficacy by inhibiting type I IFN mediated antiviral signaling via mTOR   Several other compounds synergizing with oncolytic viruses have been identified via high throughput drug library screening  many of which seem to act by antagonizing antiviral defenses 
For instance  a novel virus sensitizer  Vse  was found to greatly diminish antiviral effects of type I IFN against oncolytic VSV in several cancer cell types  and the drug also synergized with the virus in subcutaneous mouse tumor models   
For many of these new compounds  the mechanism of action is still poorly understood  necessitating extensive safety studies to exclude undesirable effects against normal cells Apart from classical type I IFN induced antiviral defenses  which typically prevent virus translation and degrade virus genomes  other cellular machineries regulate oncolytic virus efficacy 
Notably  strategies to increase cancer cell death in response to oncolytic viruses have been tested 
In a recent study  a class of compounds called SMAC mimetics synergized in several cancer models with oncolytic VSV by removing cancer cell block to apoptosis in response to virus induced type I IFN  TNF α or TRAIL   
Interestingly  since virus infection triggered cytokines act on nearby non infected cells  SMAC mimetics may in combination with oncolytic viruses also cause significant bystander tumor destruction 
Normal cells are not affected by the IFN SMAC mimetic synergy  providing an important safety aspect 
In another study  blocking the ER stress response circuitry triggered by oncolytic rhabdovirus infection by a small molecular inhibitor of serine threonine protein kinase and endoribonuclease IRE α  which was identified in a genome wide siRNA screen  greatly enhanced cytotoxicity via caspase induced apoptosis and increased oncolytic efficacy in refractory tumor models in mice   
This effect was independent on induction or responsiveness to type I IFN 
Conversely  inhibitors of nucleoside transporter   ENT  were discovered from a high throughput screen of enhancers of oncolytic HSV  and to date such inhibitors have not been reported to alter cellular antiviral responses   
Other compounds  such as common chemotherapeutics  and their mechanisms synergizing with oncolytic viruses have been discussed elsewhere for most of them the possible role of antiviral defense antagonism in enhancing oncolytic virus efficacy remains to be studied   Thus  many compounds are available to interfere with tumor antiviral defenses 
The outstanding question for most of them  however  seems to be why such compounds do not render normal cells sensitive to oncolytic viruses 
Elucidation of the exact mechanisms of action and the differences between normal and cancer cells constitute a worthy goal for studies in the near future Already in the  s it became clear that using certain pathogenic wildtype viruses  such as West Nile virus and Bunyamwera virus  in cancer patients would result in off target toxicity   
Characteristic for pathogenic viruses is a greater ability to circumvent or antagonize cellular innate antiviral defenses than attenuated strains 
For example  unlike the prototypical oncolytic reovirus strain type   Dearing  the T L strain of reovirus causes accumulation of IRF  in the nucleus and inhibits activation of a select group of ISGs yet because of this property the T L strain is myocarditic unlike the oncolytic type   Dearing strain   
For these reasons  many oncolytic viruses used today  such as reovirus type   Dearing  oncolytic strains of Newcastle disease virus and M mutated VSV have either a stronger capacity to induce or a weaker capacity to resist antiviral type I IFN than the corresponding wildtype strains   An open question  however  is whether strain specific or virus specific differences that relate to specific components of the cellular antiviral machinery may be exploited for greater anti tumor efficacy  i e  if one virus fails  could another be used in its stead 
While Ras expression was critical for oncolytic reovirus replication in cells overexpressing CUG  oncogene  oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus was unable to replicate in the same cells due to increased activation of STAT  and OASL    
Thus  in these cells reovirus was not affected by STAT  or OASL  and it therefore remains interesting to see which other antiviral effectors may have been lacking in the CUG expressing cells and  conversely  how reovirus and VSV differ in terms of sensitivity to antiviral effectors 
While several oncolytic viruses have been compared to each other in terms of replication rate and cytotoxicity  systematic studies with regard to tumor antiviral defenses have not been conducted As any attenuated virus is likely to replicate effectively only in its own niche  i e  to be restricted by a specific set of ISGs  and as wild type strains may be too toxic for use in humans  a compromise may be achieved by incorporating select elements from wild type viruses into oncolytic virus backbones 
Indeed  several chimeric and recombinant viruses have been generated that harbor specific elements of wild type strains or even of other unrelated viruses in order to better resist cancer antiviral defenses  Table  
As an example of introducing wild type elements into attenuated viruses  Haralambieva reported on a measles virus Edmonston vaccine strain in which P gene was replaced with the counterpart from the wild type IC B strain   
Later  Meng et al 
included N  P  and L genes from wild type measles in Edmonston backbone  producing an enhanced but still safe oncolytic virus   
Edmonston vaccine virus induces a more robust IFN response compared to wild type measles virus partly due to the weaker ability of V protein to suppress MDA mediated activation of IRF  and IFN I induction   
In vivo  P gene encoded proteins  particularly V  control the quality of the cytokine response to measles so that vaccine strains qualitatively induce a stronger inflammatory response compared to WT strains  where WT V protein suppresses multiple cytokine secretion 
V protein short cytoplasmic tail has been shown to bind and inactivate STAT  IRF  MDA  and the Rel homology domain of the NfκB subunit p  but not of p    
Also  V causes LGP  protein to bind and inactivate RIG I    but it seemingly does not interfere with TICAM   TRIF  multiple TLR adaptor  including TLR mediated IFN β induction 
Thus  if cancer and normal cells would differ with regard to TICAM  or IRF  then such a virus could potentially target specifically cancer cells rather than normal cells 
So far  the measles Edmonston WT chimeras have proven safe in animals As an example of heterologous virus constructs  lentogenic Newcastle disease virus engineered to express influenza virus PR   H N  NS  showed enhanced oncolytic efficacy in vivo due to dampening of antiviral responses   
While such a virus did not display enhanced pathogenicity in that study  a mesogenic NDV virus harboring NS  from influenza strain H N  did show increased pathogenicity in chickens as well as an increased ability to replicate in human cells    raising some cautionary warnings for future engineering of similar replicative viruses 
As another example  vaccinia virus soluble type I IFN scavenger B R  NOTE  B R is often used in the literature  has been engineered into both oncolytic HSV and oncolytic rhabdoviruses  resulting in all cases in more effective therapy agents without loss of tumor specificity   
Oncolytic γ  gene deleted HSV was complemented by two different PKR antagonists from human cytomegalovirus  TRS  and IRS  generating a chimera capable of reaching wild type virus replication levels in cancer cells in vitro and in tumor models in vivo   The selection of various viral IFN I antagonists that potentially could be used to augment attenuated oncolytic viruses is vast   
For example  increased replication of several viruses  including HIV  Sindbis virus and E deleted adenovirus in mammalian cells was observed when the cells were engineered to express vaccinia virus E L protein  influenza A virus NS  protein  ebola virus VP  protein or HIV  Tat protein   
The choice of antagonist must primarily be made with safety in mind  but virus specific and cell specific differences in antagonist functions may potentially be exploited rationally when considering the overall combination 
For example  vaccinia virus E L is able to rescue VSV but not EMCV from exogenous IFN  whereas vaccinia virus K L partially rescued EMCV but not VSV   In anticipation of systematic  perhaps bioinformatically guided   super chimera  studies  two or more viruses that may complement each other s shortcomings in antiviral defense antagonism have been considered 
Notably  vaccinia virus was favorably combined with IFN I sensitive oncolytic VSV and SFV  yielding tumor model dependent increases in overall therapy efficacy that were dependent on vaccinia virus antagonism of type I IFN responses  which increased the replication of the IFN sensitive viruses   
Such heterologous virotherapy approaches may also be used to generate immunological synergy  similar to heterologous prime boost vaccination  anti tumor immune responses may be increased due to targeting of the tumor by two different viruses  on two separate occasions  but anti virus immune responses would be generated against different viruses each time  avoiding the problem of neutralizing immunity to and predominance of antivirus immune responses   
Some other ideas explored experimentally include engineering oncolytic viruses to express other oncolytic viruses 
For example  the entire oncolytic parvovirus H  genome was placed under a regulatable promoter in oncolytic adenovirus  resulting in a more effective therapeutic entity than either virus alone without loss of tumor specificity   
The genetic material of Semliki Forest virus replicons has been engineered into adenovirus and vaccinia virus backbones   and several other virus chimeras have been constructed   
However  the effects on tumor antiviral defenses of such a constructs remain to be studied The attribute  oncolytic  implies for a virus that it infects and  indeed  lyses the infected tumor 
This property is primarily tested in vitro in cultured tumor cells 
We have learned  however  that in the native tumor microenvironment in living hosts many viruses are no longer able to infect tumor cells or to kill them even if they manage to infect them 
Tightly packed tumor cells and the network of supportive molecules of the extracellular matrix form a physical barrier to virus particle diffusion 
It has also become evident that the tumor cells themselves may be much more capable of thwarting oncolytic virus advances than previously thought  with some tumor cells residing in a seemingly permanent non permissive antiviral state 
Tumors harbor multiple cell types in addition to the neoplastic cells  which may promote and propagate both physical and cellular virus resistance 
As the efficacy of virotherapy in human cancer patients still falls shy of the achievements in animal models  it appears quite plausible that one or more of the barriers described in this review indeed constitute a real and formidable obstacle for oncolytic virus advancement into routine clinical use 
Fortunately  some of the most difficult barriers have been identified  and a rapidly expanding arsenal of countermeasures is at our disposal 
Our task is now to separate the wheat from the chaff and to systematically evaluate the proposed combination regimens that will yield the best results without compromising patient safety Evidence of prenatal toxicity of herbal based indigenous formulations for sex selection in rat modelsTraditional or indigenous preparations  IPs  are getting considerable attention in global health debates  It continues to be used widely in several countries and its consumption is rapidly increasing 
 
  Many reports have documented the use of such preparations 
For instance  in China  traditional herbal medicines played a critical role during the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome  SARS  In fact  many drugs in modern medicine had their roots in the traditional system of medicine 
Drugs like Penicillin  from Penicillium fungi  and Digoxin  from Digitalis purpurea  are some such examples 
One of the promising therapies for Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus  MRSA  infection is a ninth century treatment for eye infections which is a recipe consisting of garlic and onions  wine  and bile from a cow s stomach brewed in a brass cauldron 
It is however important to note that culture specific practices are not always safe 
Digitalis is a classic example where herbalists use this plant in allopathic treatment strategies  while in some countries such as Britain  law restricts their vast availability  A report from Australia describes the adverse effects of ‘herbal  preparations or IPs  Problems arise when people do not report about the consumption of such preparations assuming that these are devoid of any side effects by virtue of them being natural products  The need for research in this field is huge and scientific research into the quality  safety  molecular effects and clinical efficacy is crucial 
 
 
Pregnancy is considered a time of minimal intervention  and a period when herbal medicines are usually contraindicated  It is reported that many women consume indigenous medicines  that contains Bryonia laciniosa  Quercus infectoria and Putranjiva roxburghii along with other ingredients  during early pregnancy to beget a male child in India 
These preparations  often called sex selection drugs  SSD  contain herbal ingredients but these are off the label prescriptions and hence cannot be certified as ‘herbal  medicines 
The prevalence of consumption varies from   to as high as         Studies have indicated that there is  –  times higher risk of birth defects including major malformations of internal organs like urogenital and renal malformation  trachea esophageal fistula  and visible defects like spina bifida  cleft lip palate and imperforate anus 
 
  Risk of stillbirths also increases   folds 
Studies suggest that a single exposure during pregnancy can be deleterious 
 
 
 
  SSDs are reported to contain phytoestrogens  steroids and heavy metals 
 
 
 
  It is also known that although placenta serves as a barrier  most drugs and environmental chemicals enter the foetal circulation by passive diffusion or active transport  However  despite growing evidence on deleterious effects of these herbal formulations  few studies have attempted to systematically understand the risk of such preparations using animal models 
Genetic sex of a child is determined at the time of conception by the fertilization of the ovum with X or Y sperms and intake of so called preparations for sex selection can never alter that In view of these  the current study was conducted with an objective to determine the embryo foetal and development toxicity of SSDs following maternal exposure during critical period of organogenesis using a small animal model The study was guided by the OECD guidelines for testing of chemicals  Guideline no    adopted on  nd January   Prenatal Developmental Toxicity Study  and was based on a mutually approved protocol 
Personal protection equipment was employed as required while handling the test system The test facility is registered and renewed  No 
 PO RcBi S CPCSEA dated July     for breeding and to conduct research on animals for commercial purpose by the committee for the purpose of control and supervision of experiments on animals  CPCSEA  Ministry of Environment  Forests and Climate Change  Government of India 
The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee  Venus Medicine Research Center 
Due permission was taken from the Ethics Committee of Indian Institute of Public Health Delhi For this experiment  strain of Sprague Dawley of rats  Rattus norvegicus  was used 
The number of dams per group was   instead of   as laid down under OECD guidelines 
Rats of both sexes  –  g  were obtained from National Institute of Biologicals  India at  –  weeks of age  acclimatized for five days and then subjected to the experiment at  –  weeks of age 
They were housed in standard polypropylene rat cages with stainless steel top grill  one dam per cage  at a temperature of       °C  with  –  relative humidity 
Bedding material and cages were changed once in six days and   hourly light dark cycle was followed 
Animals were identified by their existing ear numbering 
Cages were labelled by tags indicating the study number  sex  group of the animals  experimental start and completion dates 
Standard pelleted feed  from Ashirwad Industries  Mohali  India  was provided ad libitum to all the animals 
They also had free access to purified water via drinking bottles throughout the study 
The feed  cages and drinking bottles were not analysed for the presence of phytoestrogens and bisphenol A 
However  similar materials were used for all the rats across all groups The drug comprised of IPs for sex selection  SSD 
These non branded locally made preparations are made available  –  days after placing an order and are never sold openly 
These preparations essentially contain herbal ingredients such as Shivlingi  Bryonia laciniosa  Majuphal  Quercus infectoria  Putrajeevak  Putranjiva roxburghii  Nagkesar  Mesua ferrea  and feather of peacock  Pavo cristatus 
A total of   such samples of SSDs were procured from varied sources like ‘pansari  shop owners  grocers  local alternative medicine practitioners  rickshaw pullers  drivers and commoners from different states 
SSDs are advised to be consumed between   and   weeks of pregnancy The samples were categorized into   groups based on redundancy of the preparations and common ingredients reported 
This was followed by chemical analysis in an accredited laboratory to detect the presence of phytoestrogens and steroids 
Since we explored the toxic effects of these preparations we wanted to select two samples that would be most predictive of toxicity 
Due to resource constraints  we did not want to subject all the   samples for animal study 
Hence  three samples of SSDs  found to be most rich in phenols and steroids were selected for toxicity study  All the three samples were also tested for heavy metals which suggested that Lead and Mercury were in very high quantities  The toxicity was examined using C  elegans  an alternate animal model 
Survival analysis and reproductive toxicity was assessed from the brood size and progeny count assay  The two SSDs that were found to be most toxic were selected as test items for the subsequent study in rat models 
SSD   was reported to contain Shivlingi and Putrajeevak while SSD   contained Shivlingi  Majuphal  Putrajeevak  Nagkesar and feathers of peacock 
Both the samples were obtained from grocers 
Local preparations like these are bound to have certain degree of variability in concentrations but more often than not  these remain the major ingredients According to studies reported  women consume such preparations along with cow s milk in dosages and schedule that are quite varied 
While some advise these IPs to be consumed for one day  others prescribe it for   days  to be taken thrice a day 
We considered the amount of SSDs most commonly reported by pregnant women  weighing   kg  which was  –  g daily for   days 
The dose of the test item   mg kg  was calculated by using conversion factor of  Conversion factor is the ratio of the correction factors  estimated by dividing the average body weight in kgs of species by the body surface area in m  of the species  Km 
Human equivalent dose  HED in mg kg    Animal dose  mg kg  X correction factor  Km animal Km human 
Kms of every species are constant 
For humans it is    assuming average weight of adults to be   kg a surface area of   m  and for rats it is  Therefore  HED   mg  kg    animal dose X  
Or  animal dose         mg kg           mg kg Since pregnant women consume these orally  these were administered to rats by oral route The test items were coded as SSD   and SSD   and were provided to the experimental laboratory  Venus Medicine Research Center  Baddi  in powder form 
On the day of dosing  the doses were administered between  –  h  The test items were administered in fresh cow s milk at a final volume of   ml kg 
The doses were calculated on the basis of the latest body weight recorded for the study 
A stainless steel gavage cannula fitted to a calibrated syringe was used for dosing the animals For control animals  cow s milk was used as a vehicle while feeding The study was performed in two phases to evaluate the effect of SSD consumption duration during gestation period Adult  nulliparous female rats were mated with males of same species and strain in  
Each morning  dams were examined for the presence of a vaginal plug and vaginal smear was taken from each dam by using pipette smear technique 
The day of vaginal plug formation or sperms observed in vaginal smear  also known as successful mating  were considered as GD   Gestation day  
The mated females were housed individually in clear polycarbonate cages with stainless steel wire lids 
Mating process was carried out to result in   pregnant animals per group 
Successfully mated females were randomized into control and treatment groups 
All the rats were sacrificed on GD  
According to OECD guidelines  the test chemical should be administered daily from implantation to the day prior to scheduled caesarean section in order to assess toxicity 
Test chemicals were administered to pregnant animals and sacrificed as per the schedule  which was as close as possible to the normal day of delivery without risking loss of data resulting from early delivery i e GD  
The females were killed  before caesarean section  the uterine contents were examined  and the fetuses were evaluated for soft tissue and skeletal changes The pregnant rats were randomized to two intervention and one control groups 
SSD was given during pre implantation to implantation stage  GD  – 
Each group of rats was treated either with vehicle  G  VC  SSD   G    mg kg  or SSD   G    mg kg SSDs were given from GD  – 
Each group of rats was treated with either vehicle or SSD  or SSD 
Allocation of animals was randomized to the following groups  G   Control  VC  G   SSD    mg kg  G   SSD    mg kg  G   SSD    mg kg  G   SSD    mg kg  G SSD    mg kg  G   SSD    mg kg The following parameters were observed •Clinical Signs  Animals were observed once after successful mating or on GD  and after administration of the first dose 
Cage side observations for clinical signs of toxicity in the animals were recorded once daily until the day before necropsy •Body weight  Body weight of all experimental animals were recorded once before mating  initial body weight  and then after confirmation of mating 
Body weights were recorded on days               and on terminal day before sacrifice 
These recorded body weights were used for calculating the dose volume to be administered •Food consumption  Food consumption was evaluated once after successful mating or on day   of gestation  the day of vaginal plug formation or sperms observed in vaginal smear  and on days             and one day prior to sacrifice 
Calculated amount of feed were placed in the trough of each cage and the quantity of feed remaining after approximately   h were weighed and recorded •Morbidity Mortality  All the animals were observed twice daily  once in the morning between   and   h and once in the evening between   and   h  for incidence of morbidity and or mortality •Maternal examination related parameters  At the end of the observation period  all the dams were sequentially euthanized  by CO  asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation  and subjected to gross necropsy 
After termination  dams were examined macroscopically for any structural abnormalities or pathological changes 
Blinding was done while evaluation of the dams during caesarean section and subsequent foetal analyses to minimize bias 
Pregnancy rate was calculated as the proportion of mated pairs that had produced at least one pregnancy within a fixed period where pregnancy was determined by the earliest available evidence that fertilization has occurred 
Gestation index was calculated to indicate number of females with live born as a proportion of number of females with evidence of pregnancy •Examination of uterine contents  Immediately after termination  the uteri were removed and the pregnancy status of the animals ascertained 
Gravid uteri including the cervix were weighed  and number of corpora lutea were determined 
The uterine contents were examined for numbers of embryonic or foetal deaths and live foetuses 
The degree of resorption was described in order to estimate the relative time of death of the conceptus 
Any increase in the number of resorption and or implantation loss is an indicator of litter size for the individual dam •Examination of foetuses  The sex and weight of each foetus were determined 
Approximately one half of each litter were prepared and examined for skeletal alterations from selected dams 
The remainder were prepared and examined for soft tissue alterations  using accepted or appropriate serial sectioning methods or careful gross dissection techniques 
Each foetus was examined for external alterations 
Foetuses were examined for skeletal alterations  using Alizarin Red S staining method 
The fetuses for skeletal staining were kept in pre labelled plastic containers containing   ethanol before staining 
After skinning  we processed the foetus for staining by immersing in   alcian blue   GX for three days  then performed rehydration through a gradient series of ethanol   ethanol   –  h twice    ethanol   –  h  ethanol   –  h  distilled water until the samples sank to the bottom of a conical tube 
Samples were further treated with   KOH for  –  days or until it became clear and again treated with   alizarin red for next  –  days until bones became purple 
Samples were rinsed   times in   KOH  for  –  h at each time point 
Samples were further treated with a gradient series of glycerol  KOH    h   glycerol   h X  Visceral examination was done by micro dissection technique 
Fetuses were preserved in   formalin until they became fixed 
An illuminated magnifier was used for visceral examination 
We placed the foetus in a supine position on a paraffin wax block tray covered with paraffin wax  secured the fetal limbs by paper pins to the paraffin wax block  made a ventral midline incision from the umbilicus  cutting caudally to the genital tubercle and cranially to the diaphragm 
Once incision was completed  we located the ventral attachment of the diaphragm and lifted the liver carefully to examine the diaphragm for abnormal opening 
After observation  the diaphragm was clipped 
We gave a longitudinal cut to open the rib cage slightly lateral to and on the right of the sternebrae and then extended the cut anteriorly to neck region 
The rib cage was opened gently and secured to the paraffin block petridish tray with pins Foetuses were examined for soft tissue alterations  e g 
variations and malformations or anomalies  using Wilson s Technique 
The fetal viscera were examined sequentially  beginning with thoracic organs and moving caudally 
We performed hearts cuts after completion of other observations 
We examined the bilobed thymus for size  shape  coloration and presence of haemorrhages and then removed it for observation of trachea and esophagus 
We observed the lungs for size  color and number of lobes  observed the trachea  esophagus for normal alignment and presence of fistula  opened the pericardial sac and cut off pericardium to expose the heart for observation 
We checked the size  shape  color of the heart and normal development of major blood vessels 
After observation of thoracic viscera  we observed the abdominal viscera and liver for size  shape  color  texture  and number of lobes 
External anatomy of heart was examined by making two incisions using micro dissecting scissors We examined the stomach  spleen  pancreas  small and large intestines for size  position or any other developmental anomalies 
The intestines were moved aside after observation for seeing the underlying structures 
Ureters were checked for normal size and location and for continuity from the renal hilus to the urinary bladder 
One kidney was cut transversely and another was longitudinally to examine renal papilla and renal pelvis 
To confirm the sex of the foetus  the gonads were inspected carefully 
We examined the reproductive organs for size  shape and location GraphPad Prism® statistical software version   was used to analyze the data and all the results were represented as mean   S E M 
Intergroup variance for most of the parameters was calculated by one way analysis of variance  ANOVA  followed by Tukey s test 
A value of p     was regarded statistically significant 
Linear regression was performed to examine the weight change of dams during pregnancy for each group comparing with the control after adjusting for the litter size 
The malformations were analysed by performing Chi square test for trend for two groups  SSD  G  G  G  G  and SSD  G  G  G  G The ARRIVE guidelines were followed to report the findings 
In phase   pre natal study  all the dams dosed with SSD  and SSD  had normal food intake and weight gain 
The average gain in weight from GD  to GD   was       gms for controls while it was       gms in SSD   and       gms in SSD 
 Webtable  
No test item related mortality or clinical sign of toxicity was encountered during the study 
All dams in treatment groups and control group survived to scheduled terminal sacrifice 
They showed normal behaviour until euthanized 
There were no differences in mean maternal body weights  body weight gains  pregnancy rate  gestational index  pre and post implantation loss  and resorptions 
No significant differences were observed in foetal sex ratio  foetal body weights 
However  one dam from SSD  had all male foetuses 
No abnormality was detected in skeletal and visceral examination In phase   controls and SSD  and SSD  treated dams exhibited a comparable food intake  Table  
 
However  a dose response relationship was observed with reduced weight gain with higher doses of SSDs 
 Table  
 
Two dams  one in G   SSD    mg kg  and the other in G   SSD    mg kg  categories showed decreased or consistent body weight GD  onwards 
On an average  the weight on GD   was       gms in controls while it was       with SSD    mg kg  and       gms with SSD    mg kg 
The adjusted analysis indicated that except in G  there was a significant reduction in weight gain in all the intervention groups as compared to the control group after controlling for litter size  Table  
 During follow up  one dam from SSD    mg kg  and one from SSD    mg kg  showed haematuria during gestational day  – 
However  no another clinical sign of toxicity was encountered during the study 
All the dams in treatment and control groups showed normal behaviour and survived to scheduled terminal sacrifice 
In phase   pregnancy rate and gestational index were found to be   at all dose levels with SSD  whereas  in SSD  it decreased to   in G   SSD    mg kg  and G   SSD    mg kg  groups 
One dam from G   SSD    mg kg  and another one from G   SSD    mg kg  group showed mating confirmation during vaginal smear examination and showed positive sign in initial days of pregnancy but during necropsy on expected day of delivery  GD   no foetus was found 
Body weights of dams increased in the initial stages that became constant at a later period 
To reconfirm it  non gravid uterus was stained in salewski strain and presence of conceptus was found 
This indicated the possibility of miscarriage Increased pre and post implantation losses as well as resorptions and reduced live foetuses were observed with both SSD  and SSD 
No significant differences were observed in foetal sex ratio  but decreased foetal body weights were noted in both sexes 
On an average one early resorption in a group was a normal observation 
More than one late resorption was observed in all treatment groups while there was none in the control group 
Total count of live foetuses count was significantly reduced with SSD  and SSD  treatment in a dose dependent manner 
Total number of live foetuses were reduced up to   in SSD  at   mg kg treatment group and   in SSD  at   mg kg treatment group Both SSD  and SSD s at different dose levels showed decreased fetal weight in dose dependent manner  although the difference was not significant 
Skeletal and soft tissue alterations were observed in both treatment groups 
In general  the embryo–foetal examination showed abnormalities  which could have caused some functional damage to these foetuses if allowed to grow in the normal course 
In visceral examinations  slight dilation of the renal pelvis  reduced papilla size  urinary bladder hypertrophy was observed in few foetuses from both SSD  and SSD  treatment groups 
Few incidences of foetal soft tissue abnormalities encountered in this study were normal variants 
Skeletal examination showed variations in the ossification patterns like incomplete or poorly ossified skulls  ossification of sternebra  cleavage ossification of thoracic centrum  asymmetric thoracic centrum  and supernumerary rib in many foetuses in SSD  and SSD  groups  Table  
 
A trend was noted with increased incidence of certain malformations with increasing dosages of SSDs that was statistically significant for most malformations with SSD The results of this developmental toxicity study suggest that administration of SSDs to pregnant rats had significant impact on intrauterine foetal growth  early and late resorption as well as developmental anomalies 
These formulations have teratogenic potential but does not affect sex ratio IPs contain phytoestrogens like diadzein and genistein  In vitro rat whole embryo culture assay  WEC  studies of genistein in rats have indicated fetotoxic and teratogenic potential at concentration of ≥  μg mL  However  in vivo  an oral  gavage  embryonic and fetal development pilot study could not demonstrate any teratogenic effect in the same study 
These findings are different from our study probably because we used SSDs containing natural herbal and non herbal ingredients unlike those studies where synthetic genistein was used 
In both the studies  decreased body weight was observed indicating slight maternal toxicity 
Food consumption was unaffected in our study which is contrary to what was reported 
In another study  pregnant rats exposed to oral isoflavones  diadzein and genistein in varying combinations  showed alterations in the number of live foetuses  lysed foetuses  number of resorption sites  and implantation sites while no clinical signs suggestive of maternal toxicity  seizures  tremors and salivation  that was observed similar to our study 
Maternal mass gain was significantly reduced in rats treated with   mg kg of isoflavones  Ratio of females to males in the litter of different groups was similar akin to our finding  These observations clearly nullify the claim that consumption of SDDs could alter the sex of the growing foetus 
An analysis done by the same authors earlier revealed that SSDs contain testosterone and steroids 
 
  The prenatal testosterone in pregnancy is known to affect sexual development adversely      The principles of reproductive biology state that the genetic sex of an individual is determined at the time of conception and can never be altered under any circumstances 
However  phenotypic sex of the growing foetus is likely to be influenced by the hormonal milieu of in utero environment 
Our analysis was confined to phenotypic sex only and hence it is difficult to state if any differences existed with reference to genetic and phenotypic sex 
This requires further inquiry Evidence on the effects of SSDs on humans should best be obtained from human beings 
The findings of the current study corroborate well with the evidence generated from observational studies in human beings      Presence of skeletal and visceral malformations could explain why stillbirths are likely to be more in women who consume SSDs 
The dosing of the test drugs was intended not only to examine the period of organogenesis solely but to assess effects from preimplantation  through the entire period of gestation to the day before caesarean section 
The results were based on observations of more than   female animals with implantation sites at necropsy that added to its strength 
Unnecessary handling of pregnant animals as well as any stressors from outside was avoided 
At least three dose levels and a concurrent vehicle control were used with dams randomly allocated to different treatment groups that support the validity of the results 
However  absence of   rats per group does not support it to be a fully OECD compliant study 
We did follow the principles of Good Laboratory Practices  GLP  but due to constraints of resources the study could not be conducted as a GLP compliant study  though this is optimal for academic interests There is a lack of systematic approach to assess the safety and effectiveness of herbal preparations 
Ingredients for herbal medicines are often drawn from different sources and are used in combination  which may exhibit variability in terms of species  growing conditions  and biologically active constituents 
To isolate each active ingredient from each herb and then to establish its toxicity is time consuming  resource intensive and not practical 
Moreover  drug approval process does not accommodate undifferentiated mixtures  Though important  it surpasses the herb herb interaction and the potentiating effect of one compound over another 
Therefore  in our study  we administered the herbal mixture to assess the effects 
Real time evaluations have yielded important observations for several herbal drugs especially related to pregnancy 
For instance  Wang et al 
  used mice model to evaluate the adverse pregnancy outcomes after maternal exposure to the herbal medicines  particularly during early pregnancy  The major events included maternal and perinatal mortality 
Maternal weight gain  embryo growth and post natal weight gain were significantly decreased 
Moreover  foetal resorption and skeletal malformations were increased  signifying potential toxicity of Chinese herbal medicines 
This is comparable to our findings To conclude  the results of this developmental toxicity study suggest that administration of SSD  and SSD  to pregnant rats exerted significant impact on intrauterine foetal growth and development without any effect on sex ratio when administered during the period of organogenesis 
The prenatal exposure of SSD  and SSD  at dosage level of   mg kg day and   mg kg day during gestational days  –  to female rats had demonstrable effect on maternal or embryo foetal toxicity and teratogenicity SBN and AG conceptualized the study  AS and DD developed the study protocol and conducted the experiment  analysed the data and interpreted the findings

It is therefore natural to expect that the distribution of amino acids  across all protein sequences  would appear to be fixed  given no mutations over a specific period of time 
Of the   naturally occurring amino acids  each seems to appear randomly located at a particular position within the sequence of a protein 
However  when the sequences of a group of proteins are compared to one another  specific patterns begin to emerge 
These patterns are commonly referred to as motifs and frequently produce similar structural elements and in many cases  similar functions between the proteins that contain them 
In recent years  significant efforts have been made to reduce sequences into discrete motifs  so that each can be linked to some specific biological function based on particular rules      
Databases that consist of identifiable amino acid motifs  such as PROSITE  Pratt and EMOTIF  have been constructed to allow researchers an easy classification of unknown proteins into families based on their common motifs               
All of these methods share one property  they depend on specific alignment algorithms  such as the basic local alignment search tool  BLAST or PSI BLAST  to perform the sequence comparison between diverse families of proteins being analyzed      
These methods have already led to a number of key discoveries and offer the promise of determining biologically meaningful information about function from a protein s primary sequence It is generally accepted that a strong correlation exists between a protein s amino acid sequence and its resulting structure and function         
Techniques that can quickly determine significant similarities between protein sequences are valuable in predicting an unknown protein s function within the cell 
Here we describe a procedure that  by computing the frequency of key amino acid pairs  can quickly classify large groups of proteins into functional groups 
In order to uncover any relevant amino acid strings  we have utilized statistical methods applicable to datasets with large fluctuations in the search of human protein sequences within both the Swiss Prot and Complete Human Genebank databases The goal of this manuscript is to demonstrate how these two residue motifs can be used to develop rapid methods for searching protein or genomic databases in order to locate potentially interesting or aberrant protein sequences 
As an example  we describe the distribution of select amino acid pairs within the genome of the Coronavirus  Tor  which is responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome  SARS    
We have examined additional sets  but the limited format of this paper precludes a large presentation of potential applications The set of all   naturally occurring  amino acids are described by their standard single letter representations  and are taken as the complete set contained within all protein sequences as shown below Zq A R N D C Q E G H I L K M F P S T W Y V Residues that are arranged in a certain order can be referred to as vectors and are represented symbolically as b n b b bn bj Zq The coordinates of each vector represent the amino acid symbols contained within any given protein  where n is the total length of the vector 
The collection of all vectors b n  in the proteome can therefore be denoted simply by Zq n The underlying structure of a protein sequence  which is the order of the amino acids  has unique and identifiable characteristics 
As an analogy  in written English  the letter q is almost always followed by u 
Also  the frequency of the word  and  is much higher than that of the related three letter strings   nad   nda   dan  and  dna  which are simply permutations of the same set of individual letters to construct a word with a different meaning 
Utilizing similar characteristics  we can intuitively scan for unique sequence vectors contained within any given protein 
We expand on these characteristics  by utilizing the concepts of affinity and order stability in Section  Using the entire Swiss Prot database  release number   as the basis for our calculations  we have constructed a probability table for the occurrence of the   naturally occurring amino acids  see Table  
    
In addition to the Swiss Prot database  we have also included data from Complete Human Genebank  NCBI Build Number   March    as a source for all characterized and hypothetical human protein sequences We use the symbol Ω to denote the Swiss Prot database  and the letter M to denote the number of proteins in the database  
Hence we can state that Ω As s M  where As a a as Ns  is the sth protein  ai with i Zq is the ith amino acid in the sequence  and Ns is the length of the protein sequence As 
For any vector b n  if there is a sequence As in Ω such that b n  is a segment of As  then we can say b n  occurs in Ω 
We can then use NΩ b n  to denote the total number of outcomes that b n  has occurred in Ω  and let NΩ n  be the total number of all vectors occurring in Ω with length n  Therefore p b n NΩ b n NΩ n is the probability that the vector b n  occurs in Ω 
We then introduce k p q b n log p b n q b n where p b n  and q b n  are any two probability distributions on Zq n  and b n  belongs to Zq n 
The quantity k p q b n  in Eq 
  is defined for any two probability distributions p b n  and q b n  on Zq n  where the distribution q arises from independent letter  i e  amino acid  probabilities 
Then  k p q b n  can be viewed as a random variable about b n  and its probability distribution is defined as follows F p q x PI k p q b n ⩽x b n k p q b n ⩽xp b n The expectation value μ p q  and variance σ p q  of p b n  are expressed mathematically as μ p q b n Zq n p b n k p q b n 
 σ p q b n Zq n p b n k p q b n μ p q  Hence we see that μ p q  is simply the Kullback–Leibler entropy   
As a consequence  μ p q  is always non negative and μ p q  if and only if p b n q b n 
As a result  the amino acid sequence of b n  can be represented by k p q b n In Eq 
  the probability distributions p  q in the k p q b n  have several possible values 
For example  if we let p be the probability of b n  and only change the value of q in k p q b n  we obtain the following expression q b n j np bj p b p b p bn Based on Eqs 
  and   the value of k p q b n  gives us the affinity for all amino acids within vector b n 
Here two situations are identified as especially interesting i When k p q b n  implies that among the amino acids in vector b n  there is an increased affinity 
That is  the vector b n  occurs more frequently than expected 
 ii When k p q b n  implies that among the amino acids in vector b n  there is a decreased affinity 
That is  the vector b n  occurs less frequently than expected In a similar approach to the condition described above  we may choose q b n p πn b n  where πn b n  is a permutation of b n  and πn denotes a permutation transform 
In this case  the order sensitivity of b n  can also be reflected by the value of k p q b n  and produces the following outcomes i when k p q b n  implies that b n  occurs much more often than πn b n ii when k p q b n  implies that πn b n  occurs much more often than b n In addition to the concepts of affinity and order sensitivity  we can also design other analysis techniques by choosing alternate representations of q b n 
Quantifying the terms k p q b n  we can represent vector frequency numerically 
In cases where k p q b n μ p q ⩾ σ p q  the corresponding vector b n  is called  positive  while in those cases where the opposite takes place  k p q b n μ p q ⩽ σ p q  the vector b n  is called  negative 
By judiciously choosing a   equal to   we obtained   two residue  positive pairs  and   two residue negative pairs  see Table  
  out of a total of   possibilities of amino acid pairs Using any one of the positive motifs from Table   we can develop a test method to detect changes in their distribution through any protein database 
If b b b  is  positive  then p b b μ σp b p b  where p ⋅  is the probability of the amino acids or vectors ⋅ in the database 
Since NΩ μ M Nμ p bj NΩ bj μ MNμ we have NΩ b μ M Nμ μ MNμ μ σp b NΩ b or NΩ b μ M Nμ μ MNμ μ σp b NΩ b and since μ M Nμ is very close to μ MNμfor Swiss Prot database we have NΩ b μ σp b NΩ b and NΩ b μ σp b NΩ b As a consequence of Eq 
  the detection of a deleterious mutation based on the increased appearance of an arbitrary string of these residues becomes possible 
For example  according to Table   CC is an attractive motif with   then NΩ CC μ σp C μ M Nμ μ MNμNΩ C ≈ μ σp C NΩ C Let Ns CC  and Ns C  be the number of CC and the number of C in the sth protein 
Then we have NΩ CC NΩ C  because μ σ  and p C  since NΩ CC s MNs CC NΩ C s MNs C Based upon the result that the CC pair represents a rare event  proteins satisfying Ns CC Ns C  as defined in Eq 
  suddenly become interesting 
We can therefore consider the number Ns CC  as an index to develop detection methods to test for the presence of a CC containing protein within a database 
Using this same reasoning  one can also use any other one of the remaining motifs in Table   to develop detection methods for additional proteins In an identical fashion to the previous example using the positive two residue motifs in Table   we can also use any of the  negative  two residue motifs to develop search methods 
For example  the CM pair is a  negative  two residue  word  with  
That is  p CM μ σp C p M 
Using identical arguments to those described in Section   we obtain NΩ CM NΩ M  and NΩ CM NΩ C 
Since both Ns M  and Ns C  are small numbers for fixed proteins  the overall number of CM pairs in most proteins should be close to zero 
Therefore  we can also use any of the remaining seven  negative  motifs in Table   to develop additional detection methods In contrast to the CC motif  the total number of proteins in the Swiss Prot database having more than one CM pair is quite small 
For example  among the   proteins contained within this database  the number of proteins such that Ns CM ⩾  is   and the number of proteins satisfying the condition Ns CM ⩾  is only  
For human proteins in Swiss Prot  the total number of proteins containing CM pairs is   and there are only   proteins that satisfy Ns CM ⩾   Table  
However  we would expect to find about   proteins having CM pairs in the Swiss Prot database  based upon the amino acid frequencies given in Table   which is greater than the number observed Cysteine rich proteins and the presence of CC pairs in proteins are both concepts that have been studied previously      
If we combine these two concepts and describe them in mathematical terms  we observe that the rates q Ns C Ns and q Ns CC Ns C  describe these two conditions  where Ns  Ns C  and Ns CC  are the numbers of all amino acids  cysteine  and CC  respectively 
We can then derive proteinsNs C Ns p C σ Ns CC Ns C p ξτ C ξτ C σ where σ  and σ  are the standard deviations about Ns C Nss Mand Ns CC Ns C s M respectively We have found the following computational results based on Swiss Prot database σ ≈ σ ≈ andp ξτ C ξτ C ⩾ p C For   we have a much simpler method to determine that a protein sequence is both C  and CC rich if proteinsNs C Ns ∩proteinsNs CC Ns C So  a much simpler method to test whether a protein is a both C  and CC rich for   isNumber of CC  Number of C Number of C  Length of protein Using this principle  we found a total of eight proteins that are both C  and CC rich within the Swiss Prot database For   there is an easier method to determine whether a protein sequence is both C  and CC rich if proteinsNs C Ns ∩proteinsNs CC Ns C So  a much simpler method to test whether a protein is both C  and CC rich for   is based on the inequalitiesNumber of CC  Number of C Number of C  Length of protein Using this principle  we can get a total of   proteins that are both C  and CC rich within the entire Swiss Prot database For   there is also an easier method to determine if a protein sequence is both C  and CC rich sequence when proteinsNs C Ns ∩proteinsNs CC Ns C So  a much simpler method to test whether a protein is both C  and CC rich for   is based on the inequalitiesNumber of CC  Number of C Number of C Length of protein Using this principle  we have identified a total of   proteins that are both C  and CC rich within the Swiss Prot database 
From these results  it becomes clear that there are many C rich proteins and many CC rich proteins that are not mutually inclusive 
The sets of both C  and CC rich proteins are only subsets of the set containing all C rich proteins or that containing all CC rich proteins Because the Swiss Prot database is somewhat biased to those proteins that are of interest to researchers  we have decided to examine a database that was  in essence  complete 
For this  we chose the human subset sequences contained within the Complete Human Genebank database 
This was the most complete and readily available source of human genetic sequences and should therefore provide us with an accurate representation of both CC and CM pair distributions 
We observed that the total number of CC pairs within the human subset of sequences contained in Genebank  a total of   proteins  was  
These pairs were contained within a total of   proteins  Table   a number that is substantially larger than the   we obtained from Swiss Prot data  Table  
Since the total number of amino acids in The Complete Human Genebank is   we can easily get the expected number of CC in Complete Human Genebank is   which is much less than this actual value  
The same also holds true for the CM pair  where we would expect to see   CM pairs  but actually observe    Table  
 
This result is surprising but true and shows that there are fundamental difference between the Human and other species in terms of the frequency of CC and CM pairs To create a single CM pair  it is obvious that one needs only a single C  If a protein sequence also contains a CC pair  the total number of cysteines available to create a CM pair has been reduced by a factor of  
Using the cutoff value of four CC pairs as statistically significant  we determined the probability of finding a CM pair within proteins that already contained a CC pair  Table  
Even though both CC and CM can occur in the same protein  the total number of proteins in Genebank that contain both CC and CM pairs is   and these pairs almost always occur at different locations in the sequence 
However  in some rare cases the second C within the CC pair is shared with the first C within the CM pair  giving us a new triplet CCM If we filter the set of proteins described above for redundant entries  we obtain a set of   unique proteins that contain the CCM triplet in the human proteome 
Using the probability distributions obtained from Swiss Prot  we obtained the probability of CCM as  
Since the total of all protein lengths in the Swiss Prot database is   there should be a total of   CCM triplets 
This value is almost identical to the predicted number of CCM of  
This result suggests that the CCM triplet at least in Swiss Prot occurs randomly 
However  we can also analyze the CCM probability using a different approach  putting q CCM p CC p M  into Eq 
 
If CCM occurs randomly  then we have p CCM p C p C p M  and since p CC μ σp C p C  we will get k p q CCM log p CCM q CCM log p C p CC ⩽ μ σ Based on Eq 
  it is clear that the presence of a CC pair strongly excludes M  Therefore  the probability of the CCM triplet should occur less frequently than that of CC or M individually We have obtained the following statistical results with regard to the total number of CC and CM pairs contained in the Swiss Prot database i The total number of these proteins satisfying Ns CC ⩾  is   and   of these are found in humans 
 ii The total number of human proteins in Ω that satisfy Ns CC ⩾  is  
 iii The total number of the proteins in Ω that satisfy Ns CM ⩾  is     of these are found in humans 
 iv The total number of human proteins in Ω that satisfy Ns CM ⩾  is only  
The genome of the SARS associated Coronavirus contains a total of   open reading frames  which code for six characterized and five uncharacterized proteins   
After examining the complete proteome the SARS associated Coronavirus we observed a statistically significant increase in the occurrence of the CC and CM pairs in the SARS associated Coronavirus  genome Of the   putative proteins  four contain either CC or CM pairs 
Two large poly proteins  GI  and GI  contain   CC and   CM pairs  as well as   CC and   CM pairs  respectively 
The putative spike glycoprotein  GI    contains   CC and   CM  while the small envelope protein  GI    contains only   CC pair 
The remaining   proteins  of which two have been identified as a nucleocapsid and matrix protein  contain no CC or CM pairs 
When compared to the occurrence of CC and CM pairs within all human proteins found in the Swiss Prot database  it becomes clear that there is an increased occurrence of these pairs within the SARS associated Coronavirus proteome It is clear that the frequency of CC and CM pairs is significantly higher in the SARS genome than it is in the human genome 
It is our hope that these unique two residue motifs could be used as a means of identifying a virus such as SARS 
While currently impossible to determine  one can see a possible clinical use for determining the frequency of CC or CM pairs in an individual 
If a person has been infected by SARS  we would expect the numbers of CC and CM pairs to be much higher than in a healthy individual 
If we were then able to develop a clinically feasible technique that could identify the CC or CM pair content in total cellular protein  without damaging the cell  it could be possible to implement a detection method simply by counting the numbers of CC or CM pairs in all proteins examined 
If the presence of increased CC or CM pairs was indicative of infection by SARS we could develop new drugs to inhibit the translation of proteins that contain these pairs within infected cells 
As a very specific example  this could be accomplished through the use of specific tRNA mimics that could block translating ribosome when these pairs appear at the P and A site simultaneously      
While tRNA mimics could normally be seen as non specific protein synthesis inhibitors  the lower frequency of the CC or CM motifs in host proteins as compared to the relatively high occurrence in viral protein provide a starting point for the analysis of treatments using methods such as these In this paper we have performed a detailed search of the Swiss Prot and Complete Human Genebank database in relation to the frequencies of each of the   natural amino acids and motifs made up of two residues 
This has provided us with a new insight into the distribution of proteins within these databases and the information that may be contained within a protein s primary amino acid sequence 
Our focus in this quest has been to examine specific pairs or triplets of residues and use probability theory to assess whether or not particular strings of residues occur more frequently than their probability would indicate 
By analyzing affinity and anti affinity  we developed a procedure to search out all two  and three residue clusters within these databases 
Through this technique  we can rapidly classify large groups of proteins into families based on the occurrence of these motifs 
Combining this concept with a specific knowledge of protein function  we propose novel ideas aimed at developing fast detection methods for specific diseases based on the unusually high occurrence of some of these motifs when compared with the expected probabilities 
A timely example of the application of this method is given  namely the analysis of the SARS virus 
This method will hopefully lead to the discovery of new diagnostic techniques and possible treatment of diseases  by recognizing the location of target domains in the expressed sequence Cell type specific expression of the putative SARS CoV  receptor ACE  in human heartsThe coronavirus disease    COVID  caused by SARS CoV  infections imposes a major threat for the world s healthcare systems and is leading to thousands of deaths 
Angiotensin converting enzyme    ACE  has been identified as a potential receptor for SARS coronavirus  and is also considered the main receptor for SARS CoV  SARS CoV  binds to ACE  via its glycosylated outer membrane spike proteins 
ACE  is highly expressed in the lung and heart  and is known for its vital role in the cardiovascular system –  Although SARS CoV  mainly invades alveolar epithelial cells  it can also cause myocardial injury  as assessed by increased troponin T and NT proBNP levels accompanying increased cardiovascular symptoms in COVID infected patients  It is unclear whether elevated biomarkers of cardiac injury  or long term effects on the cardiovascular system  are directly caused by viral infection of cardiac tissue or are secondary to hypoxia and systemic inflammation 
However  patients with underlying cardiovascular disease represent a significant proportion of the patients who may suffer from a severe course after COVID  infection  This situation may be aggravated by findings showing that ACE inhibitors  which are often used to treat cardiovascular diseases  augment the expression of the SARS CoV  receptor ACE  in lung cells  This is probably mediated by an effect on angiotensin II  which is known to reduce ACE  expression  Thus  ACE inhibition decreases angiotensin II  leading to an indirect up regulation of ACE  The effect of angiotensin II receptor blockers  ARBs  which primarily target the angiotensin receptor   is unclear 
One may speculate that ARBs indirectly reduce ACE  levels by augmenting free angiotensin II levels  which in turn is expected to down regulate ACE  via activating the angiotensin receptor  
However  the effect of the two different treatments on the expression of ACE  in the heart requires further investigation Therefore  we used single nuclei RNA sequencing to determine the expression of ACE and ACE  in the different cell types of the human heart 
Gene expression signatures were detected in cardiac tissues of five patients with aortic stenosis  AS  and two patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction  HFrEF   Figure  A  and compared with with samples of one healthy donor heart  age    years  male  that was not used for transplantation 
After single nuclei RNA sequencing  data were pooled  and unsupervised clustering was performed with a total of     nuclei 
We found   distinct clusters 
Using cell type specific gene markers  major cell types were annotated  including cardiomyocytes  six clusters  fibroblasts  one cluster  endothelial cells  three clusters  leucocytes  two clusters  pericytes  one cluster  and smooth muscle cells  one cluster   Figure  B–D 
ACE  was expressed in cardiomyocytes  Cluster   and   and mural cells  particularly pericytes  Cluster   and was detected at a lower expression level in fibroblasts  endothelial cell  and leucocytes  Figure  D 
Comparison of ACE  in a pooled analysis of nuclei of the different groups showed that ACE  was significantly elevated in cardiomyocytes of patients with heart disease compared with healthy controls  Figure  E 
ACE  was also slightly  but not significantly  increased in endothelial cells  and the expression was lower in fibroblasts of patients with heart disease compared with healthy controls  Figure  E 
Immunostaining confirmed an increased expression of ACE  in cardiomyocytes of patients with aortic stenosis  Figure  F 
In addition  ACE was augmented in cardiomyocytes of patients with AS and HFrEF  Figure  G 
Interestingly  cardiomyocytes of patients who were treated with ACE inhibitors showed a significantly higher ACE  expression compared with ARB treated patients  Figure  H 
Moreover  patients treated with ACE inhibitors had an imbalance of ACE to ACE  expression  with a more than four fold higher ACE ACE  ratio compared with healthy control cells  Figure  I In conclusion  these data provide novel insights into the cell type specific expression and regulation of ACE  in the heart 
Patients with varying heart disease aetiology show augmented expression of ACE  levels particularly in cardiomyocytes 
Treatment with ACE inhibitors tends to be associated with increased ACE  mRNA and unfavourable ACE ACE  ratios  which are believed to be a driver of cardiovascular pathologies  This study is limited by its small sample size and therefore is only hypothesis generating 
However  these novel data suggest that it will be important to monitor SARS CoV infected patients for cardiovascular complications and assess the impact of ARB ACE inhibitor therapy 
Conflict of interest  none declared New onset acute symptomatic seizure and risk factors in coronavirus disease   A retrospective multicenter studyIn December   pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus  later called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus    SARS‐CoV‐  was first reported in Wuhan  China 
On March     the World Health Organization  WHO  declared the syndrome caused by SARS‐CoV‐  infection  coronavirus disease    COVID‐  a pandemic 
According to a WHO Situation Report of April    
 
 there are   confirmed COVID‐  cases and   deaths globally 
COVID‐  affects people of all ages 
 
  
 
 and in severe cases  it may cause dyspnea  hypoxia  acute respiratory distress syndrome  and septic shock 
 
  
 

The current situation has raised concerns regarding whether people with epilepsy have a higher risk to be infected with COVID‐  and whether people would develop acute seizures during the course of COVID‐ 
The objective of this study is to clarify the incidence and the risk of acute symptomatic seizures during acute COVID‐  infections This retrospective multicenter study was approved by the ethics committee of West China Hospital  Sichuan University  approval   
The study was conducted in   officially designed hospitals in Hubei province  the epicenter of the COVID‐  epidemic in China  Sichuan province  and Chongqing municipality 
These hospitals included the East Branch of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University  West China Ward  Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital  and hospitals in Sichuan province designated by the government to treat COVID‐   see the list of hospitals in Appendix S People with COVID‐  who were discharged from or died in the participating hospitals between January   and February     were consecutively enrolled 
All cases were diagnosed according to the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for COVID‐   trial version  
 
 All those enrolled tested positive through nucleic acid detection 
Disease severity was classified as mild  moderate  severe  or critical according to the national guidelines  see Box   for classification criteria 
 
 For our study  we aggregated severe and critical cases into a single severe group  whereas mild and moderate cases were aggregated into a single milder group 
The clinical outcome at discharge was either cured or death Electronic medical records of all enrolled cases were reviewed by   neurologists using a standard case report form  Appendix S 
Data were extracted on demographic characteristics  medical history  complications  treatments  and presence of risk factors for seizures 
These risk factors were considered to be the following  acute cerebrovascular disease  traumatic brain injury  TBI  central nervous system  CNS  infection  shock  hypoxia  severe metabolic disturbance  based on criteria from the International League Against Epilepsy
 
  multiple‐organ dysfunction syndrome  sepsis  and exposure to drugs or toxic substances Continuous variables were presented as median  interquartile range  and categorical variables as n  All of   people discharged from or who died at participating hospitals were consecutively identified and enrolled 
Most were from Sichuan province  n     followed by Chongqing  n     and Hubei  n    Ten individuals died  giving case fatality rates of    n     in Hubei     n     in Chongqing  and    n     in Sichuan 
Of the   severe cases      received mechanical ventilation  and     were given sedatives 
Apart from the effect of sedatives  mental state was relatively normal in   people 
Eight were encephalopathic  one was obtunded  one was delirious  and six were comatose 
The diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus was not made in any of these cases based on clinical presentation  results of investigations  or response to therapy 
No routine or long‐term electroencephalogram  EEG  was recorded due to exposure concerns None in this cohort had a past history of epilepsy 
None had any seizures  including febrile seizures  or status epilepticus during hospitalization 
Seizurelike events were seen in two people  it was believed that this was the result of an acute stress reaction in one and hypocalcemia in the other The first was a  ‐year‐old woman who reported bilateral bodily spasms lasting for about   minute  with mouth deviation but no impairment of awareness 
She was evaluated neurologically and psychiatrically and was diagnosed with an acute anxiety disorder  which was treated with olanzapine  paroxetine  and diazepam The second case was a  ‐year‐old woman who displayed bilateral myoclonus in the limbs with no impairment in consciousness   hours after admission 
Although this was initially suspected to represent seizures  she was found to have an electrolyte disturbance including hyponatremia  hypokalemia  and hypocalcemia  and the myoclonus resolved with correction of the metabolic disturbances Eighty‐four   cases reported systemic or direct brain insults that increased their risk for acute symptomatic seizures  Table  
The most common risk factor was hypoxia 
No severe electrolyte disturbance was seen  but hypokalemia  n       hyponatremia  n       and hypocalcemia  n       were frequently seen in the cohort 
Urea  creatinine  and serum glucose levels were moderately altered in most of cases 
In two cases who had chronic kidney dysfunction  substantial increases in creatinine levels were noted 
Results of investigations are shown in Table  
One case with TBI had an epidural hematoma  cerebral contusion  and skull base fracture 
Five people with severe COVID‐  experienced septic shock 
Three other cases of shock had hypovolemia or cardiac problems 
Ninety‐four   were given antibiotics  moxifloxacin  n       piperacillin sulbactam sodium  n       and third‐generation cephalosporins  n       were most commonly used We found no new onset seizures or status epilepticus in a large cohort of people hospitalized during the acute phase of COVID   infection despite a substantial proportion having risk factors for acute symptomatic seizures 
This is useful information  given the prior lack of knowledge about seizure risk during the acute phase of infection No individual in this cohort had a history of epilepsy prior to hospital admission 
To date  there is not much information available on people with epilepsy during the COVID‐  crisis 
There is one report of epilepsy in a case COVID‐  from Wuhan 
 
 As information is limited  it is not possible to establish whether this was a patient who had a history of epilepsy or whether the patient presented acute seizures 
There is at this time little if any evidence indicating that people with epilepsy are at an increased risk of COVID‐  infection 
A major challenge for people with epilepsy in this outbreak is nonadherence with the prescribed antiseizure medication  which was seen during the in SARS endemic in  
 
 This indicates the need to ensure the availability of supplies of medications and to advocate patients  self‐management 
Possible strategies for coping could also include online consultations and telemedicine networks Although many neurological and systemic disorders regarded as potential triggers
 
 of acute symptomatic seizures were identified in this cohort  seizures and status were not seen 
Stroke is one such risk factor 
The risk of developing acute symptomatic seizures after stroke ranges from   to  
 
 Acute cerebrovascular disease is considered a major cause of seizure and status epilepticus 
An earlier study from Hubei
 
  
 
 also reported six people with COVID‐  who had acute cerebrovascular disease without seizure 
Infection of the CNS can also give rise to seizures 
Although there is limited evidence of the presence of the SARS‐CoV‐  in the cerebrospinal fluid  CSF  the co‐occurrence of tubercular meningitis
 
 had been reported  with no seizure or status observed 
To determine whether COVID‐  can cause direct CNS insults requires further follow‐up 
In the earlier outbreaks of another coronavirus  a generalized convulsion with a positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for SARS‐CoV in CSF was reported  which could have been a coincidence 
 

Disturbances of homeostasis may lead to acute symptomatic seizures 
Hypoxia  the most common complication in our cohort  may trigger anoxic encephalopathy  particularly in refractory hypoxia 
Electrolyte disturbances as seen in COVID‐  are considered to be potential causes of acute symptomatic seizure 
 
 The severity and speed of such disturbances may affect onset of seizures  so these parameters should be carefully monitored The cytokine storm syndromes
 
 behind severe infection may cause the production of inflammatory cytokines systemically  with the consequence of acute toxic encephalopathies 
Although sepsis is a common cause of encephalopathy in intensive care medicine 
 
 hypoxia appears far more often than sepsis in COVID‐ 
There was also a high rate of septic shock in the COVID‐  population  varying from  
 
 to   in earlier studies in Hubei 
 
  
 

Certain antibiotics have been associated with symptomatic seizure 
 
 Antibiotics were used in a large number of people in our cohort without problems  but the most used antibiotics in the cohort were of low or moderate risk 
Clinicians should keep this seizure risk in mind when prescribing antibiotics  especially for people with renal dysfunction 
 

Our study has several limitations 
First  as a cross‐sectional study  we only have data from the acute phase of the disease 
A follow‐up study is underway to evaluate longitudinal seizure outcomes 
Second  the retrospective study design meant that we could not collect data on all relevant variables  for example  EEG was not recorded  so subclinical seizures could have been missed 
As all health care costs of COVID‐  treatment are covered by the government  all those suspected of infection are screened 
This may assure the objectivity and reliability of study materials  and it will allow for a future follow‐up study Our analysis suggests that COVID‐  poses minimal risk for seizures during the acute illness  although a significant proportion of severely ill individuals have risk factors that may increase the propensity to experience seizures 
These risk factors should be promptly addressed to minimize the risk of developing seizures 
Prospective long‐term studies must be done to determine whether people who have suffered from COVID‐  have an increased risk for developing seizures or epilepsy in subsequent months or years as a consequence of their illness None of the authors has any conflict of interest to disclose 
We confirm that we have read the Journal s position on issues involved in ethical publication and affirm that this report is consistent with those guidelines Decreased prealbumin level is associated with increased risk of mortality in hospitalized elderly patients with COVID The coronavirus disease    COVID  epidemic is caused by an infection with a novel coronavirus  officially named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus    SARS COV 
The infection spread rapidly on all continents and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization 
As of April       documented cases were reported worldwide  and   patients had died 
As there are currently no specific treatments and medications against the new virus  it is crucial to identify risk factors of severe prognosis Older patients have poorer prognostic factors and are more likely to experience critical disease 
 
 
Based on recent statistical data of China  among patients who were   years and older  the mortality rate was   which was significantly higher than that of younger patients at  
The proportion of deaths over   years old accounts for   of the total deaths in the national wide  which implicates aged people are more vulnerable to the SARS CoV 
Till present there are rare reports in literature focusing on the risk factors for poor outcomes of the elderly patients with COVID Serum prealbumin  known as transthyretin  its levels may be lowered not only by malnutrition  but also by inflammation and aging 
 
 
Compared to albumin  prealbumin has a shorter half life  a more rapid rate of hepatic synthesis  and predictable catabolic rate  hence  it may be a more sensitive indicator 
However  whether prealbumin could be an independent predictor of mortality in hospitalized COVID  elderly patients needs to be further elucidated The present study aims to describe the clinical characteristics and to investigate whether the prealbumin can serve as a valuable predictor of in hospital mortality  which might provide evidence for the risk stratification in elderly and help to improve the clinical practice and reduce fatality We designed this study as a retrospective cohort study design 
The elderly patients with COVID  who were admitted to Tongji Hospital in Wuhan from January   to February     were consecutively included 
This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Tongji Hospital  Approval Number  TJ IRB  and was complied with the Declaration of Helsinki 
The data were anonymous and the study was observational  so the informed consent was not gathered 
A flow diagram illustrating patient selection was described in Figure  
 
Inclusion criteria included elderly patients  ≥   years old  diagnosed with COVID  infection 
A total of   participants have been obtained 
Patients having missing baseline or outcome data  died on admission or being transferred to other designated hospitals during hospitalization were excluded 
There were   patients were included in the final analyses Data collection of participants was performed using hospital electronic medical record system

The diagnostic criteria and all clinical procedures in this study followed  Diagnosis and Treatment of Pneumonia Caused by New Coronavirus  Trial version   to   promulgated by the National Health and Health Commission of China Summary statistics of baseline characteristics of all patients and stratification by prealbumin tertiles were expressed as frequency and proportion for categorical variables  mean   standard deviation  SD   Gaussian distribution  or median  range   Skewed distribution  for continuous variables  and as percentages for categorical variables 
The differences between groups were analyzed using the χ   categorical variables  One Way ANOVA test  normal distribution  or Kruskal Whallis H test  skewed distribution We examined the relationship of the prealbumin as categorized into tertiles with the outcomes of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation 
Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to evaluate these relationships  then unadjusted and adjusted odds ratio  ORs  and   confidence intervals  CIs  were calculated 
Model   is the minimally adjusted model with only sociodemographic variables adjusted

We calculated odds ratio  ORs  and   confidence intervals  CIs 
The highest tertile was the reference for prealbumin 
We performed test for linear trend by entering the median value of each category of prealbumin tertile as continuous variable to examine the possibility of nonlinearity To ensure the robustness of our results  we also performed stratified analyses with the prealbumin as a continuous variable for the overall population and stratified by gender  age  hypertension status and coronary heart disease status at baseline 
Generalized additive models were used to visually confirm the relationship between prealbumin as continuous variable and the risk of outcomes  all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation Modeling was performed with the statistical software packages R  http www R project org  The R Foundation  and EmpowerStats  http www empowerstats com  X Y Solutions  Inc  Boston  MA 
P values less than    two sided  were considered statistically significant In our study    cases were excluded 
To avoid selection bias due to missing data  we performed a sensitivity analysis 
The results showed that there was no statistical difference between missing group and non missing group  supplemental table  Of   elderly inpatients included in the final analysis  the mean age was     years  ranging from   years to   years  and most patients were male  table  
 
The baseline characteristics of these included participants were listed in table 
The day of sample drawing after admission was       day 
No significant statistical difference in sex  smoking status  body weight  BMI  comorbidity  hypertension  coronary heart disease  chronic kidney disease  cerebral vascular disease  carcinoma  chronic liver disease  symptoms  fever  cough  headache  diarrhea and myalgia fatigue at admission  were detected across different groups of prealbumin  tertile 
When compared with subjects in the highest tertile  those in the lowest tertile were older  more likely to have diabetes medical history  with higher Neutrophil count  lower lymphocyte count  worse coagulation function and liver function 
A total of     patients required mechanical ventilation      patients admitted to intensive care unit and     patients died during hospitalization 
The incidence of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation were significantly decreased across prealbumin tertiles  all cause death    vs    vs    for tertile   vs  tertile   vs  tertile   ICU admission    vs    vs    for tertile   vs  tertile   vs  tertile   mechanical ventilation    vs    vs    for tertile   vs  tertile   vs  tertile   respectively To investigate the correlation between prealbumin and in hospital outcomes  we constructed three models using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models  table  
 
In the unadjusted model  the ORs of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation was significantly increased as the prealbumin tertiles downgraded 
The OR for tertile   was significantly higher than the OR for tertile    OR       CI    to   P   for all cause death  OR       CI    to   P   for ICU admission  OR       CI    to   P   for mechanical ventilation 
Additional adjustment for the demographic variables and comorbidities did not reduce the ORs for the association between prealbumin tertiles and in hospital outcomes 
Further adjusting for the baseline levels of blood examinations  including blood routine  neutrophil  lymphocyte  neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio  coagulation function  prothrombin time  activated partial thromboplastin time  d dimer  liver fuction  alanine transaminase  aspartate aminotransferase  total bilirubin  renal function  blood urea nitrogen  creatinine  and infection indicators  C reactive protein  did not affect the relationships in the fully adjusted models  OR       CI    to   P   for all cause death  OR       CI    to   P   for ICU admission  OR       CI    to   P     for mechanical ventilation 
Therefore  lower tertile of prealbumin exhibited an increased risk of worse in hospital outcomes  full adjusted P for trend for all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation  P     P   and P     respectively Generalized additive models  Fig  
A through  C  were used to visually assess functional relationships between the prealbumin as continuous variate and the risk of in hospital outcomes 
Serum prealbumin was found to have negative linear relationship with the risk of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation To determine the consistency of the relationship between baseline prealbumin as a continuous variable and in hospital outcomes  we conducted stratified analyses  Table  
 
For each unit increase of prealbumin  the adjusted OR for all cause death was   in males  P     and   in females  P    
The adjusted OR for all cause death for persons less than   years of age was    P     compared with    p     for persons   years and older  P interaction    
For each unit increase of the prealbumin  the OR for all cause death was    P     and    P     for normotensives and hypertensives     P     and    P     for non diabetic and diabetes respectively 
The difference of interaction was not significant between two groups  P interaction         and   stratified for gender  age  hypertention and diabetes respectively 
Moreover  the relationship between baseline prealbumin with ICU admission and mechanical ventilation stratified by gender  age  hypertention and diabetes are consistent In this study  we found that lower serum prealbumin significantly associated with an increased risk of worse outcomes and all cause death during hospitalization 
Patients in the lowest tertile of prealbumin were older  and with higher Neutrophil count  lower lymphocyte count  worse coagulation function and liver function compared with subjects in the highest tertile 
Then we adjusted relevant covariates including age  sex  smoking status  comorbidities  neutrophil  lymphocyte  coagulation function  liver function  renal function and C reactive protein to minimize the potential impact of confounding 
Compared with crude regression analyses  this association still persisted when adjusting for demographic and clinical variables in the multivariable regression analyses 
Moreover  stratified by gender  age  hypertension and diabetes  increased level of serum prealbumin was associated with the decreased risk of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation  which determine the consistency of the relationship between lowest serum prealbumin tertile and the increased risk of worse outcomes in elderly COVID  patients Several previous studies have demonstrated baseline prealbumin change in COVID  patients 
Decreased level of prealbumin was observed among COVID  patients 
Wu C et al investigated   patients with COVID  and observed that prealbumin was associated with the development of ARDS  indicating the potential value of prealbumin level on COVID  clinical ending 
Till date  no report exists on the effect of prealbumin in COVID  elderly patients High proportion of severe to critical cases and high fatality rate were observed in the elderlyCOVID  patients  and rapid disease progress was noted in the dead 
One possible explanation involves the greater potential of seniors to be in a state of inflammation  nutritional deficiency and other complications 
Prealbumin is a globular  non glycosilated protein  synthesized by the liver  and complexed with a retinol binding protein  which acts as a transporter of retinol vitamin A and thyroid hormones 
Low plasma prealbumin level has far back emerged as an earliest laboratory indicator of poor nutritional status 
 
 
In addition  prealbumin are also associated with inflammation 
Previous studies showed that in response to the inflammation  the body responds by synthesizing a large number of cytokines 
These include interleukins and tumor necrosis factors that down regulate  decrease  plasma concentrations of albumin and prealbumin 
 
 
Therefore  assay of serum prealbumin concentration is recommended by some investigators as a screening marker for both malnutrition and inflammation Elderly with low plasma prealbumin levels mean that those people are at greater risk of malnutrition and inflammatory conditions  which may lead to poor prognosis 
Malnutrition is commonly seen in hospitalized patients in both the developed and developing world  especially among elderly patients 
A review of   published studies of acute care patients reported that malnutrition incidence ranged from  –  of hospitalized elderly 
It was found that compared to non famine regions of India  experiencing famine had significantly higher influenza mortality rates during the   Influenza pandemic 
Aging  frailty  and chronic diseases are associated with impaired immune function and are compounded by immune dysregulation from malnutrition 
When immune response is dysregulated  it would result in an excessive inflammation  even death 
In the current COVID  study  it was found that elderly patients have higher levels of white blood cells counts  CRP  inflammatory cytokines and are more likely to experience critical disease than did those younger patients 
 
 This retrospective cohort study included   elderly COVID  patients  until the date of February       of patients required mechanical ventilation    of patients admitted to intensive care unit  and the total in hospital mortality was  
The mortality rate was lower than that reported by wang L et al  among elderly COVID  patients 
This may have been the reason for some patients at the date of February     are still in hospital 
Nevertheless  this would not bias the relationship between prealbumin and in hospital outcomes because of the definite observation time we set previously 
Moreover  Wuhan tongji Hospital as one of the largest third grade Class A hospitals equipped with advanced life support training and equipment may partly account for the moderate mortality The results of this study have several clinical implications and strengths 
A low prealbumin concentration can therefore be regarded primarily as a signal identifying the at risk elderly patient who would suffer worse outcomes and requires careful assessment and monitoring for whom nutritional support and Inflammation detection may be needed as part of the treatment plan 
As observational study was susceptible to various confounders  we adjusted many variables that may affect the relationship between prealbumin and in hospital outcomes to minimize potential confounding 
In addition  we tested the robustness of the results by repeating the analyses in different subgroups of gender  age  history of hypertension and history of diabetes Our study has some limitations 
First  by including patients still in hospital as of J February     the case fatality ratio in our study cannot reflect the true mortality of elderly COVID 
Second  the record of data may be affected by prehospital medication and the time interval between admission and onset 
Third  since all subjects in our study were hospitalized Chinese elderly patients diagnosed with COVID  results of this study might not directly be applied to other ethnicities and age groups In conclusion  this retrospective cohort study revealed that the prealbumin is an independent risk factor for the in hospital mortality in the Chinese COVID  elderly patients 
Nutritional support and Inflammation detection should be careful assessment and monitoring for the elderly patients with low prealbumin concentration

All the authors confirm that there is no Plagiarism or self plagiarism and fabrication of data Recombination Every Day  Abundant Recombination in a Virus during a Single Multi Cellular Host InfectionAs increasing numbers of full length viral sequences become available  recombinant or mosaic viruses are being recognized more frequently   
Recombination events have been demonstrated to be associated with viruses expanding their host range   or increasing their virulence    thus accompanying  or perhaps even being at the origin of  major changes during virus adaptation 
It remains unclear  however  whether recombination events represent a highly frequent and significant phenomenon in the everyday life of these viruses Viruses can exchange genetic material when at least two different viral genomes co infect the same host cell 
Progeny can then become hybrid through different mechanisms  such as reassortment of segments when the parental genomes are fragmented    intra molecular recombination when polymerases switch templates  in RNA viruses     or homologous or non homologous recombination  in both RNA and DNA viruses 
Quantification of viral recombination in multi cellular organisms has been attempted under two distinct experimental approaches  in vitro  in cell cultures     and in vivo  in live hosts    
The in vitro approach  which has so far been applied only to animal viruses  allows the establishment of the  intrinsic  recombination rate in experimentally co infected cells in cell cultures   
However  it does not necessarily reflect the situation in entire  living hosts  where the frequency of co infected cells is poorly known and depends on many factors such as the size of the pathogen population  the relative frequency and distribution of the different variants  and host defense mechanisms preventing secondary infection of cells 
The in vivo experimental approach is closer to biological conditions and may thus be more informative of what actually happens in  the real world However  as discussed below  numerous experimental constraints have so far precluded an actual quantification of the baseline rate of recombination 
First  many experimental designs have used extreme positive selection  where only recombinant genomes were viable  e g    
Other studies did not use complementation techniques but detected recombinants by PCR within infected hosts or tissues    which provides information on their presence but not on their frequency in the viral population 
So far  no quantitative PCR or other quantitative method has been applied to evaluate the number of recombinants appearing in an experimentally infected live host 
Finally  recent methods based on sequence analysis inferred the population recombination rate  rather than the individual recombination rate   
While results from these methods certainly take in vivo recombination into account  there are other caveats  isolates have often been collected in different hosts sometimes in different geographical regions and sometimes the selective neutrality of sequence variation on which these estimates are based is not clearly established 
Estimates from such studies by essence address the estimation of the recombination rate at a different evolutionary scale Taken together  the currently available information indicates that no viral recombination rate has ever been estimated directly at time and space scales corresponding to a single multi cellular host infection  although this level is most significant for the biology and evolution of viruses 
This study intends to fill this gap by evaluating the recombination frequency of the cauliflower mosaic virus  CaMV  during a single passage in one of its host plants  the turnip Brassica rapa CaMV is a pararetrovirus  which is a major grouping containing hepadnaviruses  e g  hepatitis B virus  badnaviruses  e g  banana streak virus  and caulimoviruses  e g  CaMV 
Pararetroviruses are characterized by a non segmented double stranded DNA genome 
After entering the host cell nucleus  the viral DNA accumulates as a minichromosome   whose transcription is ensured by the host RNA polymerase II   
The CaMV genome consists in approximately   bp and encodes six viral gene products that have been detected in planta  Figure     
Viral proteins P  to P  are expressed from two major transcripts  namely a  S RNA  encoding P  and a  S RNA corresponding to the entire genome and serving as mRNA for proteins P –P    
Using the pre genomic  S RNA as a matrix  the protein P   product of gene V  reverse transcribes the genome into genomic DNA that is concomitantly encapsidated   The detection of CaMV recombinants in turnip hosts has been reported numerous times 
Some studies have demonstrated the appearance of infectious recombinant viral genomes after inoculation  i  of a host plant with two infectious or non infectious parental clones   or  ii  of a transgenic plant containing one CaMV transgene with a CaMV genome missing the corresponding genomic region   
While the former revealed inter genomic viral recombination  the latter demonstrated that CaMV can also recombine with transgenes within the host s genome 
Another study based on phylogenetic analyses of various CaMV strains has clearly suggested different origins for different genomic regions and  hence  multiple recombination events during the evolution of this virus   
Indirect experimental evidence has indicated that  in some cases  CaMV recombination could occur within the host nucleus  between different viral minichromosomes  presumably through the action of the DNA repair cellular machinery   
Nevertheless  the mechanism of  template switching  during reverse transcription  predominant in all retroviruses  most certainly also applies to pararetroviruses 
For this reason  and on the basis of numerous experimental data  CaMV is generally believed to recombine mostly in the cytoplasm of the host cell  by  legal  template switching between two pre genomic RNA molecules    or  illegal  template switching between the  S and the  S RNA   
Under this hypothesis  recombination in CaMV could therefore be considered as operating on a linear template during reverse transcription  with the  ′ and  ′ extremities later ligated to circularize the genomic DNA  position   in Figure  
The above cited studies clearly demonstrate that CaMV is able to recombine 
However  since these studies are based on complementation techniques  non quantitative detection  or phylogenetically based inferences of recombination  they do not inform us on whether recombination is an exceptional event or an  everyday  process shaping the genetic composition of CaMV populations In the present work  we aimed at answering this question 
To this end  we have constructed a CaMV genome with four genetic markers  demonstrated to be neutral in competition experiments 
By co inoculating host plants with equal amounts of wild type and marker containing CaMV particles  we have generated mixed populations in which impressive proportions of recombinants distributed in several different classes corresponding to exchange of different genomic regions have been detected and quantified 
Altogether  the recombinant genomes averaged over   of the population 
Further analysis of these data  assuming a number of viral replications during the infection period ranging from five to   indicates that the per nucleotide per replication cycle recombination rate of CaMV is of the same order of magnitude  i e  on the order of a few   across the entire genome 
We thereby provide the first quantification  to our knowledge  of the recombination rate in a virus population during a single passage in a single host From Figure   and supposing that all marker containing genomic regions can recombine  we could predict the detection and quantification of seven classes of recombinant genotypes   bcd a  a cd b  ab d c  abc d   cd ab  a d bc  and a c b d 
Indeed  all classes were detected  and their frequencies in the ten CaMV populations analyzed are summarized in Table  Altogether  the proportion of recombinant genomes found in the mixed viral populations was astonishingly high and very similar in the ten co infected plants analyzed  Table   last column  ranging between    plant   to    plants     and   with a mean frequency   standard error  of      
This result indicates that recombination events are very frequent during the invasion of the host plant by CaMV and represents  to our knowledge  the first direct quantification of viral recombination during the infection of a live multi cellular host The inferred per generation recombination and interference rates  assuming that CaMV undergoes ten replication cycles during the   d between infection and sampling  are given for each of the ten plants in Table  
Recombination rates between adjacent markers are large  on the order of   to  
Taking the distance in nucleotides between markers into account yields an average recombination rate per nucleotide and generation on the order of      
Interestingly  this recombination rate does not vary throughout the genome  Kruskal–Wallis test  p    To relax the assumption of the number of replications during the   d  we calculated the recombination parameters assuming five or   generations 
The effect of the number of generations on the estimates is linear  doubling the number of generations results in a halving of the recombination rate  detailed results not shown 
For example  the average recombination rates r
  r
  and r
  assuming   generations were equal to     and   respectively  compare with values in Table   yielding per nucleotide per generation recombination rates of             and      Inspection of Table   also shows that first order interference coefficients were in general negative  indicating that a crossing over in one genomic segment increases the probability that a crossing over will occur in another genomic segment  while the second order coefficient parameter had an average value close to zero with a large variance 
The mechanism leading to these results will be discussed in the following section One major breakthrough in the work presented here lies in the space and time scales at which the experiments were performed 
Indeed  the processes occurring within the course of a single infection of one multi cellular host are of obvious biological relevance for any disease 
Previous studies on viral recombination suffered from major drawbacks in this respect  basing their conclusions on experiments relying on complementation among non infectious viruses or between viruses with undetermined relative fitness  on phylogenetically based analyses  or on experiments in cell cultures 
For reasons detailed in the Introduction  the first two methods either do not provide information on the frequency of recombination  but only its occurrence  or address the question at a different temporal  and often spatial  scale 
Results from cell cultures  on the other hand  impose cell co infection by different viral variants  potentially overestimating the frequency of recombination events 
Our study circumvents these limitations by analyzing viral genotypes sampled from infected plants after the course of a single infection  and therefore the invasion and co infection of cells in various organs and tissues is very close to natural More than half of the genomes       see Table   present in a CaMV population after a single passage in its host plant were identified as recombinants  and these data allowed us to infer a per nucleotide per generation recombination rate on the order of       to      
The time length of one generation  i e  the time required for a given genome to go from one replication to the next  is totally unknown in plant viruses 
The only experimental data available on CaMV are based on the kinetics of gene expression in infected protoplasts  where the capsid protein is produced between   and   h   
The reverse transcription and the encapsidation of genomic DNA being two coupled phenomena    we judged it reasonable to assume a generation time of   d and  thus  an average of ten generations during our experiments 
In case this estimate is mistaken  we have verified a linear relationship between r and the number of generations  thereby allowing an immediate adjustment of r if the CaMV generation time is more precisely established 
At this point  we must consider that all cloned genomes may not have been through all the successive replication events potentially allowed by the timing of our experiments 
It was previously shown that about   of CaMV mature virus particles accumulate in compact inclusion bodies    where they may be sequestered for a long time  as such inclusions are very frequent in all infected cells  including those in leaves that have been invaded by the virus population for several weeks 
The viral population may thus present an age structure that could bias the estimation of the recombination rate 
In order to minimize this bias  the clones we analyzed were collected in one young newly formed leaf  where the chances of finding genomes from  unsequestered lines  were assumed to be higher 
In any case  our data analysis is conservative  since this age structure can only lead to an underestimation of the recombination rate Our results show that interferences between pairs of loci are negative  a recombination event between two loci apparently increases the probability of recombination between another pair of loci 
We believe that the most parsimonious explanation of these negative interferences is based on the way the infection builds up within plant hosts 
Indeed  one can divide infected host cells into those infected by a single virus genotype and those infected by more than one viral genotype 
In the former  analogous to clonal propagation  recombination is undetectable 
In the latter  recombination is not only detectable but  as our results indicate  very frequent 
Samples consisting of viruses resulting from a mixture of these two types of host cell infections will thus contain viruses with no recombination and viruses with several recombination events  thus yielding an impression of negative interference 
These conceptual arguments are supported by mathematical models 
It is indeed easy to show  detailed results not shown  that if a proportion F of the population reproduces clonally  analogous to single infections  while the remaining reproduces panmictically  negative interferences could be inferred even if they do not exist 
For example  assuming a three locus model with real recombination rates r
  and r
  and interference i
  the  apparent  recombination and interference parameters  would be r
        F r  r
        F r
  and i
     F   i
    F 
Interestingly  this example also shows that our estimates of the recombination rate are conservative  that a fraction F of host cells are singly infected while others are multiply infected leads to an underestimation of the recombination rate As judged by r
  r
  and r
  calculated between markers a–b  b–c  and c–d  respectively  we found evidence for recombination through the entire CaMV genome 
The values for r
 
r
  and r
  are remarkably similar  hence the recombination sites seem to be evenly distributed along the genome 
We considered the template switching model as the major way recombinants are created in CaMV 
As already mentioned in the Introduction  hot spots of template switching have been predicted at the position of the  ′ extremities of the  S and  S RNAs   
If other recombination mechanisms  such as that associated with second strand DNA synthesis or with the host cell DNA repair machinery  act significantly  hot spots would be expected at the positions of the sequence interruption     and     
Due to the design of our experiment and the position of the four markers  we have no information on putative hot spots at positions corresponding to the  ′ end of the  S RNA and to    at nucleotide position  
Nevertheless  the putative hot spots at the  ′ end of the  S RNA and at   and    nucleotide positions   and   respectively  fall between marker pairs c–d  b–c  and a–b  respectively 
Our results indicate that either these hot spots are quantitatively equivalent though predicted by different recombination mechanisms or  more likely  that they simply do not exist 
Whatever the explanation  what we observe is that the CaMV can exchange any portion of its genome  and thus any gene thereof  with an astonishingly high frequency during the course of a single host infection To our knowledge  the viral recombination rate has never previously been quantified experimentally for a plant virus   
In contrast  retroviruses and particularly HIV  have been extensively investigated in that sense 
As we have already discussed for these latter cases  the quantification of the intrinsic recombination rate was carried out in artificially co infected cell cultures 
The estimated intrinsic per nucleotide per generation recombination rate in HIV  is on the order of      less than one order of magnitude higher than our estimation for CaMV 
Because for various reasons detailed above we probably underestimate the within host CaMV recombination rate  we believe that the intrinsic recombination rate in CaMV is higher and perhaps on the order of that of HIV Other pararetroviruses such as plant badnaviruses or vertebrate hepadnaviruses have a similar cycle within their host cells  including steps of nuclear minichromosome  genomic size RNA synthesis  and reverse transcription and encapsidation 
Nevertheless  vertebrate hepadnaviruses  e g  hepatitis B virus  infect hosts that are very different from plants in their biology and physiology  and this could lead to a totally different frequency of cell co infection during the development of the virus populations 
Thus  even though our results can be informative for other pararetroviruses because of the viruses  shared biological characteristics  they should not be extrapolated to vertebrate pararetroviruses without caution We used the plasmid pCa  which is the complete genome of the CaMV isolate Cabb S  cloned into the pBR  plasmid at the unique SalI restriction site   
To analyze recombination in different regions of the genome  we introduced four genetic markers  a  b  c  and d  at the positions       and   respectively  thus approximately at four cardinal points of the CaMV circular double stranded DNA of   bp  Figure  
All markers  each corresponding to a single nucleotide change  were introduced by PCR directed mutagenesis in pCa  and resulted in the duplication of previously unique restriction sites BsiWI  PstI  MluI  and SacI in a plasmid designated pMark S  Because  in this study  we targeted the possible exchange of genes between viral genomes  all markers a  b  c  and d were introduced within coding regions corresponding to open reading frames I  IV  V  and VI  respectively 
Another important concern was to quantify recombination in the absence of selection  i e  to create neutral markers 
Consequently all markers consist of synonymous mutations  see below To generate the parental virus particles  plasmids pCa  and pMark S were mechanically inoculated into individual plants as previously described   
All plants were turnips  B  rapa cv   Just Right  grown under glasshouse conditions at   °C with a    light dark  photoperiod 
Thirty days post inoculation  all symptomatic leaves were harvested and viral particles were purified as described earlier   The resulting preparations of parental viruses  designated Cabb S and Mark S  were quantified by spectrometry using the formula described by Hull et al 
  
We fixed the initial frequency of markers to a value of   and a solution containing   mg ml of virus particles of both Cabb S and Mark S at a   ratio was prepared 
Plantlets were co infected by mechanical inoculation of two to three leaves with   μl of this virus solution  using abrasive Celite AFA  Fluka  Ronkonkoma  New York  United States 
The mixed CaMV population was allowed to grow during   d of systemic infection We designed an experimental protocol for quantifying marker frequency within a mixed Cabb S Mark S virus population after a single passage in a host plant 
Twenty four individual plants  inoculated as above with equal amounts of Cabb S and Mark S  were harvested   d post inoculation  when symptoms were fully developed 
The viral DNA was purified from   mg of young newly formed infected leaves according to the protocol described previously   
After the precipitation step of this protocol  the viral DNA was resuspended and further purified with the Wizard DNA clean up kit  Promega  Fitchburg  Wisconsin  United States  in TE  X   mM Tris HCl and   mM EDTA  pH   
Aliquots of viral DNA preparations were digested by restriction enzymes corresponding either to marker a  b  c  or d and submitted to a   agarose gel electrophoresis  colored by ethydium bromide and exposed to UV 
Each individual restriction enzyme cut once in Cabb S DNA and twice in Mark S  thus generating DNA fragments of different sizes attributable to one or the other in the mixed population of CaMV genomes 
After scanning the agarose gels  we estimated the relative frequency of the two genotypes in each viral DNA preparation and at each marker position  by densitometry using the NIH   Image program 
The statistical analyses of the frequency of the four markers are described below To identify and quantify the recombinants within the CaMV mixed populations  aliquots from ten of the   viral DNA preparations described above were digested by the restriction enzyme SalI  and directly cloned into pUC  at the corresponding site 
In each of the ten viral populations analyzed    full genome length clones were digested separately by BsiWI  PstI  MluI  and SacI  to test for the presence of marker a  b  c  and d  respectively 
In this experiment  with the marker representing an additional restriction site  we could easily distinguish between the Cabb S and the Mark S genotype at all four marker positions  upon agarose gel   electrophoresis of the digested clones 
Clones with none or all four markers were parental genotypes  whereas clones harboring     or   markers were clearly recombinants 
Due to the very high number of recombinants detected  markers eventually appearing or disappearing due to spontaneous mutations were neglected Here we present the different methods we used to quantify recombination in the CaMV genome 
Because all these methods assume that the different markers are neutral  we first discuss assumption We used two datasets to test the neutrality of markers  both resulting from plants co infected with a   ratio of Mark S and Cabb S 
The first consisted of viral DNA densitometry data derived from   plants  described above  where for each plant we have an estimate of the frequency of each marker in the genome population 
The second consisted of the restriction of   individual full genome length viral clones obtained from one co infected plant  described above  yielding an estimate of the frequency of each marker  and this was repeated on ten different plants 
The frequencies of the different markers were       and   for markers a  b  c  and d in the first dataset and       and   in the second dataset 
We tested whether these frequencies were significantly different from the expected value under neutrality    using either t tests  for datasets where normality could not be rejected  seven out of eight cases  or Wilcoxon signed rank non parametric tests otherwise  marker c in the first dataset 
In all cases p values were larger than  There are several cautionary remarks regarding these analyses 
First  in all cases we found an excess of markers 
Unfortunately  the two datasets cannot be regarded as independent because  even though the methods through which the frequency estimates were obtained were different  the plants used in the second dataset were a subset of the plants of the first 
We thus have only four independent estimates in each case  and there is minimal power to detect significant deviations from neutrality with such a small sample size 
It should be noted at this stage that deviations from the expected value could also be caused either by slight deviations from the   ratio in the infecting mixed solution  or by deviations from that ratio in the frequency of the viral particles that actually get into the plants 
Second  because of the relatively small sample sizes and low statistical power  the tests presented above could have detected only large deviations The results clearly show  however  precisely that the markers do not have large effects  if any  and that therefore recombination estimates would be affected only very slightly by any hypothetical selective effects of the markers 
Because of this  along with the fact that the introduced markers provoke silent substitutions in the CaMV genome  we assumed that markers were effectively neutral in the rest of the analysis The dataset used to estimate the recombination frequency consisted of the   full genome length viral clones   from each of ten co infected plants  individually genotyped for each of the four markers 
As discussed in detail in the Results  recombination was very frequent and concerned all four markers 
Indeed  approximately half of the genotyped clones exhibited a recombinant genotype 
It was therefore meaningful to try to obtain quantitative estimates of recombination from our data Our aim was to analyze viral recombination in a live host 
Consequently  we had to deal with the fact that more than one viral replication cycle occurred during the   d that infection lasted in our experiment  we had to wait that long for the disease to develop and to be able to recover sufficient amounts of viral DNA from each infection 
Based on the kinetics of gene expression    we postulate that each replication cycle lasts between   and   d  and that therefore seven to ten cycles occurred between infection and the sampling time 
In case this assumption is incorrect  we did calculations assuming five  seven  ten  or   replication cycles during these   d  As shown  the results were not affected qualitatively  and only slightly quantitatively 
It is important to note that we assumed that recombination occurred through a template switching mechanism  and that therefore  from a recombination point of view  the CaMV genome is linear 
The reverse transcription starts and finishes at the position   in Figure   which is the point of circularization of the DNA genome 
This implies that changes between contiguous markers a–b  b–c  and c–d can be considered as true recombination whereas those between a and d cannot  as they may simply stem from circularization of DNA  during the synthesis of which the polymerase has switched template once anywhere between a–b  b–c  or c–d To estimate the recombination rate between markers  we wrote recurrence equations describing the change in frequency of each genotype over one generation  assuming random mating and no selection  i e  the standard Wright–Fisher population genetics model 
We then expressed the frequency of all possible genotypes n generations later as a function of their initial frequency and of the recombination parameters 
Subsequently we calculated the maximum likelihood estimates of the recombination parameters and their asymptotic variances given initial frequencies  we assumed that the two  parental  genotypes  Mark S and Cabb S  had equal initial frequencies of   and that all other genotypes had initial frequencies of zero  and frequencies after n generations  the observed frequencies  as stated above we used different values of n 
All algebraic and numerical calculations were carried out with the software Mathematica The recombination parameters are the recombination rates between two adjacent loci  e g  r
  for the recombination rate between markers a and b  and the interference coefficients  e g  i
  for interference between recombination events in the segments between markers a and b and b and c  To define these parameters we followed Christiansen    and in particular the recombination distributions for two  three  and four loci  respectively  Tables     and   of   
It is important to realize that given the definitions of these parameters  the estimator of the recombination rate between two loci is not affected by the number of loci considered 
In other words  we obtain the same estimation of the recombination rate between markers a and b whether we consider genotypic frequencies at just these two loci  or the frequencies at these two loci plus a third locus  or the complete information to which we have access  the four marker genotypes 
Information on additional loci only affects the estimates of the interference coefficients It proved impossible to carry out the calculations for four loci algebraically 
Instead  we used a computer program to calculate the expected genotypic frequencies at all four loci after n generations  given the above stated initial frequencies and specified recombination parameters 
For each combination of recombination parameters we calculated a Euclidean distance between the vector of the expected genotypic frequencies and the observed genotypic frequencies  and considered that the estimated recombination parameters were those yielding the minimal Euclidean distance 
In all cases  the estimated recombination rates between pairs of loci were equal to the second decimal to those estimated algebraically from data for three or two loci Tumor Restrictions to Oncolytic VirusIn most solid tumors the tumor interior displays a high cellular density with multiple cell types  both malignant and normal  stromal  cells  interdigitated by strands of extracellular matrix  ECM  and other poorly defined tissue 
Stromal cells typically consist of fibroblasts  macrophages  neutrophils and other immune cell types 
Tumor associated fibroblasts are a source of the bulk acellular tissue in tumors    which is largely made up of polysugars and glycoproteins  such as collagens  laminins  fibronectins  proteoglycans  hyaluronan and water  forming a dense matrix around and between the cancer cells   
This matrix provides structural support but also haptotactic and chemotactic guidance for cancer cells   
Moreover  the prevailing tumor interstitium is rich in soluble angiogenic factors  such as members of the vascular endothelial growth factor  VEGF  family    cellular growth factors  including endothelial growth factor  EGF  basic fibroblast growth factor  FGF  platelet derived growth factor  PDGF  and pleiotrophic factors  particularly transforming growth factor  TGF  beta   
Additionally  both tumor  and stromal cells secrete cytokines and chemokines  such as interleukin  IL    IL   tumor necrosis factor  TNF  alpha  stromal cell derived factor  SDF    macrophage migration inhibitory factor  MIF    which on one hand recruit more stromal and progenitor cells into the tumors and on the other hand curb the activity of antigen presenting cells and anti tumor T cells   
In several independent cancer types  high serum levels of IL   and IL   are indicators of poor prognosis   Aberrant tumor and stromal growth combined with an overproduction of matrix leads to high interstitial pressure in the tumor  preventing lateral diffusion of therapeutic compounds within the tumor 
Tight cellular compactness combined with a high tumor proliferation rate also causes physical crowding and puts constraints on oxygenation  which due to aberrant angiogenesis and rupture of the haphazard vessels is mostly incomplete and results in chronic tissue hypoxia toward the tumor cores 
As cancer cells exist in a crowding hypoxic  and cytokine growth factor perpetuated chronic state of stress  they upregulate a number of key cellular molecules that function as a collective defense against a wide range of therapies  including oncolytic viruses 
The properties of oncolytic viruses and their status in clinical development as well as various delivery options have been reviewed elsewhere   
In this review  we provide an overview of two of the main intratumoral barriers to oncolytic virus spread  the extracellular tumor make up and the intracellular antiviral defense mechanisms Tumor cellular structure and composition may in concert with abundant extracellular matrix  ECM  deposition pose a severe hurdle for systemic virus entry and propagation of infection within the tumor 
The extracellular matrix is a complex dense network consisting of multiple proteins  glycoproteins and polysaccharides including collagens  laminins  fibronectins  proteoglycans and hyaluronic acid   
The interstitial fluid pressure  IFP  in the tumor surrounding blood and lymphatic vessels is mainly created by the high cell density that forms an increased physical pressure outwards and does not allow free diffusion of therapeutics   
A high IFP generally predicts an aggressive tumor phenotype as tumor cells tend to escape from tumor margins where the pressure drops  thus facilitating spread of metastatic cells   
On the other hand  for therapeutic virus  interstitial fluid concentration gradients may pose a hurdle as passive diffusion in viable regions  typically the rim  may occur mainly outward   
Given the limited arsenal of known chemicals alleviating tumor compactness and the poor penetration drugs in general into the tumor tissue  this is a considerable problem that may not be easy to tackle 
Some strategies are discussed below Viruses are passive particles and rely either on radial cell to cell spread or on soluble diffusion across concentration gradients to reach their target cells and to propagate the infection 
Tumor matrix is critical in this regard  as it can block both forms of spread 
Passively diffusing viruses may physically not fit through the strands of the ECM 
This was shown for oncolytic herpes virus  which has an outer diameter of over   nm  and whose spreading could be improved by matrix degrading bacterial collagenase co injection   
Bilbao and coworkers showed that adenovirus entry into experimental hepatocellular carcinoma nodules in the livers of immunocompetent rats following intravenous or intraportal injection was directly related to the thickness of the ECM capsule enveloping the nodules   
On the other hand  we found using Semliki Forest virus  which has an outer diameter of about   nm  that even upon intratumoral injection spread was blocked by ECM  which formed a physical barrier for virus infection  Figure  The foremost option to reduce interstitial fluid pressure and to remove physical molecule barriers imposed by the ECM is to use matrix degrading enzymes 
These act by digesting collagen  fibrin  and other types of fibrillar matrix deposits  creating more space between cell clusters  and glycosaminoglycan polymers  known to limit fluid movement in tumors 
Simultaneously  such strategies may also expose more cell surface to viruses  increasing the likelihood of infection 
In a study by Kuriyama  trypsin or collagenase dispase was injected into subcutaneous U  and U  glioma xenografts in immunocompromised mice  followed by a reporter adenovirus   
Both types of ECM degrading enzymes increased tumor transduction by the virus  but when doses got too high  transduction efficacy suffered  demonstrating a balance between ECM degradation and oncolytic virus efficacy 
In another study  treatment of PC  tumors with vaccinia virus producing matrix metalloprotease  MMP    resulted in reduction of collagen IV fibrils and increase in virus penetration into tumor  which yielded elevated virus titers   
Hong et al 
targeted orthotopic neuroblastoma xenografts engineered to express MMP  with oncolytic HSV  achieving increased virus distribution compared to control tumors   
Similar results were obtained when human soft tissue sarcoma HSTS T overexpressing MMP  or MMP  were injected with oncolytic HSV   
MMP expressing tumors contained significantly less sulfated glycosaminoglycans compared to control tumors 
Other enzymes and protein effectors  either engineered into virus expression cassettes or provided exogenously  include hyaluronidase  decorin  various other MMPs  and notably relaxin a peptide hormone normally expressed during particular phase of pregnancy that does not possess tissue degrading activity itself  but instead induces a number of key collagen degrading proteases seemingly in a tumor specific manner   
Beyer showed that relaxin expressed by murine stem cells improved trastuzumab penetrance and therapy outcome in syngeneic tumor models   
In another study  chimeric adenovirus Ad  expressing relaxin showed increased tumor transduction and virus dissemination   Several other strategies to increase penetration of therapeutics in tumors have been developed   
While the stromal ECM capsule of tumor nodules acts as a physical barrier to virus entry following intravenous injection  it was possible to improve tumor infection by administering vaso active compounds  angiotensin II  histamine  nitroglycerine  before the virus   
This is interesting  as vasculature per se would not be expected to alter or influence the physical composition of the ECM  such as collagen strand thickness 
Instead  virus access to the tumor was improved  most likely by increased access from the blood via tumor stromal adjoining vessels 
Interestingly  in a study with oncolytic herpes virus  anti VEGF monoclonal antibody Bevacizumab given before intravenous virus injection gave poorer anti tumor efficacy than when given after the virus   
The study showed that while HSV is able to enter and infect tumors better through their leaky vasculature compared to Bevacizumab normalized vasculature  vascular normalization by Bevacizumab still gave superior combination efficacy when the virus was already in the tumor 
This effect was likely dependent on altering both physical and biological properties of the tumor  including interstitial pressure and oxygenation 
In another study  anti VEGF A antibody injections in nude mice harboring U  human glioma xenografts led to an increase in MMP  expression and reduction in collagen fiber content  facilitating improved distribution of oncolytic adenovirus within the tumor tissue   
In general  targeting tumor vasculature by oncolytic viruses and including agents that affect tumor vasculature in combination regimens is gaining interest    and it will be interesting to see more specific studies on how vascular acting agents may affect the physical barriers to oncolytic viruses Some viruses do not need an extracellular step for propagating infection  such as members of the herpes and poxvirus families  and may be able to spread from cell to cell 
For example  HSV  is able to infect neighboring cells via lateral tight junctions in a manner dependent on its glycoproteins E and I   
Vaccinia virus  on the other hand  induces so called actin tails  which are actin filament driven membranous protrusions of the plasma membrane harboring a single virus particle at the outer tip 
These actin tails actively deliver and deposit virus particles onto or even into neighboring cells   
Because lateral spread without an extracellular step may circumvent neutralizing immunity as well as some of the physical obstacles the tumor microenvironment imposes  this ability has been engineered into viruses that normally do not possess it 
A promising strategy is to engineer OVs to express membrane fusogenic genes  MFGs  such as gibbon ape leukemia virus  GALV  glycoprotein  reptilian reovirus p  protein  FAST  or the membrane glycoproteins H and F of measles virus   
Quite intriguingly  expression of several different MFGs by oncolytic adenovirus synergized with chemotherapy in anti tumor efficacy both in vitro and in vivo    suggesting that membrane fusion facilitated lateral spread of also chemotherapeutics  which otherwise would not have occurred in a compact tumor 
The potential limitation of cell to cell dependent spread  however  may be that membrane free physical barriers  such as the ECM  may still pose a barrier to spread 
Also  it is unclear whether MFGs or other mechanisms of lateral spread may assist in reaching distant tumor nests Some other strategies to alleviate matrix imposed restrictions to oncolytic viruses have been discussed elsewhere   Tumors of epithelial origin mostly retain the firm cellular integrity seen in their original adhesive intercellular configuration 
Several viruses use cellular receptors which are located in paracellular tight junctions  which may be problematic in tightly packed tumors   
Adenovirus C group viruses use coxsackie adenovirus receptor  CAR  as their primary entry point  whereas adenovirus B  group members and measles virus Edmonston use CD  complement binding molecule as their cellular receptor   
Adenovirus B  group  serotypes       and   entry occurs using desmoglein   DSG    
Of these  CAR and DSG  are preferentially located within tight junctions and are hidden from virus binding   
Also the complement receptor CD  was ascribed a role in maintenance of epithelial cell integrity by interactions with the E cadherin catenin network   
These observations imply that before reaching the potential entry site on the tumor cell the virus must find its way into the junctional space 
Moreover  it has become increasingly clear that for example glioma tumors traditionally targeted by Ad  serotype adenoviruses often express only low levels of CAR and instead much higher levels of CD    Beyond that tight junctions hide multiple virus receptors  they contain a network of adhesion molecules  including ZO  cadherins  claudins and occludin  which  if perturbed  is associated with more aggressive disease in many types of cancer   
Since tight junctions also contain important receptors that mediate tumor promoting signaling and which have been targeted by monoclonal antibodies  notably Her  it would be highly useful to develop strategies that temporarily loosen the tight junction contacts even at cost of a transient increase in tumor metastatic risk 
One of the most interesting approaches has been to exploit the natural propensity of adenovirus serotype   which as part of its natural life cycle creates dodecahedral particles  PtDd  consisting of viral capsid proteins  penton base and fiber that open tight junctions by binding to and dissolving desmoglein  dimers and reducing E cadherin expression  to develop a specific tight junction opening molecule  JO    
Adenovirus type   uses PtDds to promote its own infection  opening the tight junctions ahead of infection to maximize access to desmoglein 
Analogously  when administered to human tumor xenografts  JO  facilitated penetration of trastuzumab much deeper into the tumor tissue than when the monoclonal antibody was administered on its own   
Moreover  JO  synergized with several chemotherapeutics in solid tumor models   
Backed by our own findings with oncolytic SFV  showing that both extracellular matrix and tumor cell compactness restrict virus spread and oncolytic efficacy  we believe combination approaches that target both tight junctions and extracellular matrix will prove effective in future virotherapy development  Figure  An alternative approach to increasing tumor penetration by oncolytic viruses is to alter tumor cell morphology and status 
Notably  cell death and in particular the type of cell death induced by virus has been shown to affect virus distribution within a tumor mass  in a study by Nagano et al  administration of apoptosis inducing paclitaxel before injecting oncolytic herpes simplex virus increased virus dissemination in the tumor  allowing its diffuse in  tunnels  created by shrinking dying tumor cells   Maintenance of physiological adherence is essential for proper ECM function and for retaining cellular integrity 
Therefore  a potential caveat of using ECM degrading proteolytic enzymes or tight junction openers is the risk of neoplastic cell detachment from the tumor ECM and increased risk of metastasis 
While ECM degradation or tight junction opening may operate innocuously  there is also a chance that loss of E cadherins via proteases or via non specific deregulation of tight junction integrity during ECM modulating therapy could trigger pro tumorigenic Wnt β catenin signaling  possibly driving epithelial to mesenchymal transition   
One study showed that ectopic relaxin expression stimulated MMP expression and enhanced breast cancer invasiveness    whereas another paper found short term relaxin exposure to increase breast cancer cell motility whereas long term expression reduced both motility and cancer invasiveness   
In the context of oncolytic viruses  Lavilla Alonso tested several proteases  including hyaluronidase  relaxin  and macrophage metalloelastase  and showed they all could assist adenovirus entry into tumors  yet  the authors did not detect treatment induced metastases or increase in tumor invasiveness   
Another strategy possibly balancing some of the putative risks of tight junction disruption could be to use Wnt dependent oncolytic viruses   Tumors are invariably fenestrated by host fibroblasts  myeloid cells and other non transformed cells  which driven by cancer induced cues can adopt various reprogrammed phenotypes to promote tumor angiogenesis and growth and to alter tumor responses to therapies   
As most of them normally play a role in immune homeostasis and pathogen sensing  they also respond to and influence oncolytic virus infection of tumors Fulci et al 
reported that injection of oncolytic HSV  directly into glioblastoma tumor parenchyma triggered upregulation of CD  and CD  monocytic markers and rapid clearance of virus  likely executed by infiltrating phagocytic cells   
When clodronate liposomes were used to deplete macrophages in vivo  the authors observed a  fold increase in virus titers in the brain tumors concomitant with an   reduction in peripheral CD  macrophages in animal spleens  suggesting that CD  cells migrate into the tumors upon virus injection and limit overall oncolytic efficacy 
While CD  cells were not reduced by peripheral macrophage depletion  arguing that these cells had been recruited to the tumors before the treatment  they could be eliminated in live glioma slices ex vivo  resulting in a  fold increase in virus replication 
Macrophages may secrete antiviral type I interferon constitutively at very low  subnanomolar  levels   and recently Liu et al 
showed that tumor resident CD  macrophages induced a protective antiviral state in ovarian and breast tumors which led to resistance to oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus  VSV  infection   
Type I IFN signaling  JAK  inhibitor Ruxolitinib reversed the resistance  facilitating VSV replication in the macrophage protected cancer cells 
It is tempting to speculate that tumor resident macrophages also rendered syngeneic GL  and DBT mouse gliomas completely refractory to VA  oncolytic alphavirus  as these cells were quite infectable in vitro and live glioma slices regained their sensitivity to virus within   h  indicating dilution of IFN I   Macrophages or the closely related myeloid suppressor cells are the predominant stromal cell type in many tumors and are actively recruited during cancer progression   
Heavy macrophage presence in the tumors indicates that such tumors may be resistant to oncolytic virotherapy  unless depleting preconditioning would be used 
Moreover  as part of the early immune response to virus infection  monocytic cells are rapidly recruited to tumors following intratumoral virus injection 
In one study  depletion of either CD b  cells or VEGF secreted by these cells in mice treated with oncolytic HSV  greatly increased oncolytic efficacy  tentatively linking pro tumorigenic and antiviral angiogenic mechanisms   Another key pro tumorigenic signaling employed by many tumors is up regulation of CXCR  the receptor for chemokine CXCL   also known as SDF  and recruitment of stromal cells expressing CXCL  which maintain the tumor and recruit additional cells to support tumor expansion and invasion  such as endothelial cell progenitors which contribute to neovascularization   
Indeed  high CXCR  expression is a negative prognostic factor for many cancers 
Oncolytic vaccinia virus engineered to express a soluble antagonist of CXCR  showed improved intratumoral virus replication  increased vascular disruption and a markedly reduced infiltration of the tumors by putative immune suppressive and tumor promoting stromal cells   
This study highlights how reducing pro tumor stromal cell effects may alleviate antiviral resistance and yield increased overall therapeutic efficacy 
On the other hand  if the paracrine antiviral effects of tumor homing monocytic cells could be selectively abrogated these cells could favorably be used to ferry oncolytic viruses into tumors 
Indeed  a significant delay in metastatic tumor potential was achieved when macrophages were harnessed to deliver a tumor specific oncolytic adenovirus   What is the antiviral status in human cancer 
Recent analyses from different normal cells that occupy the same organ reveal striking functional variation in components of the type I IFN signaling pathway that correlate with the tissue tropism and virulence of some virus strains   
Can similar variation in such components be found in cancer cells  or do cancer cells make an exception Transformed cells undergo selective elimination by the immune system before becoming cancerous  termed immunoediting  based on observations of differential capacity of immunocompetent mice to reject tumors previously grown in immunocompromised hosts versus syngeneic animals   
Cancer cell responsiveness to type I and type II IFNs plays a role during immunoediting  cancer cells that eventually progress to form a tumor display reduced capacity to respond to IFN gamma  which otherwise would upregulate MHC class I molecules and render the tumors amenable to CD  T cell mediated destruction  whereas responsiveness to type I interferon initially helps tumors avoid immune purging during the editing phase and is then irrelevant   
Of note  the anti tumor effects of type I IFN  still exploited today in several cancers  were shown to depend on host NK cells  and mice in which IFNAR was blocked by monoclonal antibody failed to reject even highly immunogenic tumors  as opposed to mice treated with control antibody  who all rejected the immunogenic tumor challenge   
Thus  whereas tumor responsiveness to type I IFN is not predetermined after immunoediting  other factors post immunoediting may influence it In several tumor types  varying levels of expression of components of the type I IFN signaling cascade have been detected  and in some tumor types these components have been found to have prognostic value  whereas in others they do not seem to influence survival   
However  emerging data suggests that antiviral genes may predict poor survival because they increase treatment resistance 
In one study  poor prognosis of several types of cancer due to genotoxic treatment resistance was found to correlate with increased activity of IFN I pathway genes   
In this study  a triad of type I IFN signaling pathway genes  STAT  ISG  and IFIT  formed a pan tumor type negative prognostic factor  and a broader seven gene cluster established negative prognostic criteria for treatment resistant breast cancer 
Treatment resistance was subsequently shown to depend on STAT  signaling  STAT expressing tumor clones were positively selected in animals in vivo  demonstrating increased proliferation and metastatic potential  and STAT expression mediated resistance against genotoxic assault by doxorubicin or ionizing radiation  knockdown of STAT  resulted in lower proliferation rate and metastatic capacity and increased sensitivity to genotoxic stress    
In another study  resistance to epigenetic DNA modifiers  AZA dC  a methyltransferase inhibitor  and LBH  or MGCD  both histone deacetylase  HDAC  inhibitors  was correlated with increased expression of IFN I pathway genes in small lung cancer cells   
Basal IFN related gene expression in several different SML cell lines was upregulated Interestingly  in many cancers  STAT proteins are not phosphorylated and persist in unphosphorylated form  U STAT 
Like its phosphorylated counterpart  U STAT  increases expression of genes contributing to resistance to DNA damaging agents   
While it is currently unknown why cancers may prefer to use unphosphorylated forms  it is known that U STATs activate distinct signals compared to their phosphorylated counterparts 
However  importantly for oncolytic viruses  in many tumors  constant expression and release of type I IFN leads to a constitutively high level of unphosphorylated forms of STAT  STAT  and IRF  which together form an unphosphorylated but functional ISGF like complex that relocalizes to the nucleus and drives expression of a specific set of ISGs distinct from acute IFN I exposure   
These ISGs are sufficient to maintain a functional antiviral defense and they play a critical role in resistance to DNA damaging agents On a cellular level  virus replication is controlled by antiviral defense molecules    which in turn are primarily controlled by type I IFN signaling 
In addition to classical type I IFN  or cytokine induced antiviral signaling  tumors may employ other antiviral defense mechanisms 
For example  stromal cells may secrete peptides with antiviral properties called defensins   
The defensins are amphiphatic and typically  –  amino acids in length and interfere with viruses by physically binding to and disrupting virus particles and or by inducing antiviral responses in target cells via pattern recognition receptors 
At least oral squamous cell carcinomas were found to overexpress defensins compared to normal control tissues   
While the role of defensins in oncolytic virus infection of tumors is unclear  one study showed that the immune stimulating properties of defensins may be exploited to increase overall therapeutic efficacy 
In this study  expression of beta   defensin from a conditionally replicating adenovirus yielded a superior therapeutic entity compared to the unarmed parental virus via enhanced anti tumor immune responses mediated by TLR dependent activation of dendritic cells   In summary  human cancers display varying degrees of expression of antiviral proteins or their signaling regulators at baseline 
Some of these may increase in response to genotoxic anti cancer treatments 
In the next chapter we will highlight some of the consequences to oncolytic virotherapy of the heterogeneity in type I IFN responsiveness in tumor cells All oncolytic viruses tested to date display variable infectivity in different cancer cell lines 
This variability is likely at least partly dependent on type I IFN as most oncolytic viruses are IFN sensitive 
IFN secretion follows virus sensing by the cells via Toll like receptors expressed on both the plasma membrane and in endocytotic vesicles  NOD like receptors  STING  AIM  NLP inflammosome and other danger sensing molecules  summarized elsewhere   
While all viruses carry an arsenal of counteracting molecules    no virus goes completely undetected 
Even HSV amplicons  which are devoid of functional virus genes  induce a type I IFN response that mediates a STAT dependent system wide antiviral defense in mice within one hour of intravenous vector injection  resulting in significant reduction of transgene expression compared to expression in STAT  knockout animals   During our own studies with attenuated SFV vector VA  it became apparent that the dramatic and lasting therapeutic efficacy achieved following mere single intravenous  or intratumoral  injection of the virus in immunocompromised mice bearing human A  melanoma or U  glioma xenografts   was not going to be recapitulated easily in immunocompetent animals   
The paradox in our studies was that while oncolytic SFV vector VA  effectively replicated in and destroyed a variety of IFN responsive cancer cell lines in vitro  it consistently failed to eradicate tumors generated from the same cell types in vivo  even if large doses of virus were injected directly into the tumor mass and even if the tumors were void of visible physical barriers  Figure  
Conversely  only tumors generated from IFN unresponsive cancer cells have seemed infectable in vivo by VA  so far 
In light of earlier findings by others  showing that type I IFN receptor knockout mice are highly susceptible to SFV infection and quickly succumb to multi organ systemic infection    the parameters for oncolytic SFV efficacy seem clear  tumor cells must be defective in type I IFN response for the virus to be effective These findings are in line with emerging data from other groups  showing a remarkably strict dependence of oncolytic virus replication on defective type I IFN responsiveness  a dogma introduced at the turn of the  st century   
For example  sarcomas and melanomas display differing permissiveness to oncolytic VSV  an obstacle which may be overcome by blocking type I IFN signaling   
In eight sarcoma cell lines  basal up regulation of RIG I and IFIT  and rapid induction of STAT  phosphorylation upon IFN I treatment correlated with resistance to oncolytic measles virus   
In other studies  human pancreatic and ovarian cancer cells display resistance against Rb dependent oncolytic adenovirus  strongly correlating with intracellular levels of MxA  and acquired resistance to repeated oncolytic adenovirus injections in an intraperitoneal ovarian carcinoma model was associated with an increase in MxA as well as several other key ISGs in the tumors   
A study comparing normal human or mouse melanocytes to a panel of melanoma cells revealed strong correlation between permissiveness to oncolytic VSV and capacity to mount antiviral defense in response to type I IFN   
In this study  VSV rp  harboring two mutations in P and L genes  was superior to several other tested oncolytic VSV strains  but the dependence on defective IFN responsiveness was still retained 
In yet another study  oncolytic VSV replicated in four out of twelve mesothelioma cell lines which were unable to mount antiviral defense upon IFN beta pretreatment or to respond to infection by up regulation of PKR  MxA or  OAS mRNA   
In contrast  the non permissive mesothelioma cells mounted antiviral defense  associated with PKR  MxA or  OAS mRNA up regulation  in response to infection or to exogenous type I IFN 
The authors of this study further linked the observed pattern of virus resistance to clinical mesothelioma samples  where in a mesothelioma tissue array  significant variance in immunoreactivity against PKR  p  and or IFNAR was observed  with only a few samples displaying lack of reactivity against all three components  arguing that most tumors in clinical settings would display at least some level of resistance to oncolytic VSV Oncolytic adenoviruses are often deleted for E A  which normally binds Rb and prevents it from sequestering E F  which results in the viruses being unable to replicate in normal cells 
However  since adenovirus  as with all viruses  contains elements that antagonize antiviral defenses  such elements have also been targets for deletion to render the virus sensitive to innate antiviral defenses  which would be expected to remain intact only in normal cells 
Cancer cells expressing Ras may down regulate protein kinase R and inhibit type I IFN induction by interfering with RIG I signaling   
Also  select interferon stimulated genes appear to be repressed by the Ras MEK ERK signaling cascade   
PKR activation shuts down E F dependent translation  including translation of virus messenger RNAs 
Therefore  an adenovirus deleted for VA RNA  which antagonizes PKR  should be capable of replicating in Ras overexpressing  tumor  cells 
However  while this was seemingly the case    it was later discovered that Ras is not an obligatory determinant for PKR inactivation and that virus replication was halted even in Ras overexpressing cells via functional PKR mediated E F phosphorylation  implying that the parameters of VA RNA deleted adenovirus replication had to be revised   
Similar findings were obtained with oncolytic reovirus  against which Ras independent tumor resistance emerged in vivo   
Thus  under some circumstances even tumor cells over expressing Ras may respond to type I IFN or to stimulants of pattern recognition receptors  activating PKR and inhibiting virus translation 
To complicate matters  MEK inhibitors have been shown restore antiviral signaling capacity in Ras overexpressing tumors   
This implies that human tumors treated with MEK inhibitors  such as Trametinib which was recently approved for treatment of BRAF mutated melanoma  may be poor targets for oncolytic viruses as antiviral signaling capacity in such tumors may be restored Some oncolytic viruses  such as members of the poxvirus family  are seemingly resistant to the antiviral effects of type I IFNs in vitro and may be controlled by other cellular factors   
However  in most cases  sensitivity or resistance to type I IFN is assessed in vitro and using only one cytokine  which may mask synergies with other factors present in vivo 
One possible explanation for the in vitro–in vivo discrepancy is the tumor micro environment  which not only imposes physical barriers to oncolytic viruses but also alters intracellular antiviral defenses 
For example  glioma cells were found in the brain to spontaneously secrete type I IFN  which conferred resistance against oncolytic HSV 
Resistance was linked to ECM protein CCN  interaction with glioma cell surface receptor alpha   beta   integrin  which activated interferon secretion   
It is tempting to speculate whether this or a similar ECM glioma interaction could have contributed to the resistance of syngeneic glioma cells we observed in vivo but not in vitro to both oncolytic SFV and vaccinia virus  FIG    
Also  while critical in many respects  antiviral signaling may occur without signaling via type I IFN receptor  IFNAR 
For instance  upon infection of IFNAR KO mice with murine hepatitis virus  MHV  brain cells were found to have upregulated antiviral GTPase TGTP and IFITm  and IFITm  all of which have confirmed antiviral activity in vivo against a variety of viruses   
In these cases  IFN gamma and TNF alpha likely account for at least part of the observed ISG activity  where e g  TGTP is upregulated by IFN γ signaling and TNFα has been shown to induce ISG  independently of IFNAR   Interestingly  while most cancers are heterogeneous in antiviral defence signaling  one broad class of tumors in particular may display consistently low capacity to ward off oncolytic viruses  oncovirus induced cancers 
This is because oncoviruses  as all viruses  carry a complement of factors that abrogate antiviral sensors and effectors  which may result in tumors that are uniformly devoid of antiviral signaling 
In an intriguing study  oncolytic VSV infected and destroyed human papilloma virus  HPV positive cervical carcinoma cells more effectively than HPV negative head  and neck cancer cells due to HPV E mediated suppression of antiviral signaling   
HPV positive or E expressing xenografts were efficiently eradicated from nude mice following VSV injection 
The potential of this approach is that even oncolytic viruses that are extremely sensitive to type I IFN  such as attenuated SFV or M mutated VSV  may function well against oncovirus induced cancers where the oncovirus machinery ensures the lack of antiviral defense While on first thought it would appear counterintuitive to antagonize the very factors that keep oncolytic viruses tumor specific  emerging data shows that this can be accomplished in a safe way 
One of the foremost strategies to increase oncolytic virus efficacy is to combine them with drugs that lower tumor antiviral defenses 
In this regard  a primary target for interference is the prototypical type I IFN signaling cascade 
While small molecular inhibitors against IFNAR are not available  activity of downstream signaling transducers may effectively be blocked 
Human pancreatic cancer cells were shown to constitutively express high levels of MxA and OAS and to mount type I IFN dependent resistance to oncolytic VSV 
Resistance could be overcome by blocking activity of IFNAR associated Janus kinase  JAK      
Similarly  JAK  inhibitor ruxolitinib overcame type I IFN dependent resistance of human SCC  head and neck cancer cells against oncolytic VSV   
Ruxolitinib also successfully abrogated type I IFN mediated antiviral effects elicited by macrophages    highlighting that this drug might also alleviate type I IFN dependent tumor resistance to oncolytic viruses imposed by stromal cells 
However  the obvious downside to using JAK inhibitors is their effects on critical host defense mechanisms  which may result in increased infection of normal cells 
Moreover  JAK inhibitors may reduce anti tumor immune responses elicited by oncolytic virotherapy 
For example  ruxolitinib was shown to impair the capacity of dendritic cells promote CD  T cell responses against model tumor antigens   
On the other hand  in this study clearance of adenovirus was delayed in ruxolitinib treated normal animals  which makes it difficult to predict the overall impact of JAK inhibitors on tumor therapy where prolonged virus presence might translate to better therapeutic efficacy 
Also  while the immune stimulating and anti tumor effects of type I and type II interferons may be adversely affected by JAK inhibitors  central tumor promoting cascades mediated by JAKs  such as IL STAT  may also be inhibited    yielding a difficult to predict net therapeutic outcome 
At the moment  more studies are needed to establish the overall impact of interference with JAK  signaling in cancer therapy Spurred by earlier reports of oncovirus reactivation and promoter enhancement by histone deacetylase  HDAC  inhibitors  this class of agents was assessed for capacity to enhance oncolytic virus potency by inhibiting antiviral responses 
Indeed  such enhancement was observed with oncolytic VSV and SFV  and while it has been difficult to pinpoint the exact mechanisms that underlie HDAC inhibitor enhancement of oncolytic virus replication in cancer cells  antiviral defenses in general are inhibited for yet unknown reasons mainly in cancer cells and not in normal cells  which indirectly facilitates virus replication   
Interestingly  combination of HDAC inhibitors with conditionally replicating   E A deleted adenovirus gave improved virus replication rate and therapeutic efficacy in subcutaneous xenograft models only when the inhibitors were given before the virus  otherwise inhibition of replication was observed   
Similarly  HDAC inhibitors increased replication and oncolytic efficacy of HSV when given before the virus but not when given at the same time   
With nuclear DNA viruses  such as adenovirus and HSV  it is possible that HDAC inhibitors also alter virus genome accessibility to transcription factors  resulting in reduced replication or other adverse effects  implying that with these viruses HDAC inhibitors should be administered before the viruses Recently  it was found that HDAC inhibitor vorinostat activates NfκB signaling by facilitating hyperacetylation of the p  subunit  which in turn activates cellular autophagy   
Autophagy was in another study shown to be important for VSV replication  presumably by inhibiting antiviral signaling 
This is interesting  as a previous study revealed enhancement of VSV replication by inhibiting TNF alpha induced antiviral signaling mediated by p  using NfκB inhibitors BMS  or TPCA    
In this study  neither inhibitor had an effect on STAT  or STAT  phosphorylation or their nuclear relocalization in response to type I IFN but the authors observed clear induction of ISG  GBP  and MX  in response to type I IFN in U  glioma cells  with the latter two being dependent on NfκB signaling 
Taken together  NfκB pathway activation may result in different antiviral responses in different cancer types  and inhibition or enhancement of oncolytic viruses by NfκB inhibitors is dependent on other concomitant cellular mechanisms  such as autophagy Since HDAC inhibitors modulate promoter activity accessibility  it is conceivable other epigenetic or promoter modifying agents could work in a similar manner to repress antiviral defense induction and enhance oncolytic viruses   
DNA demethylating agents  azacytidine  Aza  and decitabine synergized with oncolytic herpes simplex type   virus in glioma models in vitro and in vivo  as did HDAC inhibitor valproic acid  VPA  which was already shown before to work well with oncolytic HSV as well as several other oncolytic viruses   
Moreover  inhibition of cancer antiviral defenses  specifically RNAseL and PKR  resulted when cancer cells were exposed to sunitinib  a multi tyrosine kinase inhibitor originally developed as an inhibitor of VEGF R and PDGF R signaling  yielding strong anti tumor synergy with IFN sensitive oncolytic VSV   
Since sunitinib is approved for renal cell carcinoma and imatinib resistant gastric cancers  combination with oncolytic VSV constitutes a promising and clinically relevant approach warranting further investigation 
Interstingly  sunitinib as well as several other receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors displayed antiviral effects against polyomavirus BK    arguing that these compounds are not universal virus enhancers Cyclophosphamide  CPA  is a general immunosuppressant used to minimize Treg presence during immunotherapy and also oncolytic virotherapy 
CPA may  however  also enhance replication and efficacy of oncolytic viruses by diminishing cytokine secretion by stromal cells  including type I IFN   
Another compound enhancing oncolytic virus efficacy by lowering cell responsiveness to type I IFN is triptolide  which acts downstream of IRF  activation   
Further  the kinase mammalian target of rapamycin  mTOR  enhances the antiviral effects of type I IFN by activation of its effector proteins  E BP  which binds and inactivates translation factor eIF E  and S K  which carries out cell type specific signaling functions of type I IFN  such as activation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor  B and promotion of ISG  transcription 
Consequently  rapamycin was able to enhance oncolytic VSV replication and anti tumor efficacy by inhibiting type I IFN mediated antiviral signaling via mTOR   Several other compounds synergizing with oncolytic viruses have been identified via high throughput drug library screening  many of which seem to act by antagonizing antiviral defenses 
For instance  a novel virus sensitizer  Vse  was found to greatly diminish antiviral effects of type I IFN against oncolytic VSV in several cancer cell types  and the drug also synergized with the virus in subcutaneous mouse tumor models   
For many of these new compounds  the mechanism of action is still poorly understood  necessitating extensive safety studies to exclude undesirable effects against normal cells Apart from classical type I IFN induced antiviral defenses  which typically prevent virus translation and degrade virus genomes  other cellular machineries regulate oncolytic virus efficacy 
Notably  strategies to increase cancer cell death in response to oncolytic viruses have been tested 
In a recent study  a class of compounds called SMAC mimetics synergized in several cancer models with oncolytic VSV by removing cancer cell block to apoptosis in response to virus induced type I IFN  TNF α or TRAIL   
Interestingly  since virus infection triggered cytokines act on nearby non infected cells  SMAC mimetics may in combination with oncolytic viruses also cause significant bystander tumor destruction 
Normal cells are not affected by the IFN SMAC mimetic synergy  providing an important safety aspect 
In another study  blocking the ER stress response circuitry triggered by oncolytic rhabdovirus infection by a small molecular inhibitor of serine threonine protein kinase and endoribonuclease IRE α  which was identified in a genome wide siRNA screen  greatly enhanced cytotoxicity via caspase induced apoptosis and increased oncolytic efficacy in refractory tumor models in mice   
This effect was independent on induction or responsiveness to type I IFN 
Conversely  inhibitors of nucleoside transporter   ENT  were discovered from a high throughput screen of enhancers of oncolytic HSV  and to date such inhibitors have not been reported to alter cellular antiviral responses   
Other compounds  such as common chemotherapeutics  and their mechanisms synergizing with oncolytic viruses have been discussed elsewhere for most of them the possible role of antiviral defense antagonism in enhancing oncolytic virus efficacy remains to be studied   Thus  many compounds are available to interfere with tumor antiviral defenses 
The outstanding question for most of them  however  seems to be why such compounds do not render normal cells sensitive to oncolytic viruses 
Elucidation of the exact mechanisms of action and the differences between normal and cancer cells constitute a worthy goal for studies in the near future Already in the  s it became clear that using certain pathogenic wildtype viruses  such as West Nile virus and Bunyamwera virus  in cancer patients would result in off target toxicity   
Characteristic for pathogenic viruses is a greater ability to circumvent or antagonize cellular innate antiviral defenses than attenuated strains 
For example  unlike the prototypical oncolytic reovirus strain type   Dearing  the T L strain of reovirus causes accumulation of IRF  in the nucleus and inhibits activation of a select group of ISGs yet because of this property the T L strain is myocarditic unlike the oncolytic type   Dearing strain   
For these reasons  many oncolytic viruses used today  such as reovirus type   Dearing  oncolytic strains of Newcastle disease virus and M mutated VSV have either a stronger capacity to induce or a weaker capacity to resist antiviral type I IFN than the corresponding wildtype strains   An open question  however  is whether strain specific or virus specific differences that relate to specific components of the cellular antiviral machinery may be exploited for greater anti tumor efficacy  i e  if one virus fails  could another be used in its stead 
While Ras expression was critical for oncolytic reovirus replication in cells overexpressing CUG  oncogene  oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus was unable to replicate in the same cells due to increased activation of STAT  and OASL    
Thus  in these cells reovirus was not affected by STAT  or OASL  and it therefore remains interesting to see which other antiviral effectors may have been lacking in the CUG expressing cells and  conversely  how reovirus and VSV differ in terms of sensitivity to antiviral effectors 
While several oncolytic viruses have been compared to each other in terms of replication rate and cytotoxicity  systematic studies with regard to tumor antiviral defenses have not been conducted As any attenuated virus is likely to replicate effectively only in its own niche  i e  to be restricted by a specific set of ISGs  and as wild type strains may be too toxic for use in humans  a compromise may be achieved by incorporating select elements from wild type viruses into oncolytic virus backbones 
Indeed  several chimeric and recombinant viruses have been generated that harbor specific elements of wild type strains or even of other unrelated viruses in order to better resist cancer antiviral defenses  Table  
As an example of introducing wild type elements into attenuated viruses  Haralambieva reported on a measles virus Edmonston vaccine strain in which P gene was replaced with the counterpart from the wild type IC B strain   
Later  Meng et al 
included N  P  and L genes from wild type measles in Edmonston backbone  producing an enhanced but still safe oncolytic virus   
Edmonston vaccine virus induces a more robust IFN response compared to wild type measles virus partly due to the weaker ability of V protein to suppress MDA mediated activation of IRF  and IFN I induction   
In vivo  P gene encoded proteins  particularly V  control the quality of the cytokine response to measles so that vaccine strains qualitatively induce a stronger inflammatory response compared to WT strains  where WT V protein suppresses multiple cytokine secretion 
V protein short cytoplasmic tail has been shown to bind and inactivate STAT  IRF  MDA  and the Rel homology domain of the NfκB subunit p  but not of p    
Also  V causes LGP  protein to bind and inactivate RIG I    but it seemingly does not interfere with TICAM   TRIF  multiple TLR adaptor  including TLR mediated IFN β induction 
Thus  if cancer and normal cells would differ with regard to TICAM  or IRF  then such a virus could potentially target specifically cancer cells rather than normal cells 
So far  the measles Edmonston WT chimeras have proven safe in animals As an example of heterologous virus constructs  lentogenic Newcastle disease virus engineered to express influenza virus PR   H N  NS  showed enhanced oncolytic efficacy in vivo due to dampening of antiviral responses   
While such a virus did not display enhanced pathogenicity in that study  a mesogenic NDV virus harboring NS  from influenza strain H N  did show increased pathogenicity in chickens as well as an increased ability to replicate in human cells    raising some cautionary warnings for future engineering of similar replicative viruses 
As another example  vaccinia virus soluble type I IFN scavenger B R  NOTE  B R is often used in the literature  has been engineered into both oncolytic HSV and oncolytic rhabdoviruses  resulting in all cases in more effective therapy agents without loss of tumor specificity   
Oncolytic γ  gene deleted HSV was complemented by two different PKR antagonists from human cytomegalovirus  TRS  and IRS  generating a chimera capable of reaching wild type virus replication levels in cancer cells in vitro and in tumor models in vivo   The selection of various viral IFN I antagonists that potentially could be used to augment attenuated oncolytic viruses is vast   
For example  increased replication of several viruses  including HIV  Sindbis virus and E deleted adenovirus in mammalian cells was observed when the cells were engineered to express vaccinia virus E L protein  influenza A virus NS  protein  ebola virus VP  protein or HIV  Tat protein   
The choice of antagonist must primarily be made with safety in mind  but virus specific and cell specific differences in antagonist functions may potentially be exploited rationally when considering the overall combination 
For example  vaccinia virus E L is able to rescue VSV but not EMCV from exogenous IFN  whereas vaccinia virus K L partially rescued EMCV but not VSV   In anticipation of systematic  perhaps bioinformatically guided   super chimera  studies  two or more viruses that may complement each other s shortcomings in antiviral defense antagonism have been considered 
Notably  vaccinia virus was favorably combined with IFN I sensitive oncolytic VSV and SFV  yielding tumor model dependent increases in overall therapy efficacy that were dependent on vaccinia virus antagonism of type I IFN responses  which increased the replication of the IFN sensitive viruses   
Such heterologous virotherapy approaches may also be used to generate immunological synergy  similar to heterologous prime boost vaccination  anti tumor immune responses may be increased due to targeting of the tumor by two different viruses  on two separate occasions  but anti virus immune responses would be generated against different viruses each time  avoiding the problem of neutralizing immunity to and predominance of antivirus immune responses   
Some other ideas explored experimentally include engineering oncolytic viruses to express other oncolytic viruses 
For example  the entire oncolytic parvovirus H  genome was placed under a regulatable promoter in oncolytic adenovirus  resulting in a more effective therapeutic entity than either virus alone without loss of tumor specificity   
The genetic material of Semliki Forest virus replicons has been engineered into adenovirus and vaccinia virus backbones   and several other virus chimeras have been constructed   
However  the effects on tumor antiviral defenses of such a constructs remain to be studied The attribute  oncolytic  implies for a virus that it infects and  indeed  lyses the infected tumor 
This property is primarily tested in vitro in cultured tumor cells 
We have learned  however  that in the native tumor microenvironment in living hosts many viruses are no longer able to infect tumor cells or to kill them even if they manage to infect them 
Tightly packed tumor cells and the network of supportive molecules of the extracellular matrix form a physical barrier to virus particle diffusion 
It has also become evident that the tumor cells themselves may be much more capable of thwarting oncolytic virus advances than previously thought  with some tumor cells residing in a seemingly permanent non permissive antiviral state 
Tumors harbor multiple cell types in addition to the neoplastic cells  which may promote and propagate both physical and cellular virus resistance 
As the efficacy of virotherapy in human cancer patients still falls shy of the achievements in animal models  it appears quite plausible that one or more of the barriers described in this review indeed constitute a real and formidable obstacle for oncolytic virus advancement into routine clinical use 
Fortunately  some of the most difficult barriers have been identified  and a rapidly expanding arsenal of countermeasures is at our disposal 
Our task is now to separate the wheat from the chaff and to systematically evaluate the proposed combination regimens that will yield the best results without compromising patient safety Evidence of prenatal toxicity of herbal based indigenous formulations for sex selection in rat modelsTraditional or indigenous preparations  IPs  are getting considerable attention in global health debates  It continues to be used widely in several countries and its consumption is rapidly increasing 
 
  Many reports have documented the use of such preparations 
For instance  in China  traditional herbal medicines played a critical role during the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome  SARS  In fact  many drugs in modern medicine had their roots in the traditional system of medicine 
Drugs like Penicillin  from Penicillium fungi  and Digoxin  from Digitalis purpurea  are some such examples 
One of the promising therapies for Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus  MRSA  infection is a ninth century treatment for eye infections which is a recipe consisting of garlic and onions  wine  and bile from a cow s stomach brewed in a brass cauldron 
It is however important to note that culture specific practices are not always safe 
Digitalis is a classic example where herbalists use this plant in allopathic treatment strategies  while in some countries such as Britain  law restricts their vast availability  A report from Australia describes the adverse effects of ‘herbal  preparations or IPs  Problems arise when people do not report about the consumption of such preparations assuming that these are devoid of any side effects by virtue of them being natural products  The need for research in this field is huge and scientific research into the quality  safety  molecular effects and clinical efficacy is crucial 
 
 
Pregnancy is considered a time of minimal intervention  and a period when herbal medicines are usually contraindicated  It is reported that many women consume indigenous medicines  that contains Bryonia laciniosa  Quercus infectoria and Putranjiva roxburghii along with other ingredients  during early pregnancy to beget a male child in India 
These preparations  often called sex selection drugs  SSD  contain herbal ingredients but these are off the label prescriptions and hence cannot be certified as ‘herbal  medicines 
The prevalence of consumption varies from   to as high as         Studies have indicated that there is  –  times higher risk of birth defects including major malformations of internal organs like urogenital and renal malformation  trachea esophageal fistula  and visible defects like spina bifida  cleft lip palate and imperforate anus 
 
  Risk of stillbirths also increases   folds 
Studies suggest that a single exposure during pregnancy can be deleterious 
 
 
 
  SSDs are reported to contain phytoestrogens  steroids and heavy metals 
 
 
 
  It is also known that although placenta serves as a barrier  most drugs and environmental chemicals enter the foetal circulation by passive diffusion or active transport  However  despite growing evidence on deleterious effects of these herbal formulations  few studies have attempted to systematically understand the risk of such preparations using animal models 
Genetic sex of a child is determined at the time of conception by the fertilization of the ovum with X or Y sperms and intake of so called preparations for sex selection can never alter that In view of these  the current study was conducted with an objective to determine the embryo foetal and development toxicity of SSDs following maternal exposure during critical period of organogenesis using a small animal model The study was guided by the OECD guidelines for testing of chemicals  Guideline no    adopted on  nd January   Prenatal Developmental Toxicity Study  and was based on a mutually approved protocol 
Personal protection equipment was employed as required while handling the test system The test facility is registered and renewed  No 
 PO RcBi S CPCSEA dated July     for breeding and to conduct research on animals for commercial purpose by the committee for the purpose of control and supervision of experiments on animals  CPCSEA  Ministry of Environment  Forests and Climate Change  Government of India 
The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee  Venus Medicine Research Center 
Due permission was taken from the Ethics Committee of Indian Institute of Public Health Delhi For this experiment  strain of Sprague Dawley of rats  Rattus norvegicus  was used 
The number of dams per group was   instead of   as laid down under OECD guidelines 
Rats of both sexes  –  g  were obtained from National Institute of Biologicals  India at  –  weeks of age  acclimatized for five days and then subjected to the experiment at  –  weeks of age 
They were housed in standard polypropylene rat cages with stainless steel top grill  one dam per cage  at a temperature of       °C  with  –  relative humidity 
Bedding material and cages were changed once in six days and   hourly light dark cycle was followed 
Animals were identified by their existing ear numbering 
Cages were labelled by tags indicating the study number  sex  group of the animals  experimental start and completion dates 
Standard pelleted feed  from Ashirwad Industries  Mohali  India  was provided ad libitum to all the animals 
They also had free access to purified water via drinking bottles throughout the study 
The feed  cages and drinking bottles were not analysed for the presence of phytoestrogens and bisphenol A 
However  similar materials were used for all the rats across all groups The drug comprised of IPs for sex selection  SSD 
These non branded locally made preparations are made available  –  days after placing an order and are never sold openly 
These preparations essentially contain herbal ingredients such as Shivlingi  Bryonia laciniosa  Majuphal  Quercus infectoria  Putrajeevak  Putranjiva roxburghii  Nagkesar  Mesua ferrea  and feather of peacock  Pavo cristatus 
A total of   such samples of SSDs were procured from varied sources like ‘pansari  shop owners  grocers  local alternative medicine practitioners  rickshaw pullers  drivers and commoners from different states 
SSDs are advised to be consumed between   and   weeks of pregnancy The samples were categorized into   groups based on redundancy of the preparations and common ingredients reported 
This was followed by chemical analysis in an accredited laboratory to detect the presence of phytoestrogens and steroids 
Since we explored the toxic effects of these preparations we wanted to select two samples that would be most predictive of toxicity 
Due to resource constraints  we did not want to subject all the   samples for animal study 
Hence  three samples of SSDs  found to be most rich in phenols and steroids were selected for toxicity study  All the three samples were also tested for heavy metals which suggested that Lead and Mercury were in very high quantities  The toxicity was examined using C  elegans  an alternate animal model 
Survival analysis and reproductive toxicity was assessed from the brood size and progeny count assay  The two SSDs that were found to be most toxic were selected as test items for the subsequent study in rat models 
SSD   was reported to contain Shivlingi and Putrajeevak while SSD   contained Shivlingi  Majuphal  Putrajeevak  Nagkesar and feathers of peacock 
Both the samples were obtained from grocers 
Local preparations like these are bound to have certain degree of variability in concentrations but more often than not  these remain the major ingredients According to studies reported  women consume such preparations along with cow s milk in dosages and schedule that are quite varied 
While some advise these IPs to be consumed for one day  others prescribe it for   days  to be taken thrice a day 
We considered the amount of SSDs most commonly reported by pregnant women  weighing   kg  which was  –  g daily for   days 
The dose of the test item   mg kg  was calculated by using conversion factor of  Conversion factor is the ratio of the correction factors  estimated by dividing the average body weight in kgs of species by the body surface area in m  of the species  Km 
Human equivalent dose  HED in mg kg    Animal dose  mg kg  X correction factor  Km animal Km human 
Kms of every species are constant 
For humans it is    assuming average weight of adults to be   kg a surface area of   m  and for rats it is  Therefore  HED   mg  kg    animal dose X  
Or  animal dose         mg kg           mg kg Since pregnant women consume these orally  these were administered to rats by oral route The test items were coded as SSD   and SSD   and were provided to the experimental laboratory  Venus Medicine Research Center  Baddi  in powder form 
On the day of dosing  the doses were administered between  –  h  The test items were administered in fresh cow s milk at a final volume of   ml kg 
The doses were calculated on the basis of the latest body weight recorded for the study 
A stainless steel gavage cannula fitted to a calibrated syringe was used for dosing the animals For control animals  cow s milk was used as a vehicle while feeding The study was performed in two phases to evaluate the effect of SSD consumption duration during gestation period Adult  nulliparous female rats were mated with males of same species and strain in  
Each morning  dams were examined for the presence of a vaginal plug and vaginal smear was taken from each dam by using pipette smear technique 
The day of vaginal plug formation or sperms observed in vaginal smear  also known as successful mating  were considered as GD   Gestation day  
The mated females were housed individually in clear polycarbonate cages with stainless steel wire lids 
Mating process was carried out to result in   pregnant animals per group 
Successfully mated females were randomized into control and treatment groups 
All the rats were sacrificed on GD  
According to OECD guidelines  the test chemical should be administered daily from implantation to the day prior to scheduled caesarean section in order to assess toxicity 
Test chemicals were administered to pregnant animals and sacrificed as per the schedule  which was as close as possible to the normal day of delivery without risking loss of data resulting from early delivery i e GD  
The females were killed  before caesarean section  the uterine contents were examined  and the fetuses were evaluated for soft tissue and skeletal changes The pregnant rats were randomized to two intervention and one control groups 
SSD was given during pre implantation to implantation stage  GD  – 
Each group of rats was treated either with vehicle  G  VC  SSD   G    mg kg  or SSD   G    mg kg SSDs were given from GD  – 
Each group of rats was treated with either vehicle or SSD  or SSD 
Allocation of animals was randomized to the following groups  G   Control  VC  G   SSD    mg kg  G   SSD    mg kg  G   SSD    mg kg  G   SSD    mg kg  G SSD    mg kg  G   SSD    mg kg The following parameters were observed •Clinical Signs  Animals were observed once after successful mating or on GD  and after administration of the first dose 
Cage side observations for clinical signs of toxicity in the animals were recorded once daily until the day before necropsy •Body weight  Body weight of all experimental animals were recorded once before mating  initial body weight  and then after confirmation of mating 
Body weights were recorded on days               and on terminal day before sacrifice 
These recorded body weights were used for calculating the dose volume to be administered •Food consumption  Food consumption was evaluated once after successful mating or on day   of gestation  the day of vaginal plug formation or sperms observed in vaginal smear  and on days             and one day prior to sacrifice 
Calculated amount of feed were placed in the trough of each cage and the quantity of feed remaining after approximately   h were weighed and recorded •Morbidity Mortality  All the animals were observed twice daily  once in the morning between   and   h and once in the evening between   and   h  for incidence of morbidity and or mortality •Maternal examination related parameters  At the end of the observation period  all the dams were sequentially euthanized  by CO  asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation  and subjected to gross necropsy 
After termination  dams were examined macroscopically for any structural abnormalities or pathological changes 
Blinding was done while evaluation of the dams during caesarean section and subsequent foetal analyses to minimize bias 
Pregnancy rate was calculated as the proportion of mated pairs that had produced at least one pregnancy within a fixed period where pregnancy was determined by the earliest available evidence that fertilization has occurred 
Gestation index was calculated to indicate number of females with live born as a proportion of number of females with evidence of pregnancy •Examination of uterine contents  Immediately after termination  the uteri were removed and the pregnancy status of the animals ascertained 
Gravid uteri including the cervix were weighed  and number of corpora lutea were determined 
The uterine contents were examined for numbers of embryonic or foetal deaths and live foetuses 
The degree of resorption was described in order to estimate the relative time of death of the conceptus 
Any increase in the number of resorption and or implantation loss is an indicator of litter size for the individual dam •Examination of foetuses  The sex and weight of each foetus were determined 
Approximately one half of each litter were prepared and examined for skeletal alterations from selected dams 
The remainder were prepared and examined for soft tissue alterations  using accepted or appropriate serial sectioning methods or careful gross dissection techniques 
Each foetus was examined for external alterations 
Foetuses were examined for skeletal alterations  using Alizarin Red S staining method 
The fetuses for skeletal staining were kept in pre labelled plastic containers containing   ethanol before staining 
After skinning  we processed the foetus for staining by immersing in   alcian blue   GX for three days  then performed rehydration through a gradient series of ethanol   ethanol   –  h twice    ethanol   –  h  ethanol   –  h  distilled water until the samples sank to the bottom of a conical tube 
Samples were further treated with   KOH for  –  days or until it became clear and again treated with   alizarin red for next  –  days until bones became purple 
Samples were rinsed   times in   KOH  for  –  h at each time point 
Samples were further treated with a gradient series of glycerol  KOH    h   glycerol   h X  Visceral examination was done by micro dissection technique 
Fetuses were preserved in   formalin until they became fixed 
An illuminated magnifier was used for visceral examination 
We placed the foetus in a supine position on a paraffin wax block tray covered with paraffin wax  secured the fetal limbs by paper pins to the paraffin wax block  made a ventral midline incision from the umbilicus  cutting caudally to the genital tubercle and cranially to the diaphragm 
Once incision was completed  we located the ventral attachment of the diaphragm and lifted the liver carefully to examine the diaphragm for abnormal opening 
After observation  the diaphragm was clipped 
We gave a longitudinal cut to open the rib cage slightly lateral to and on the right of the sternebrae and then extended the cut anteriorly to neck region 
The rib cage was opened gently and secured to the paraffin block petridish tray with pins Foetuses were examined for soft tissue alterations  e g 
variations and malformations or anomalies  using Wilson s Technique 
The fetal viscera were examined sequentially  beginning with thoracic organs and moving caudally 
We performed hearts cuts after completion of other observations 
We examined the bilobed thymus for size  shape  coloration and presence of haemorrhages and then removed it for observation of trachea and esophagus 
We observed the lungs for size  color and number of lobes  observed the trachea  esophagus for normal alignment and presence of fistula  opened the pericardial sac and cut off pericardium to expose the heart for observation 
We checked the size  shape  color of the heart and normal development of major blood vessels 
After observation of thoracic viscera  we observed the abdominal viscera and liver for size  shape  color  texture  and number of lobes 
External anatomy of heart was examined by making two incisions using micro dissecting scissors We examined the stomach  spleen  pancreas  small and large intestines for size  position or any other developmental anomalies 
The intestines were moved aside after observation for seeing the underlying structures 
Ureters were checked for normal size and location and for continuity from the renal hilus to the urinary bladder 
One kidney was cut transversely and another was longitudinally to examine renal papilla and renal pelvis 
To confirm the sex of the foetus  the gonads were inspected carefully 
We examined the reproductive organs for size  shape and location GraphPad Prism® statistical software version   was used to analyze the data and all the results were represented as mean   S E M 
Intergroup variance for most of the parameters was calculated by one way analysis of variance  ANOVA  followed by Tukey s test 
A value of p     was regarded statistically significant 
Linear regression was performed to examine the weight change of dams during pregnancy for each group comparing with the control after adjusting for the litter size 
The malformations were analysed by performing Chi square test for trend for two groups  SSD  G  G  G  G  and SSD  G  G  G  G The ARRIVE guidelines were followed to report the findings 
In phase   pre natal study  all the dams dosed with SSD  and SSD  had normal food intake and weight gain 
The average gain in weight from GD  to GD   was       gms for controls while it was       gms in SSD   and       gms in SSD 
 Webtable  
No test item related mortality or clinical sign of toxicity was encountered during the study 
All dams in treatment groups and control group survived to scheduled terminal sacrifice 
They showed normal behaviour until euthanized 
There were no differences in mean maternal body weights  body weight gains  pregnancy rate  gestational index  pre and post implantation loss  and resorptions 
No significant differences were observed in foetal sex ratio  foetal body weights 
However  one dam from SSD  had all male foetuses 
No abnormality was detected in skeletal and visceral examination In phase   controls and SSD  and SSD  treated dams exhibited a comparable food intake  Table  
 
However  a dose response relationship was observed with reduced weight gain with higher doses of SSDs 
 Table  
 
Two dams  one in G   SSD    mg kg  and the other in G   SSD    mg kg  categories showed decreased or consistent body weight GD  onwards 
On an average  the weight on GD   was       gms in controls while it was       with SSD    mg kg  and       gms with SSD    mg kg 
The adjusted analysis indicated that except in G  there was a significant reduction in weight gain in all the intervention groups as compared to the control group after controlling for litter size  Table  
 During follow up  one dam from SSD    mg kg  and one from SSD    mg kg  showed haematuria during gestational day  – 
However  no another clinical sign of toxicity was encountered during the study 
All the dams in treatment and control groups showed normal behaviour and survived to scheduled terminal sacrifice 
In phase   pregnancy rate and gestational index were found to be   at all dose levels with SSD  whereas  in SSD  it decreased to   in G   SSD    mg kg  and G   SSD    mg kg  groups 
One dam from G   SSD    mg kg  and another one from G   SSD    mg kg  group showed mating confirmation during vaginal smear examination and showed positive sign in initial days of pregnancy but during necropsy on expected day of delivery  GD   no foetus was found 
Body weights of dams increased in the initial stages that became constant at a later period 
To reconfirm it  non gravid uterus was stained in salewski strain and presence of conceptus was found 
This indicated the possibility of miscarriage Increased pre and post implantation losses as well as resorptions and reduced live foetuses were observed with both SSD  and SSD 
No significant differences were observed in foetal sex ratio  but decreased foetal body weights were noted in both sexes 
On an average one early resorption in a group was a normal observation 
More than one late resorption was observed in all treatment groups while there was none in the control group 
Total count of live foetuses count was significantly reduced with SSD  and SSD  treatment in a dose dependent manner 
Total number of live foetuses were reduced up to   in SSD  at   mg kg treatment group and   in SSD  at   mg kg treatment group Both SSD  and SSD s at different dose levels showed decreased fetal weight in dose dependent manner  although the difference was not significant 
Skeletal and soft tissue alterations were observed in both treatment groups 
In general  the embryo–foetal examination showed abnormalities  which could have caused some functional damage to these foetuses if allowed to grow in the normal course 
In visceral examinations  slight dilation of the renal pelvis  reduced papilla size  urinary bladder hypertrophy was observed in few foetuses from both SSD  and SSD  treatment groups 
Few incidences of foetal soft tissue abnormalities encountered in this study were normal variants 
Skeletal examination showed variations in the ossification patterns like incomplete or poorly ossified skulls  ossification of sternebra  cleavage ossification of thoracic centrum  asymmetric thoracic centrum  and supernumerary rib in many foetuses in SSD  and SSD  groups  Table  
 
A trend was noted with increased incidence of certain malformations with increasing dosages of SSDs that was statistically significant for most malformations with SSD The results of this developmental toxicity study suggest that administration of SSDs to pregnant rats had significant impact on intrauterine foetal growth  early and late resorption as well as developmental anomalies 
These formulations have teratogenic potential but does not affect sex ratio IPs contain phytoestrogens like diadzein and genistein  In vitro rat whole embryo culture assay  WEC  studies of genistein in rats have indicated fetotoxic and teratogenic potential at concentration of ≥  μg mL  However  in vivo  an oral  gavage  embryonic and fetal development pilot study could not demonstrate any teratogenic effect in the same study 
These findings are different from our study probably because we used SSDs containing natural herbal and non herbal ingredients unlike those studies where synthetic genistein was used 
In both the studies  decreased body weight was observed indicating slight maternal toxicity 
Food consumption was unaffected in our study which is contrary to what was reported 
In another study  pregnant rats exposed to oral isoflavones  diadzein and genistein in varying combinations  showed alterations in the number of live foetuses  lysed foetuses  number of resorption sites  and implantation sites while no clinical signs suggestive of maternal toxicity  seizures  tremors and salivation  that was observed similar to our study 
Maternal mass gain was significantly reduced in rats treated with   mg kg of isoflavones  Ratio of females to males in the litter of different groups was similar akin to our finding  These observations clearly nullify the claim that consumption of SDDs could alter the sex of the growing foetus 
An analysis done by the same authors earlier revealed that SSDs contain testosterone and steroids 
 
  The prenatal testosterone in pregnancy is known to affect sexual development adversely      The principles of reproductive biology state that the genetic sex of an individual is determined at the time of conception and can never be altered under any circumstances 
However  phenotypic sex of the growing foetus is likely to be influenced by the hormonal milieu of in utero environment 
Our analysis was confined to phenotypic sex only and hence it is difficult to state if any differences existed with reference to genetic and phenotypic sex 
This requires further inquiry Evidence on the effects of SSDs on humans should best be obtained from human beings 
The findings of the current study corroborate well with the evidence generated from observational studies in human beings      Presence of skeletal and visceral malformations could explain why stillbirths are likely to be more in women who consume SSDs 
The dosing of the test drugs was intended not only to examine the period of organogenesis solely but to assess effects from preimplantation  through the entire period of gestation to the day before caesarean section 
The results were based on observations of more than   female animals with implantation sites at necropsy that added to its strength 
Unnecessary handling of pregnant animals as well as any stressors from outside was avoided 
At least three dose levels and a concurrent vehicle control were used with dams randomly allocated to different treatment groups that support the validity of the results 
However  absence of   rats per group does not support it to be a fully OECD compliant study 
We did follow the principles of Good Laboratory Practices  GLP  but due to constraints of resources the study could not be conducted as a GLP compliant study  though this is optimal for academic interests There is a lack of systematic approach to assess the safety and effectiveness of herbal preparations 
Ingredients for herbal medicines are often drawn from different sources and are used in combination  which may exhibit variability in terms of species  growing conditions  and biologically active constituents 
To isolate each active ingredient from each herb and then to establish its toxicity is time consuming  resource intensive and not practical 
Moreover  drug approval process does not accommodate undifferentiated mixtures  Though important  it surpasses the herb herb interaction and the potentiating effect of one compound over another 
Therefore  in our study  we administered the herbal mixture to assess the effects 
Real time evaluations have yielded important observations for several herbal drugs especially related to pregnancy 
For instance  Wang et al 
  used mice model to evaluate the adverse pregnancy outcomes after maternal exposure to the herbal medicines  particularly during early pregnancy  The major events included maternal and perinatal mortality 
Maternal weight gain  embryo growth and post natal weight gain were significantly decreased 
Moreover  foetal resorption and skeletal malformations were increased  signifying potential toxicity of Chinese herbal medicines 
This is comparable to our findings To conclude  the results of this developmental toxicity study suggest that administration of SSD  and SSD  to pregnant rats exerted significant impact on intrauterine foetal growth and development without any effect on sex ratio when administered during the period of organogenesis 
The prenatal exposure of SSD  and SSD  at dosage level of   mg kg day and   mg kg day during gestational days  –  to female rats had demonstrable effect on maternal or embryo foetal toxicity and teratogenicity SBN and AG conceptualized the study  AS and DD developed the study protocol and conducted the experiment  analysed the data and interpreted the findings

It is therefore natural to expect that the distribution of amino acids  across all protein sequences  would appear to be fixed  given no mutations over a specific period of time 
Of the   naturally occurring amino acids  each seems to appear randomly located at a particular position within the sequence of a protein 
However  when the sequences of a group of proteins are compared to one another  specific patterns begin to emerge 
These patterns are commonly referred to as motifs and frequently produce similar structural elements and in many cases  similar functions between the proteins that contain them 
In recent years  significant efforts have been made to reduce sequences into discrete motifs  so that each can be linked to some specific biological function based on particular rules      
Databases that consist of identifiable amino acid motifs  such as PROSITE  Pratt and EMOTIF  have been constructed to allow researchers an easy classification of unknown proteins into families based on their common motifs               
All of these methods share one property  they depend on specific alignment algorithms  such as the basic local alignment search tool  BLAST or PSI BLAST  to perform the sequence comparison between diverse families of proteins being analyzed      
These methods have already led to a number of key discoveries and offer the promise of determining biologically meaningful information about function from a protein s primary sequence It is generally accepted that a strong correlation exists between a protein s amino acid sequence and its resulting structure and function         
Techniques that can quickly determine significant similarities between protein sequences are valuable in predicting an unknown protein s function within the cell 
Here we describe a procedure that  by computing the frequency of key amino acid pairs  can quickly classify large groups of proteins into functional groups 
In order to uncover any relevant amino acid strings  we have utilized statistical methods applicable to datasets with large fluctuations in the search of human protein sequences within both the Swiss Prot and Complete Human Genebank databases The goal of this manuscript is to demonstrate how these two residue motifs can be used to develop rapid methods for searching protein or genomic databases in order to locate potentially interesting or aberrant protein sequences 
As an example  we describe the distribution of select amino acid pairs within the genome of the Coronavirus  Tor  which is responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome  SARS    
We have examined additional sets  but the limited format of this paper precludes a large presentation of potential applications The set of all   naturally occurring  amino acids are described by their standard single letter representations  and are taken as the complete set contained within all protein sequences as shown below Zq A R N D C Q E G H I L K M F P S T W Y V Residues that are arranged in a certain order can be referred to as vectors and are represented symbolically as b n b b bn bj Zq The coordinates of each vector represent the amino acid symbols contained within any given protein  where n is the total length of the vector 
The collection of all vectors b n  in the proteome can therefore be denoted simply by Zq n The underlying structure of a protein sequence  which is the order of the amino acids  has unique and identifiable characteristics 
As an analogy  in written English  the letter q is almost always followed by u 
Also  the frequency of the word  and  is much higher than that of the related three letter strings   nad   nda   dan  and  dna  which are simply permutations of the same set of individual letters to construct a word with a different meaning 
Utilizing similar characteristics  we can intuitively scan for unique sequence vectors contained within any given protein 
We expand on these characteristics  by utilizing the concepts of affinity and order stability in Section  Using the entire Swiss Prot database  release number   as the basis for our calculations  we have constructed a probability table for the occurrence of the   naturally occurring amino acids  see Table  
    
In addition to the Swiss Prot database  we have also included data from Complete Human Genebank  NCBI Build Number   March    as a source for all characterized and hypothetical human protein sequences We use the symbol Ω to denote the Swiss Prot database  and the letter M to denote the number of proteins in the database  
Hence we can state that Ω As s M  where As a a as Ns  is the sth protein  ai with i Zq is the ith amino acid in the sequence  and Ns is the length of the protein sequence As 
For any vector b n  if there is a sequence As in Ω such that b n  is a segment of As  then we can say b n  occurs in Ω 
We can then use NΩ b n  to denote the total number of outcomes that b n  has occurred in Ω  and let NΩ n  be the total number of all vectors occurring in Ω with length n  Therefore p b n NΩ b n NΩ n is the probability that the vector b n  occurs in Ω 
We then introduce k p q b n log p b n q b n where p b n  and q b n  are any two probability distributions on Zq n  and b n  belongs to Zq n 
The quantity k p q b n  in Eq 
  is defined for any two probability distributions p b n  and q b n  on Zq n  where the distribution q arises from independent letter  i e  amino acid  probabilities 
Then  k p q b n  can be viewed as a random variable about b n  and its probability distribution is defined as follows F p q x PI k p q b n ⩽x b n k p q b n ⩽xp b n The expectation value μ p q  and variance σ p q  of p b n  are expressed mathematically as μ p q b n Zq n p b n k p q b n 
 σ p q b n Zq n p b n k p q b n μ p q  Hence we see that μ p q  is simply the Kullback–Leibler entropy   
As a consequence  μ p q  is always non negative and μ p q  if and only if p b n q b n 
As a result  the amino acid sequence of b n  can be represented by k p q b n In Eq 
  the probability distributions p  q in the k p q b n  have several possible values 
For example  if we let p be the probability of b n  and only change the value of q in k p q b n  we obtain the following expression q b n j np bj p b p b p bn Based on Eqs 
  and   the value of k p q b n  gives us the affinity for all amino acids within vector b n 
Here two situations are identified as especially interesting i When k p q b n  implies that among the amino acids in vector b n  there is an increased affinity 
That is  the vector b n  occurs more frequently than expected 
 ii When k p q b n  implies that among the amino acids in vector b n  there is a decreased affinity 
That is  the vector b n  occurs less frequently than expected In a similar approach to the condition described above  we may choose q b n p πn b n  where πn b n  is a permutation of b n  and πn denotes a permutation transform 
In this case  the order sensitivity of b n  can also be reflected by the value of k p q b n  and produces the following outcomes i when k p q b n  implies that b n  occurs much more often than πn b n ii when k p q b n  implies that πn b n  occurs much more often than b n In addition to the concepts of affinity and order sensitivity  we can also design other analysis techniques by choosing alternate representations of q b n 
Quantifying the terms k p q b n  we can represent vector frequency numerically 
In cases where k p q b n μ p q ⩾ σ p q  the corresponding vector b n  is called  positive  while in those cases where the opposite takes place  k p q b n μ p q ⩽ σ p q  the vector b n  is called  negative 
By judiciously choosing a   equal to   we obtained   two residue  positive pairs  and   two residue negative pairs  see Table  
  out of a total of   possibilities of amino acid pairs Using any one of the positive motifs from Table   we can develop a test method to detect changes in their distribution through any protein database 
If b b b  is  positive  then p b b μ σp b p b  where p ⋅  is the probability of the amino acids or vectors ⋅ in the database 
Since NΩ μ M Nμ p bj NΩ bj μ MNμ we have NΩ b μ M Nμ μ MNμ μ σp b NΩ b or NΩ b μ M Nμ μ MNμ μ σp b NΩ b and since μ M Nμ is very close to μ MNμfor Swiss Prot database we have NΩ b μ σp b NΩ b and NΩ b μ σp b NΩ b As a consequence of Eq 
  the detection of a deleterious mutation based on the increased appearance of an arbitrary string of these residues becomes possible 
For example  according to Table   CC is an attractive motif with   then NΩ CC μ σp C μ M Nμ μ MNμNΩ C ≈ μ σp C NΩ C Let Ns CC  and Ns C  be the number of CC and the number of C in the sth protein 
Then we have NΩ CC NΩ C  because μ σ  and p C  since NΩ CC s MNs CC NΩ C s MNs C Based upon the result that the CC pair represents a rare event  proteins satisfying Ns CC Ns C  as defined in Eq 
  suddenly become interesting 
We can therefore consider the number Ns CC  as an index to develop detection methods to test for the presence of a CC containing protein within a database 
Using this same reasoning  one can also use any other one of the remaining motifs in Table   to develop detection methods for additional proteins In an identical fashion to the previous example using the positive two residue motifs in Table   we can also use any of the  negative  two residue motifs to develop search methods 
For example  the CM pair is a  negative  two residue  word  with  
That is  p CM μ σp C p M 
Using identical arguments to those described in Section   we obtain NΩ CM NΩ M  and NΩ CM NΩ C 
Since both Ns M  and Ns C  are small numbers for fixed proteins  the overall number of CM pairs in most proteins should be close to zero 
Therefore  we can also use any of the remaining seven  negative  motifs in Table   to develop additional detection methods In contrast to the CC motif  the total number of proteins in the Swiss Prot database having more than one CM pair is quite small 
For example  among the   proteins contained within this database  the number of proteins such that Ns CM ⩾  is   and the number of proteins satisfying the condition Ns CM ⩾  is only  
For human proteins in Swiss Prot  the total number of proteins containing CM pairs is   and there are only   proteins that satisfy Ns CM ⩾   Table  
However  we would expect to find about   proteins having CM pairs in the Swiss Prot database  based upon the amino acid frequencies given in Table   which is greater than the number observed Cysteine rich proteins and the presence of CC pairs in proteins are both concepts that have been studied previously      
If we combine these two concepts and describe them in mathematical terms  we observe that the rates q Ns C Ns and q Ns CC Ns C  describe these two conditions  where Ns  Ns C  and Ns CC  are the numbers of all amino acids  cysteine  and CC  respectively 
We can then derive proteinsNs C Ns p C σ Ns CC Ns C p ξτ C ξτ C σ where σ  and σ  are the standard deviations about Ns C Nss Mand Ns CC Ns C s M respectively We have found the following computational results based on Swiss Prot database σ ≈ σ ≈ andp ξτ C ξτ C ⩾ p C For   we have a much simpler method to determine that a protein sequence is both C  and CC rich if proteinsNs C Ns ∩proteinsNs CC Ns C So  a much simpler method to test whether a protein is a both C  and CC rich for   isNumber of CC  Number of C Number of C  Length of protein Using this principle  we found a total of eight proteins that are both C  and CC rich within the Swiss Prot database For   there is an easier method to determine whether a protein sequence is both C  and CC rich if proteinsNs C Ns ∩proteinsNs CC Ns C So  a much simpler method to test whether a protein is both C  and CC rich for   is based on the inequalitiesNumber of CC  Number of C Number of C  Length of protein Using this principle  we can get a total of   proteins that are both C  and CC rich within the entire Swiss Prot database For   there is also an easier method to determine if a protein sequence is both C  and CC rich sequence when proteinsNs C Ns ∩proteinsNs CC Ns C So  a much simpler method to test whether a protein is both C  and CC rich for   is based on the inequalitiesNumber of CC  Number of C Number of C Length of protein Using this principle  we have identified a total of   proteins that are both C  and CC rich within the Swiss Prot database 
From these results  it becomes clear that there are many C rich proteins and many CC rich proteins that are not mutually inclusive 
The sets of both C  and CC rich proteins are only subsets of the set containing all C rich proteins or that containing all CC rich proteins Because the Swiss Prot database is somewhat biased to those proteins that are of interest to researchers  we have decided to examine a database that was  in essence  complete 
For this  we chose the human subset sequences contained within the Complete Human Genebank database 
This was the most complete and readily available source of human genetic sequences and should therefore provide us with an accurate representation of both CC and CM pair distributions 
We observed that the total number of CC pairs within the human subset of sequences contained in Genebank  a total of   proteins  was  
These pairs were contained within a total of   proteins  Table   a number that is substantially larger than the   we obtained from Swiss Prot data  Table  
Since the total number of amino acids in The Complete Human Genebank is   we can easily get the expected number of CC in Complete Human Genebank is   which is much less than this actual value  
The same also holds true for the CM pair  where we would expect to see   CM pairs  but actually observe    Table  
 
This result is surprising but true and shows that there are fundamental difference between the Human and other species in terms of the frequency of CC and CM pairs To create a single CM pair  it is obvious that one needs only a single C  If a protein sequence also contains a CC pair  the total number of cysteines available to create a CM pair has been reduced by a factor of  
Using the cutoff value of four CC pairs as statistically significant  we determined the probability of finding a CM pair within proteins that already contained a CC pair  Table  
Even though both CC and CM can occur in the same protein  the total number of proteins in Genebank that contain both CC and CM pairs is   and these pairs almost always occur at different locations in the sequence 
However  in some rare cases the second C within the CC pair is shared with the first C within the CM pair  giving us a new triplet CCM If we filter the set of proteins described above for redundant entries  we obtain a set of   unique proteins that contain the CCM triplet in the human proteome 
Using the probability distributions obtained from Swiss Prot  we obtained the probability of CCM as  
Since the total of all protein lengths in the Swiss Prot database is   there should be a total of   CCM triplets 
This value is almost identical to the predicted number of CCM of  
This result suggests that the CCM triplet at least in Swiss Prot occurs randomly 
However  we can also analyze the CCM probability using a different approach  putting q CCM p CC p M  into Eq 
 
If CCM occurs randomly  then we have p CCM p C p C p M  and since p CC μ σp C p C  we will get k p q CCM log p CCM q CCM log p C p CC ⩽ μ σ Based on Eq 
  it is clear that the presence of a CC pair strongly excludes M  Therefore  the probability of the CCM triplet should occur less frequently than that of CC or M individually We have obtained the following statistical results with regard to the total number of CC and CM pairs contained in the Swiss Prot database i The total number of these proteins satisfying Ns CC ⩾  is   and   of these are found in humans 
 ii The total number of human proteins in Ω that satisfy Ns CC ⩾  is  
 iii The total number of the proteins in Ω that satisfy Ns CM ⩾  is     of these are found in humans 
 iv The total number of human proteins in Ω that satisfy Ns CM ⩾  is only  
The genome of the SARS associated Coronavirus contains a total of   open reading frames  which code for six characterized and five uncharacterized proteins   
After examining the complete proteome the SARS associated Coronavirus we observed a statistically significant increase in the occurrence of the CC and CM pairs in the SARS associated Coronavirus  genome Of the   putative proteins  four contain either CC or CM pairs 
Two large poly proteins  GI  and GI  contain   CC and   CM pairs  as well as   CC and   CM pairs  respectively 
The putative spike glycoprotein  GI    contains   CC and   CM  while the small envelope protein  GI    contains only   CC pair 
The remaining   proteins  of which two have been identified as a nucleocapsid and matrix protein  contain no CC or CM pairs 
When compared to the occurrence of CC and CM pairs within all human proteins found in the Swiss Prot database  it becomes clear that there is an increased occurrence of these pairs within the SARS associated Coronavirus proteome It is clear that the frequency of CC and CM pairs is significantly higher in the SARS genome than it is in the human genome 
It is our hope that these unique two residue motifs could be used as a means of identifying a virus such as SARS 
While currently impossible to determine  one can see a possible clinical use for determining the frequency of CC or CM pairs in an individual 
If a person has been infected by SARS  we would expect the numbers of CC and CM pairs to be much higher than in a healthy individual 
If we were then able to develop a clinically feasible technique that could identify the CC or CM pair content in total cellular protein  without damaging the cell  it could be possible to implement a detection method simply by counting the numbers of CC or CM pairs in all proteins examined 
If the presence of increased CC or CM pairs was indicative of infection by SARS we could develop new drugs to inhibit the translation of proteins that contain these pairs within infected cells 
As a very specific example  this could be accomplished through the use of specific tRNA mimics that could block translating ribosome when these pairs appear at the P and A site simultaneously      
While tRNA mimics could normally be seen as non specific protein synthesis inhibitors  the lower frequency of the CC or CM motifs in host proteins as compared to the relatively high occurrence in viral protein provide a starting point for the analysis of treatments using methods such as these In this paper we have performed a detailed search of the Swiss Prot and Complete Human Genebank database in relation to the frequencies of each of the   natural amino acids and motifs made up of two residues 
This has provided us with a new insight into the distribution of proteins within these databases and the information that may be contained within a protein s primary amino acid sequence 
Our focus in this quest has been to examine specific pairs or triplets of residues and use probability theory to assess whether or not particular strings of residues occur more frequently than their probability would indicate 
By analyzing affinity and anti affinity  we developed a procedure to search out all two  and three residue clusters within these databases 
Through this technique  we can rapidly classify large groups of proteins into families based on the occurrence of these motifs 
Combining this concept with a specific knowledge of protein function  we propose novel ideas aimed at developing fast detection methods for specific diseases based on the unusually high occurrence of some of these motifs when compared with the expected probabilities 
A timely example of the application of this method is given  namely the analysis of the SARS virus 
This method will hopefully lead to the discovery of new diagnostic techniques and possible treatment of diseases  by recognizing the location of target domains in the expressed sequence Cell type specific expression of the putative SARS CoV  receptor ACE  in human heartsThe coronavirus disease    COVID  caused by SARS CoV  infections imposes a major threat for the world s healthcare systems and is leading to thousands of deaths 
Angiotensin converting enzyme    ACE  has been identified as a potential receptor for SARS coronavirus  and is also considered the main receptor for SARS CoV  SARS CoV  binds to ACE  via its glycosylated outer membrane spike proteins 
ACE  is highly expressed in the lung and heart  and is known for its vital role in the cardiovascular system –  Although SARS CoV  mainly invades alveolar epithelial cells  it can also cause myocardial injury  as assessed by increased troponin T and NT proBNP levels accompanying increased cardiovascular symptoms in COVID infected patients  It is unclear whether elevated biomarkers of cardiac injury  or long term effects on the cardiovascular system  are directly caused by viral infection of cardiac tissue or are secondary to hypoxia and systemic inflammation 
However  patients with underlying cardiovascular disease represent a significant proportion of the patients who may suffer from a severe course after COVID  infection  This situation may be aggravated by findings showing that ACE inhibitors  which are often used to treat cardiovascular diseases  augment the expression of the SARS CoV  receptor ACE  in lung cells  This is probably mediated by an effect on angiotensin II  which is known to reduce ACE  expression  Thus  ACE inhibition decreases angiotensin II  leading to an indirect up regulation of ACE  The effect of angiotensin II receptor blockers  ARBs  which primarily target the angiotensin receptor   is unclear 
One may speculate that ARBs indirectly reduce ACE  levels by augmenting free angiotensin II levels  which in turn is expected to down regulate ACE  via activating the angiotensin receptor  
However  the effect of the two different treatments on the expression of ACE  in the heart requires further investigation Therefore  we used single nuclei RNA sequencing to determine the expression of ACE and ACE  in the different cell types of the human heart 
Gene expression signatures were detected in cardiac tissues of five patients with aortic stenosis  AS  and two patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction  HFrEF   Figure  A  and compared with with samples of one healthy donor heart  age    years  male  that was not used for transplantation 
After single nuclei RNA sequencing  data were pooled  and unsupervised clustering was performed with a total of     nuclei 
We found   distinct clusters 
Using cell type specific gene markers  major cell types were annotated  including cardiomyocytes  six clusters  fibroblasts  one cluster  endothelial cells  three clusters  leucocytes  two clusters  pericytes  one cluster  and smooth muscle cells  one cluster   Figure  B–D 
ACE  was expressed in cardiomyocytes  Cluster   and   and mural cells  particularly pericytes  Cluster   and was detected at a lower expression level in fibroblasts  endothelial cell  and leucocytes  Figure  D 
Comparison of ACE  in a pooled analysis of nuclei of the different groups showed that ACE  was significantly elevated in cardiomyocytes of patients with heart disease compared with healthy controls  Figure  E 
ACE  was also slightly  but not significantly  increased in endothelial cells  and the expression was lower in fibroblasts of patients with heart disease compared with healthy controls  Figure  E 
Immunostaining confirmed an increased expression of ACE  in cardiomyocytes of patients with aortic stenosis  Figure  F 
In addition  ACE was augmented in cardiomyocytes of patients with AS and HFrEF  Figure  G 
Interestingly  cardiomyocytes of patients who were treated with ACE inhibitors showed a significantly higher ACE  expression compared with ARB treated patients  Figure  H 
Moreover  patients treated with ACE inhibitors had an imbalance of ACE to ACE  expression  with a more than four fold higher ACE ACE  ratio compared with healthy control cells  Figure  I In conclusion  these data provide novel insights into the cell type specific expression and regulation of ACE  in the heart 
Patients with varying heart disease aetiology show augmented expression of ACE  levels particularly in cardiomyocytes 
Treatment with ACE inhibitors tends to be associated with increased ACE  mRNA and unfavourable ACE ACE  ratios  which are believed to be a driver of cardiovascular pathologies  This study is limited by its small sample size and therefore is only hypothesis generating 
However  these novel data suggest that it will be important to monitor SARS CoV infected patients for cardiovascular complications and assess the impact of ARB ACE inhibitor therapy 
Conflict of interest  none declared New onset acute symptomatic seizure and risk factors in coronavirus disease   A retrospective multicenter studyIn December   pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus  later called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus    SARS‐CoV‐  was first reported in Wuhan  China 
On March     the World Health Organization  WHO  declared the syndrome caused by SARS‐CoV‐  infection  coronavirus disease    COVID‐  a pandemic 
According to a WHO Situation Report of April    
 
 there are   confirmed COVID‐  cases and   deaths globally 
COVID‐  affects people of all ages 
 
  
 
 and in severe cases  it may cause dyspnea  hypoxia  acute respiratory distress syndrome  and septic shock 
 
  
 

The current situation has raised concerns regarding whether people with epilepsy have a higher risk to be infected with COVID‐  and whether people would develop acute seizures during the course of COVID‐ 
The objective of this study is to clarify the incidence and the risk of acute symptomatic seizures during acute COVID‐  infections This retrospective multicenter study was approved by the ethics committee of West China Hospital  Sichuan University  approval   
The study was conducted in   officially designed hospitals in Hubei province  the epicenter of the COVID‐  epidemic in China  Sichuan province  and Chongqing municipality 
These hospitals included the East Branch of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University  West China Ward  Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital  and hospitals in Sichuan province designated by the government to treat COVID‐   see the list of hospitals in Appendix S People with COVID‐  who were discharged from or died in the participating hospitals between January   and February     were consecutively enrolled 
All cases were diagnosed according to the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for COVID‐   trial version  
 
 All those enrolled tested positive through nucleic acid detection 
Disease severity was classified as mild  moderate  severe  or critical according to the national guidelines  see Box   for classification criteria 
 
 For our study  we aggregated severe and critical cases into a single severe group  whereas mild and moderate cases were aggregated into a single milder group 
The clinical outcome at discharge was either cured or death Electronic medical records of all enrolled cases were reviewed by   neurologists using a standard case report form  Appendix S 
Data were extracted on demographic characteristics  medical history  complications  treatments  and presence of risk factors for seizures 
These risk factors were considered to be the following  acute cerebrovascular disease  traumatic brain injury  TBI  central nervous system  CNS  infection  shock  hypoxia  severe metabolic disturbance  based on criteria from the International League Against Epilepsy
 
  multiple‐organ dysfunction syndrome  sepsis  and exposure to drugs or toxic substances Continuous variables were presented as median  interquartile range  and categorical variables as n  All of   people discharged from or who died at participating hospitals were consecutively identified and enrolled 
Most were from Sichuan province  n     followed by Chongqing  n     and Hubei  n    Ten individuals died  giving case fatality rates of    n     in Hubei     n     in Chongqing  and    n     in Sichuan 
Of the   severe cases      received mechanical ventilation  and     were given sedatives 
Apart from the effect of sedatives  mental state was relatively normal in   people 
Eight were encephalopathic  one was obtunded  one was delirious  and six were comatose 
The diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus was not made in any of these cases based on clinical presentation  results of investigations  or response to therapy 
No routine or long‐term electroencephalogram  EEG  was recorded due to exposure concerns None in this cohort had a past history of epilepsy 
None had any seizures  including febrile seizures  or status epilepticus during hospitalization 
Seizurelike events were seen in two people  it was believed that this was the result of an acute stress reaction in one and hypocalcemia in the other The first was a  ‐year‐old woman who reported bilateral bodily spasms lasting for about   minute  with mouth deviation but no impairment of awareness 
She was evaluated neurologically and psychiatrically and was diagnosed with an acute anxiety disorder  which was treated with olanzapine  paroxetine  and diazepam The second case was a  ‐year‐old woman who displayed bilateral myoclonus in the limbs with no impairment in consciousness   hours after admission 
Although this was initially suspected to represent seizures  she was found to have an electrolyte disturbance including hyponatremia  hypokalemia  and hypocalcemia  and the myoclonus resolved with correction of the metabolic disturbances Eighty‐four   cases reported systemic or direct brain insults that increased their risk for acute symptomatic seizures  Table  
The most common risk factor was hypoxia 
No severe electrolyte disturbance was seen  but hypokalemia  n       hyponatremia  n       and hypocalcemia  n       were frequently seen in the cohort 
Urea  creatinine  and serum glucose levels were moderately altered in most of cases 
In two cases who had chronic kidney dysfunction  substantial increases in creatinine levels were noted 
Results of investigations are shown in Table  
One case with TBI had an epidural hematoma  cerebral contusion  and skull base fracture 
Five people with severe COVID‐  experienced septic shock 
Three other cases of shock had hypovolemia or cardiac problems 
Ninety‐four   were given antibiotics  moxifloxacin  n       piperacillin sulbactam sodium  n       and third‐generation cephalosporins  n       were most commonly used We found no new onset seizures or status epilepticus in a large cohort of people hospitalized during the acute phase of COVID   infection despite a substantial proportion having risk factors for acute symptomatic seizures 
This is useful information  given the prior lack of knowledge about seizure risk during the acute phase of infection No individual in this cohort had a history of epilepsy prior to hospital admission 
To date  there is not much information available on people with epilepsy during the COVID‐  crisis 
There is one report of epilepsy in a case COVID‐  from Wuhan 
 
 As information is limited  it is not possible to establish whether this was a patient who had a history of epilepsy or whether the patient presented acute seizures 
There is at this time little if any evidence indicating that people with epilepsy are at an increased risk of COVID‐  infection 
A major challenge for people with epilepsy in this outbreak is nonadherence with the prescribed antiseizure medication  which was seen during the in SARS endemic in  
 
 This indicates the need to ensure the availability of supplies of medications and to advocate patients  self‐management 
Possible strategies for coping could also include online consultations and telemedicine networks Although many neurological and systemic disorders regarded as potential triggers
 
 of acute symptomatic seizures were identified in this cohort  seizures and status were not seen 
Stroke is one such risk factor 
The risk of developing acute symptomatic seizures after stroke ranges from   to  
 
 Acute cerebrovascular disease is considered a major cause of seizure and status epilepticus 
An earlier study from Hubei
 
  
 
 also reported six people with COVID‐  who had acute cerebrovascular disease without seizure 
Infection of the CNS can also give rise to seizures 
Although there is limited evidence of the presence of the SARS‐CoV‐  in the cerebrospinal fluid  CSF  the co‐occurrence of tubercular meningitis
 
 had been reported  with no seizure or status observed 
To determine whether COVID‐  can cause direct CNS insults requires further follow‐up 
In the earlier outbreaks of another coronavirus  a generalized convulsion with a positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for SARS‐CoV in CSF was reported  which could have been a coincidence 
 

Disturbances of homeostasis may lead to acute symptomatic seizures 
Hypoxia  the most common complication in our cohort  may trigger anoxic encephalopathy  particularly in refractory hypoxia 
Electrolyte disturbances as seen in COVID‐  are considered to be potential causes of acute symptomatic seizure 
 
 The severity and speed of such disturbances may affect onset of seizures  so these parameters should be carefully monitored The cytokine storm syndromes
 
 behind severe infection may cause the production of inflammatory cytokines systemically  with the consequence of acute toxic encephalopathies 
Although sepsis is a common cause of encephalopathy in intensive care medicine 
 
 hypoxia appears far more often than sepsis in COVID‐ 
There was also a high rate of septic shock in the COVID‐  population  varying from  
 
 to   in earlier studies in Hubei 
 
  
 

Certain antibiotics have been associated with symptomatic seizure 
 
 Antibiotics were used in a large number of people in our cohort without problems  but the most used antibiotics in the cohort were of low or moderate risk 
Clinicians should keep this seizure risk in mind when prescribing antibiotics  especially for people with renal dysfunction 
 

Our study has several limitations 
First  as a cross‐sectional study  we only have data from the acute phase of the disease 
A follow‐up study is underway to evaluate longitudinal seizure outcomes 
Second  the retrospective study design meant that we could not collect data on all relevant variables  for example  EEG was not recorded  so subclinical seizures could have been missed 
As all health care costs of COVID‐  treatment are covered by the government  all those suspected of infection are screened 
This may assure the objectivity and reliability of study materials  and it will allow for a future follow‐up study Our analysis suggests that COVID‐  poses minimal risk for seizures during the acute illness  although a significant proportion of severely ill individuals have risk factors that may increase the propensity to experience seizures 
These risk factors should be promptly addressed to minimize the risk of developing seizures 
Prospective long‐term studies must be done to determine whether people who have suffered from COVID‐  have an increased risk for developing seizures or epilepsy in subsequent months or years as a consequence of their illness None of the authors has any conflict of interest to disclose 
We confirm that we have read the Journal s position on issues involved in ethical publication and affirm that this report is consistent with those guidelines Decreased prealbumin level is associated with increased risk of mortality in hospitalized elderly patients with COVID The coronavirus disease    COVID  epidemic is caused by an infection with a novel coronavirus  officially named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus    SARS COV 
The infection spread rapidly on all continents and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization 
As of April       documented cases were reported worldwide  and   patients had died 
As there are currently no specific treatments and medications against the new virus  it is crucial to identify risk factors of severe prognosis Older patients have poorer prognostic factors and are more likely to experience critical disease 
 
 
Based on recent statistical data of China  among patients who were   years and older  the mortality rate was   which was significantly higher than that of younger patients at  
The proportion of deaths over   years old accounts for   of the total deaths in the national wide  which implicates aged people are more vulnerable to the SARS CoV 
Till present there are rare reports in literature focusing on the risk factors for poor outcomes of the elderly patients with COVID Serum prealbumin  known as transthyretin  its levels may be lowered not only by malnutrition  but also by inflammation and aging 
 
 
Compared to albumin  prealbumin has a shorter half life  a more rapid rate of hepatic synthesis  and predictable catabolic rate  hence  it may be a more sensitive indicator 
However  whether prealbumin could be an independent predictor of mortality in hospitalized COVID  elderly patients needs to be further elucidated The present study aims to describe the clinical characteristics and to investigate whether the prealbumin can serve as a valuable predictor of in hospital mortality  which might provide evidence for the risk stratification in elderly and help to improve the clinical practice and reduce fatality We designed this study as a retrospective cohort study design 
The elderly patients with COVID  who were admitted to Tongji Hospital in Wuhan from January   to February     were consecutively included 
This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Tongji Hospital  Approval Number  TJ IRB  and was complied with the Declaration of Helsinki 
The data were anonymous and the study was observational  so the informed consent was not gathered 
A flow diagram illustrating patient selection was described in Figure  
 
Inclusion criteria included elderly patients  ≥   years old  diagnosed with COVID  infection 
A total of   participants have been obtained 
Patients having missing baseline or outcome data  died on admission or being transferred to other designated hospitals during hospitalization were excluded 
There were   patients were included in the final analyses Data collection of participants was performed using hospital electronic medical record system 
Information included medical history  demographic data  physical examination  and hematological  biochemical  radiological and microbiological evaluation results were reviewed 
The data collection forms were reviewed independently by   researchers  CL and LYY 
Blood examinations were assessed at the central laboratory of Tongji Hospital following standard operative procedures 
The routine blood test was analyzed using Sysmex XE  hematology analyzer  Sysmex  Kobe  Japan 
The Cobas C   Roche  Mannheim  Germany  was used to measure the biochemical parameters 
Coagulation tests were detected by STA R MAX coagulation analyzer  Diagnostica Stago  Saint Denis  France 
Throat swab samples were collected and were tested for SARS CoV  with commercial real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  RT PCR  kit from DAAN GENE  Guangzhou  China 
The diagnostic criteria and all clinical procedures in this study followed  Diagnosis and Treatment of Pneumonia Caused by New Coronavirus  Trial version   to   promulgated by the National Health and Health Commission of China Summary statistics of baseline characteristics of all patients and stratification by prealbumin tertiles were expressed as frequency and proportion for categorical variables  mean   standard deviation  SD   Gaussian distribution  or median  range   Skewed distribution  for continuous variables  and as percentages for categorical variables 
The differences between groups were analyzed using the χ   categorical variables  One Way ANOVA test  normal distribution  or Kruskal Whallis H test  skewed distribution We examined the relationship of the prealbumin as categorized into tertiles with the outcomes of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation 
Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to evaluate these relationships  then unadjusted and adjusted odds ratio  ORs  and   confidence intervals  CIs  were calculated 
Model   is the minimally adjusted model with only sociodemographic variables adjusted 
Model   is the fully adjusted model with covariates including age  sex  smoking status  history of hypertension  history of coronary heart disease  history of diabetes  history of chronic kidney disease  history of carcinoma  history of chronic liver disease  neutrophil  lymphocyte  prothrombin time  activated partial thromboplastin time  d dimer  alanine transaminase  aspartate aminotransferase  total bilirubin  blood urea nitrogen  creatinine  C reactive protein and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio 
We calculated odds ratio  ORs  and   confidence intervals  CIs 
The highest tertile was the reference for prealbumin 
We performed test for linear trend by entering the median value of each category of prealbumin tertile as continuous variable to examine the possibility of nonlinearity To ensure the robustness of our results  we also performed stratified analyses with the prealbumin as a continuous variable for the overall population and stratified by gender  age  hypertension status and coronary heart disease status at baseline 
Generalized additive models were used to visually confirm the relationship between prealbumin as continuous variable and the risk of outcomes  all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation Modeling was performed with the statistical software packages R  http www R project org  The R Foundation  and EmpowerStats  http www empowerstats com  X Y Solutions  Inc  Boston  MA 
P values less than    two sided  were considered statistically significant In our study    cases were excluded 
To avoid selection bias due to missing data  we performed a sensitivity analysis 
The results showed that there was no statistical difference between missing group and non missing group  supplemental table  Of   elderly inpatients included in the final analysis  the mean age was     years  ranging from   years to   years  and most patients were male  table  
 
The baseline characteristics of these included participants were listed in table 
The day of sample drawing after admission was       day 
No significant statistical difference in sex  smoking status  body weight  BMI  comorbidity  hypertension  coronary heart disease  chronic kidney disease  cerebral vascular disease  carcinoma  chronic liver disease  symptoms  fever  cough  headache  diarrhea and myalgia fatigue at admission  were detected across different groups of prealbumin  tertile 
When compared with subjects in the highest tertile  those in the lowest tertile were older  more likely to have diabetes medical history  with higher Neutrophil count  lower lymphocyte count  worse coagulation function and liver function 
A total of     patients required mechanical ventilation      patients admitted to intensive care unit and     patients died during hospitalization 
The incidence of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation were significantly decreased across prealbumin tertiles  all cause death    vs    vs    for tertile   vs  tertile   vs  tertile   ICU admission    vs    vs    for tertile   vs  tertile   vs  tertile   mechanical ventilation    vs    vs    for tertile   vs  tertile   vs  tertile   respectively To investigate the correlation between prealbumin and in hospital outcomes  we constructed three models using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models  table  
 
In the unadjusted model  the ORs of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation was significantly increased as the prealbumin tertiles downgraded 
The OR for tertile   was significantly higher than the OR for tertile    OR       CI    to   P   for all cause death  OR       CI    to   P   for ICU admission  OR       CI    to   P   for mechanical ventilation 
Additional adjustment for the demographic variables and comorbidities did not reduce the ORs for the association between prealbumin tertiles and in hospital outcomes 
Further adjusting for the baseline levels of blood examinations  including blood routine  neutrophil  lymphocyte  neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio  coagulation function  prothrombin time  activated partial thromboplastin time  d dimer  liver fuction  alanine transaminase  aspartate aminotransferase  total bilirubin  renal function  blood urea nitrogen  creatinine  and infection indicators  C reactive protein  did not affect the relationships in the fully adjusted models  OR       CI    to   P   for all cause death  OR       CI    to   P   for ICU admission  OR       CI    to   P     for mechanical ventilation 
Therefore  lower tertile of prealbumin exhibited an increased risk of worse in hospital outcomes  full adjusted P for trend for all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation  P     P   and P     respectively Generalized additive models  Fig  
A through  C  were used to visually assess functional relationships between the prealbumin as continuous variate and the risk of in hospital outcomes 
Serum prealbumin was found to have negative linear relationship with the risk of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation To determine the consistency of the relationship between baseline prealbumin as a continuous variable and in hospital outcomes  we conducted stratified analyses  Table  
 
For each unit increase of prealbumin  the adjusted OR for all cause death was   in males  P     and   in females  P    
The adjusted OR for all cause death for persons less than   years of age was    P     compared with    p     for persons   years and older  P interaction    
For each unit increase of the prealbumin  the OR for all cause death was    P     and    P     for normotensives and hypertensives     P     and    P     for non diabetic and diabetes respectively 
The difference of interaction was not significant between two groups  P interaction         and   stratified for gender  age  hypertention and diabetes respectively 
Moreover  the relationship between baseline prealbumin with ICU admission and mechanical ventilation stratified by gender  age  hypertention and diabetes are consistent In this study  we found that lower serum prealbumin significantly associated with an increased risk of worse outcomes and all cause death during hospitalization 
Patients in the lowest tertile of prealbumin were older  and with higher Neutrophil count  lower lymphocyte count  worse coagulation function and liver function compared with subjects in the highest tertile 
Then we adjusted relevant covariates including age  sex  smoking status  comorbidities  neutrophil  lymphocyte  coagulation function  liver function  renal function and C reactive protein to minimize the potential impact of confounding 
Compared with crude regression analyses  this association still persisted when adjusting for demographic and clinical variables in the multivariable regression analyses 
Moreover  stratified by gender  age  hypertension and diabetes  increased level of serum prealbumin was associated with the decreased risk of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation  which determine the consistency of the relationship between lowest serum prealbumin tertile and the increased risk of worse outcomes in elderly COVID  patients Several previous studies have demonstrated baseline prealbumin change in COVID  patients 
Decreased level of prealbumin was observed among COVID  patients 
Wu C et al investigated   patients with COVID  and observed that prealbumin was associated with the development of ARDS  indicating the potential value of prealbumin level on COVID  clinical ending 
Till date  no report exists on the effect of prealbumin in COVID  elderly patients High proportion of severe to critical cases and high fatality rate were observed in the elderlyCOVID  patients  and rapid disease progress was noted in the dead 
One possible explanation involves the greater potential of seniors to be in a state of inflammation  nutritional deficiency and other complications 
Prealbumin is a globular  non glycosilated protein  synthesized by the liver  and complexed with a retinol binding protein  which acts as a transporter of retinol vitamin A and thyroid hormones 
Low plasma prealbumin level has far back emerged as an earliest laboratory indicator of poor nutritional status 
 
 
In addition  prealbumin are also associated with inflammation 
Previous studies showed that in response to the inflammation  the body responds by synthesizing a large number of cytokines 
These include interleukins and tumor necrosis factors that down regulate  decrease  plasma concentrations of albumin and prealbumin 
 
 
Therefore  assay of serum prealbumin concentration is recommended by some investigators as a screening marker for both malnutrition and inflammation Elderly with low plasma prealbumin levels mean that those people are at greater risk of malnutrition and inflammatory conditions  which may lead to poor prognosis 
Malnutrition is commonly seen in hospitalized patients in both the developed and developing world  especially among elderly patients 
A review of   published studies of acute care patients reported that malnutrition incidence ranged from  –  of hospitalized elderly 
It was found that compared to non famine regions of India  experiencing famine had significantly higher influenza mortality rates during the   Influenza pandemic 
Aging  frailty  and chronic diseases are associated with impaired immune function and are compounded by immune dysregulation from malnutrition 
When immune response is dysregulated  it would result in an excessive inflammation  even death 
In the current COVID  study  it was found that elderly patients have higher levels of white blood cells counts  CRP  inflammatory cytokines and are more likely to experience critical disease than did those younger patients 
 
 This retrospective cohort study included   elderly COVID  patients  until the date of February       of patients required mechanical ventilation    of patients admitted to intensive care unit  and the total in hospital mortality was  
The mortality rate was lower than that reported by wang L et al  among elderly COVID  patients 
This may have been the reason for some patients at the date of February     are still in hospital 
Nevertheless  this would not bias the relationship between prealbumin and in hospital outcomes because of the definite observation time we set previously 
Moreover  Wuhan tongji Hospital as one of the largest third grade Class A hospitals equipped with advanced life support training and equipment may partly account for the moderate mortality The results of this study have several clinical implications and strengths 
A low prealbumin concentration can therefore be regarded primarily as a signal identifying the at risk elderly patient who would suffer worse outcomes and requires careful assessment and monitoring for whom nutritional support and Inflammation detection may be needed as part of the treatment plan 
As observational study was susceptible to various confounders  we adjusted many variables that may affect the relationship between prealbumin and in hospital outcomes to minimize potential confounding 
In addition  we tested the robustness of the results by repeating the analyses in different subgroups of gender  age  history of hypertension and history of diabetes Our study has some limitations 
First  by including patients still in hospital as of J February     the case fatality ratio in our study cannot reflect the true mortality of elderly COVID 
Second  the record of data may be affected by prehospital medication and the time interval between admission and onset 
Third  since all subjects in our study were hospitalized Chinese elderly patients diagnosed with COVID  results of this study might not directly be applied to other ethnicities and age groups In conclusion  this retrospective cohort study revealed that the prealbumin is an independent risk factor for the in hospital mortality in the Chinese COVID  elderly patients 
Nutritional support and Inflammation detection should be careful assessment and monitoring for the elderly patients with low prealbumin concentration

Recombination Every Day  Abundant Recombination in a Virus during a Single Multi Cellular Host InfectionAs increasing numbers of full length viral sequences become available  recombinant or mosaic viruses are being recognized more frequently   
Recombination events have been demonstrated to be associated with viruses expanding their host range   or increasing their virulence    thus accompanying  or perhaps even being at the origin of  major changes during virus adaptation 
It remains unclear  however  whether recombination events represent a highly frequent and significant phenomenon in the everyday life of these viruses Viruses can exchange genetic material when at least two different viral genomes co infect the same host cell 
Progeny can then become hybrid through different mechanisms  such as reassortment of segments when the parental genomes are fragmented    intra molecular recombination when polymerases switch templates  in RNA viruses     or homologous or non homologous recombination  in both RNA and DNA viruses 
Quantification of viral recombination in multi cellular organisms has been attempted under two distinct experimental approaches  in vitro  in cell cultures     and in vivo  in live hosts    
The in vitro approach  which has so far been applied only to animal viruses  allows the establishment of the  intrinsic  recombination rate in experimentally co infected cells in cell cultures   
However  it does not necessarily reflect the situation in entire  living hosts  where the frequency of co infected cells is poorly known and depends on many factors such as the size of the pathogen population  the relative frequency and distribution of the different variants  and host defense mechanisms preventing secondary infection of cells 
The in vivo experimental approach is closer to biological conditions and may thus be more informative of what actually happens in  the real world However  as discussed below  numerous experimental constraints have so far precluded an actual quantification of the baseline rate of recombination 
First  many experimental designs have used extreme positive selection  where only recombinant genomes were viable  e g    
Other studies did not use complementation techniques but detected recombinants by PCR within infected hosts or tissues    which provides information on their presence but not on their frequency in the viral population 
So far  no quantitative PCR or other quantitative method has been applied to evaluate the number of recombinants appearing in an experimentally infected live host 
Finally  recent methods based on sequence analysis inferred the population recombination rate  rather than the individual recombination rate   
While results from these methods certainly take in vivo recombination into account  there are other caveats  isolates have often been collected in different hosts sometimes in different geographical regions and sometimes the selective neutrality of sequence variation on which these estimates are based is not clearly established 
Estimates from such studies by essence address the estimation of the recombination rate at a different evolutionary scale Taken together  the currently available information indicates that no viral recombination rate has ever been estimated directly at time and space scales corresponding to a single multi cellular host infection  although this level is most significant for the biology and evolution of viruses 
This study intends to fill this gap by evaluating the recombination frequency of the cauliflower mosaic virus  CaMV  during a single passage in one of its host plants  the turnip Brassica rapa CaMV is a pararetrovirus  which is a major grouping containing hepadnaviruses  e g  hepatitis B virus  badnaviruses  e g  banana streak virus  and caulimoviruses  e g  CaMV 
Pararetroviruses are characterized by a non segmented double stranded DNA genome 
After entering the host cell nucleus  the viral DNA accumulates as a minichromosome   whose transcription is ensured by the host RNA polymerase II   
The CaMV genome consists in approximately   bp and encodes six viral gene products that have been detected in planta  Figure     
Viral proteins P  to P  are expressed from two major transcripts  namely a  S RNA  encoding P  and a  S RNA corresponding to the entire genome and serving as mRNA for proteins P –P    
Using the pre genomic  S RNA as a matrix  the protein P   product of gene V  reverse transcribes the genome into genomic DNA that is concomitantly encapsidated   The detection of CaMV recombinants in turnip hosts has been reported numerous times 
Some studies have demonstrated the appearance of infectious recombinant viral genomes after inoculation  i  of a host plant with two infectious or non infectious parental clones   or  ii  of a transgenic plant containing one CaMV transgene with a CaMV genome missing the corresponding genomic region   
While the former revealed inter genomic viral recombination  the latter demonstrated that CaMV can also recombine with transgenes within the host s genome 
Another study based on phylogenetic analyses of various CaMV strains has clearly suggested different origins for different genomic regions and  hence  multiple recombination events during the evolution of this virus   
Indirect experimental evidence has indicated that  in some cases  CaMV recombination could occur within the host nucleus  between different viral minichromosomes  presumably through the action of the DNA repair cellular machinery   
Nevertheless  the mechanism of  template switching  during reverse transcription  predominant in all retroviruses  most certainly also applies to pararetroviruses 
For this reason  and on the basis of numerous experimental data  CaMV is generally believed to recombine mostly in the cytoplasm of the host cell  by  legal  template switching between two pre genomic RNA molecules    or  illegal  template switching between the  S and the  S RNA   
Under this hypothesis  recombination in CaMV could therefore be considered as operating on a linear template during reverse transcription  with the  ′ and  ′ extremities later ligated to circularize the genomic DNA  position   in Figure  
The above cited studies clearly demonstrate that CaMV is able to recombine 
However  since these studies are based on complementation techniques  non quantitative detection  or phylogenetically based inferences of recombination  they do not inform us on whether recombination is an exceptional event or an  everyday  process shaping the genetic composition of CaMV populations In the present work  we aimed at answering this question 
To this end  we have constructed a CaMV genome with four genetic markers  demonstrated to be neutral in competition experiments 
By co inoculating host plants with equal amounts of wild type and marker containing CaMV particles  we have generated mixed populations in which impressive proportions of recombinants distributed in several different classes corresponding to exchange of different genomic regions have been detected and quantified 
Altogether  the recombinant genomes averaged over   of the population 
Further analysis of these data  assuming a number of viral replications during the infection period ranging from five to   indicates that the per nucleotide per replication cycle recombination rate of CaMV is of the same order of magnitude  i e  on the order of a few   across the entire genome 
We thereby provide the first quantification  to our knowledge  of the recombination rate in a virus population during a single passage in a single host From Figure   and supposing that all marker containing genomic regions can recombine  we could predict the detection and quantification of seven classes of recombinant genotypes   bcd a  a cd b  ab d c  abc d   cd ab  a d bc  and a c b d 
Indeed  all classes were detected  and their frequencies in the ten CaMV populations analyzed are summarized in Table  Altogether  the proportion of recombinant genomes found in the mixed viral populations was astonishingly high and very similar in the ten co infected plants analyzed  Table   last column  ranging between    plant   to    plants     and   with a mean frequency   standard error  of      
This result indicates that recombination events are very frequent during the invasion of the host plant by CaMV and represents  to our knowledge  the first direct quantification of viral recombination during the infection of a live multi cellular host The inferred per generation recombination and interference rates  assuming that CaMV undergoes ten replication cycles during the   d between infection and sampling  are given for each of the ten plants in Table  
Recombination rates between adjacent markers are large  on the order of   to  
Taking the distance in nucleotides between markers into account yields an average recombination rate per nucleotide and generation on the order of      
Interestingly  this recombination rate does not vary throughout the genome  Kruskal–Wallis test  p    To relax the assumption of the number of replications during the   d  we calculated the recombination parameters assuming five or   generations 
The effect of the number of generations on the estimates is linear  doubling the number of generations results in a halving of the recombination rate  detailed results not shown 
For example  the average recombination rates r
  r
  and r
  assuming   generations were equal to     and   respectively  compare with values in Table   yielding per nucleotide per generation recombination rates of             and      Inspection of Table   also shows that first order interference coefficients were in general negative  indicating that a crossing over in one genomic segment increases the probability that a crossing over will occur in another genomic segment  while the second order coefficient parameter had an average value close to zero with a large variance 
The mechanism leading to these results will be discussed in the following section One major breakthrough in the work presented here lies in the space and time scales at which the experiments were performed 
Indeed  the processes occurring within the course of a single infection of one multi cellular host are of obvious biological relevance for any disease 
Previous studies on viral recombination suffered from major drawbacks in this respect  basing their conclusions on experiments relying on complementation among non infectious viruses or between viruses with undetermined relative fitness  on phylogenetically based analyses  or on experiments in cell cultures 
For reasons detailed in the Introduction  the first two methods either do not provide information on the frequency of recombination  but only its occurrence  or address the question at a different temporal  and often spatial  scale 
Results from cell cultures  on the other hand  impose cell co infection by different viral variants  potentially overestimating the frequency of recombination events 
Our study circumvents these limitations by analyzing viral genotypes sampled from infected plants after the course of a single infection  and therefore the invasion and co infection of cells in various organs and tissues is very close to natural More than half of the genomes       see Table   present in a CaMV population after a single passage in its host plant were identified as recombinants  and these data allowed us to infer a per nucleotide per generation recombination rate on the order of       to      
The time length of one generation  i e  the time required for a given genome to go from one replication to the next  is totally unknown in plant viruses 
The only experimental data available on CaMV are based on the kinetics of gene expression in infected protoplasts  where the capsid protein is produced between   and   h   
The reverse transcription and the encapsidation of genomic DNA being two coupled phenomena    we judged it reasonable to assume a generation time of   d and  thus  an average of ten generations during our experiments 
In case this estimate is mistaken  we have verified a linear relationship between r and the number of generations  thereby allowing an immediate adjustment of r if the CaMV generation time is more precisely established 
At this point  we must consider that all cloned genomes may not have been through all the successive replication events potentially allowed by the timing of our experiments 
It was previously shown that about   of CaMV mature virus particles accumulate in compact inclusion bodies    where they may be sequestered for a long time  as such inclusions are very frequent in all infected cells  including those in leaves that have been invaded by the virus population for several weeks 
The viral population may thus present an age structure that could bias the estimation of the recombination rate 
In order to minimize this bias  the clones we analyzed were collected in one young newly formed leaf  where the chances of finding genomes from  unsequestered lines  were assumed to be higher 
In any case  our data analysis is conservative  since this age structure can only lead to an underestimation of the recombination rate Our results show that interferences between pairs of loci are negative  a recombination event between two loci apparently increases the probability of recombination between another pair of loci 
We believe that the most parsimonious explanation of these negative interferences is based on the way the infection builds up within plant hosts 
Indeed  one can divide infected host cells into those infected by a single virus genotype and those infected by more than one viral genotype 
In the former  analogous to clonal propagation  recombination is undetectable 
In the latter  recombination is not only detectable but  as our results indicate  very frequent 
Samples consisting of viruses resulting from a mixture of these two types of host cell infections will thus contain viruses with no recombination and viruses with several recombination events  thus yielding an impression of negative interference 
These conceptual arguments are supported by mathematical models 
It is indeed easy to show  detailed results not shown  that if a proportion F of the population reproduces clonally  analogous to single infections  while the remaining reproduces panmictically  negative interferences could be inferred even if they do not exist 
For example  assuming a three locus model with real recombination rates r
  and r
  and interference i
  the  apparent  recombination and interference parameters  would be r
        F r  r
        F r
  and i
     F   i
    F 
Interestingly  this example also shows that our estimates of the recombination rate are conservative  that a fraction F of host cells are singly infected while others are multiply infected leads to an underestimation of the recombination rate As judged by r
  r
  and r
  calculated between markers a–b  b–c  and c–d  respectively  we found evidence for recombination through the entire CaMV genome 
The values for r
 
r
  and r
  are remarkably similar  hence the recombination sites seem to be evenly distributed along the genome 
We considered the template switching model as the major way recombinants are created in CaMV 
As already mentioned in the Introduction  hot spots of template switching have been predicted at the position of the  ′ extremities of the  S and  S RNAs   
If other recombination mechanisms  such as that associated with second strand DNA synthesis or with the host cell DNA repair machinery  act significantly  hot spots would be expected at the positions of the sequence interruption     and     
Due to the design of our experiment and the position of the four markers  we have no information on putative hot spots at positions corresponding to the  ′ end of the  S RNA and to    at nucleotide position  
Nevertheless  the putative hot spots at the  ′ end of the  S RNA and at   and    nucleotide positions   and   respectively  fall between marker pairs c–d  b–c  and a–b  respectively 
Our results indicate that either these hot spots are quantitatively equivalent though predicted by different recombination mechanisms or  more likely  that they simply do not exist 
Whatever the explanation  what we observe is that the CaMV can exchange any portion of its genome  and thus any gene thereof  with an astonishingly high frequency during the course of a single host infection To our knowledge  the viral recombination rate has never previously been quantified experimentally for a plant virus   
In contrast  retroviruses and particularly HIV  have been extensively investigated in that sense 
As we have already discussed for these latter cases  the quantification of the intrinsic recombination rate was carried out in artificially co infected cell cultures 
The estimated intrinsic per nucleotide per generation recombination rate in HIV  is on the order of      less than one order of magnitude higher than our estimation for CaMV 
Because for various reasons detailed above we probably underestimate the within host CaMV recombination rate  we believe that the intrinsic recombination rate in CaMV is higher and perhaps on the order of that of HIV Other pararetroviruses such as plant badnaviruses or vertebrate hepadnaviruses have a similar cycle within their host cells  including steps of nuclear minichromosome  genomic size RNA synthesis  and reverse transcription and encapsidation 
Nevertheless  vertebrate hepadnaviruses  e g  hepatitis B virus  infect hosts that are very different from plants in their biology and physiology  and this could lead to a totally different frequency of cell co infection during the development of the virus populations 
Thus  even though our results can be informative for other pararetroviruses because of the viruses  shared biological characteristics  they should not be extrapolated to vertebrate pararetroviruses without caution We used the plasmid pCa  which is the complete genome of the CaMV isolate Cabb S  cloned into the pBR  plasmid at the unique SalI restriction site   
To analyze recombination in different regions of the genome  we introduced four genetic markers  a  b  c  and d  at the positions       and   respectively  thus approximately at four cardinal points of the CaMV circular double stranded DNA of   bp  Figure  
All markers  each corresponding to a single nucleotide change  were introduced by PCR directed mutagenesis in pCa  and resulted in the duplication of previously unique restriction sites BsiWI  PstI  MluI  and SacI in a plasmid designated pMark S  Because  in this study  we targeted the possible exchange of genes between viral genomes  all markers a  b  c  and d were introduced within coding regions corresponding to open reading frames I  IV  V  and VI  respectively 
Another important concern was to quantify recombination in the absence of selection  i e  to create neutral markers 
Consequently all markers consist of synonymous mutations  see below To generate the parental virus particles  plasmids pCa  and pMark S were mechanically inoculated into individual plants as previously described   
All plants were turnips  B  rapa cv   Just Right  grown under glasshouse conditions at   °C with a    light dark  photoperiod 
Thirty days post inoculation  all symptomatic leaves were harvested and viral particles were purified as described earlier   The resulting preparations of parental viruses  designated Cabb S and Mark S  were quantified by spectrometry using the formula described by Hull et al 
  
We fixed the initial frequency of markers to a value of   and a solution containing   mg ml of virus particles of both Cabb S and Mark S at a   ratio was prepared 
Plantlets were co infected by mechanical inoculation of two to three leaves with   μl of this virus solution  using abrasive Celite AFA  Fluka  Ronkonkoma  New York  United States 
The mixed CaMV population was allowed to grow during   d of systemic infection We designed an experimental protocol for quantifying marker frequency within a mixed Cabb S Mark S virus population after a single passage in a host plant 
Twenty four individual plants  inoculated as above with equal amounts of Cabb S and Mark S  were harvested   d post inoculation  when symptoms were fully developed 
The viral DNA was purified from   mg of young newly formed infected leaves according to the protocol described previously   
After the precipitation step of this protocol  the viral DNA was resuspended and further purified with the Wizard DNA clean up kit  Promega  Fitchburg  Wisconsin  United States  in TE  X   mM Tris HCl and   mM EDTA  pH   
Aliquots of viral DNA preparations were digested by restriction enzymes corresponding either to marker a  b  c  or d and submitted to a   agarose gel electrophoresis  colored by ethydium bromide and exposed to UV 
Each individual restriction enzyme cut once in Cabb S DNA and twice in Mark S  thus generating DNA fragments of different sizes attributable to one or the other in the mixed population of CaMV genomes 
After scanning the agarose gels  we estimated the relative frequency of the two genotypes in each viral DNA preparation and at each marker position  by densitometry using the NIH   Image program 
The statistical analyses of the frequency of the four markers are described below To identify and quantify the recombinants within the CaMV mixed populations  aliquots from ten of the   viral DNA preparations described above were digested by the restriction enzyme SalI  and directly cloned into pUC  at the corresponding site 
In each of the ten viral populations analyzed    full genome length clones were digested separately by BsiWI  PstI  MluI  and SacI  to test for the presence of marker a  b  c  and d  respectively 
In this experiment  with the marker representing an additional restriction site  we could easily distinguish between the Cabb S and the Mark S genotype at all four marker positions  upon agarose gel   electrophoresis of the digested clones 
Clones with none or all four markers were parental genotypes  whereas clones harboring     or   markers were clearly recombinants 
Due to the very high number of recombinants detected  markers eventually appearing or disappearing due to spontaneous mutations were neglected Here we present the different methods we used to quantify recombination in the CaMV genome 
Because all these methods assume that the different markers are neutral  we first discuss assumption We used two datasets to test the neutrality of markers  both resulting from plants co infected with a   ratio of Mark S and Cabb S 
The first consisted of viral DNA densitometry data derived from   plants  described above  where for each plant we have an estimate of the frequency of each marker in the genome population 
The second consisted of the restriction of   individual full genome length viral clones obtained from one co infected plant  described above  yielding an estimate of the frequency of each marker  and this was repeated on ten different plants 
The frequencies of the different markers were       and   for markers a  b  c  and d in the first dataset and       and   in the second dataset 
We tested whether these frequencies were significantly different from the expected value under neutrality    using either t tests  for datasets where normality could not be rejected  seven out of eight cases  or Wilcoxon signed rank non parametric tests otherwise  marker c in the first dataset 
In all cases p values were larger than  There are several cautionary remarks regarding these analyses 
First  in all cases we found an excess of markers 
Unfortunately  the two datasets cannot be regarded as independent because  even though the methods through which the frequency estimates were obtained were different  the plants used in the second dataset were a subset of the plants of the first 
We thus have only four independent estimates in each case  and there is minimal power to detect significant deviations from neutrality with such a small sample size 
It should be noted at this stage that deviations from the expected value could also be caused either by slight deviations from the   ratio in the infecting mixed solution  or by deviations from that ratio in the frequency of the viral particles that actually get into the plants 
Second  because of the relatively small sample sizes and low statistical power  the tests presented above could have detected only large deviations The results clearly show  however  precisely that the markers do not have large effects  if any  and that therefore recombination estimates would be affected only very slightly by any hypothetical selective effects of the markers 
Because of this  along with the fact that the introduced markers provoke silent substitutions in the CaMV genome  we assumed that markers were effectively neutral in the rest of the analysis The dataset used to estimate the recombination frequency consisted of the   full genome length viral clones   from each of ten co infected plants  individually genotyped for each of the four markers 
As discussed in detail in the Results  recombination was very frequent and concerned all four markers 
Indeed  approximately half of the genotyped clones exhibited a recombinant genotype 
It was therefore meaningful to try to obtain quantitative estimates of recombination from our data Our aim was to analyze viral recombination in a live host 
Consequently  we had to deal with the fact that more than one viral replication cycle occurred during the   d that infection lasted in our experiment  we had to wait that long for the disease to develop and to be able to recover sufficient amounts of viral DNA from each infection 
Based on the kinetics of gene expression    we postulate that each replication cycle lasts between   and   d  and that therefore seven to ten cycles occurred between infection and the sampling time 
In case this assumption is incorrect  we did calculations assuming five  seven  ten  or   replication cycles during these   d  As shown  the results were not affected qualitatively  and only slightly quantitatively 
It is important to note that we assumed that recombination occurred through a template switching mechanism  and that therefore  from a recombination point of view  the CaMV genome is linear 
The reverse transcription starts and finishes at the position   in Figure   which is the point of circularization of the DNA genome 
This implies that changes between contiguous markers a–b  b–c  and c–d can be considered as true recombination whereas those between a and d cannot  as they may simply stem from circularization of DNA  during the synthesis of which the polymerase has switched template once anywhere between a–b  b–c  or c–d To estimate the recombination rate between markers  we wrote recurrence equations describing the change in frequency of each genotype over one generation  assuming random mating and no selection  i e  the standard Wright–Fisher population genetics model 
We then expressed the frequency of all possible genotypes n generations later as a function of their initial frequency and of the recombination parameters 
Subsequently we calculated the maximum likelihood estimates of the recombination parameters and their asymptotic variances given initial frequencies  we assumed that the two  parental  genotypes  Mark S and Cabb S  had equal initial frequencies of   and that all other genotypes had initial frequencies of zero  and frequencies after n generations  the observed frequencies  as stated above we used different values of n 
All algebraic and numerical calculations were carried out with the software Mathematica The recombination parameters are the recombination rates between two adjacent loci  e g  r
  for the recombination rate between markers a and b  and the interference coefficients  e g  i
  for interference between recombination events in the segments between markers a and b and b and c  To define these parameters we followed Christiansen    and in particular the recombination distributions for two  three  and four loci  respectively  Tables     and   of   
It is important to realize that given the definitions of these parameters  the estimator of the recombination rate between two loci is not affected by the number of loci considered 
In other words  we obtain the same estimation of the recombination rate between markers a and b whether we consider genotypic frequencies at just these two loci  or the frequencies at these two loci plus a third locus  or the complete information to which we have access  the four marker genotypes 
Information on additional loci only affects the estimates of the interference coefficients It proved impossible to carry out the calculations for four loci algebraically 
Instead  we used a computer program to calculate the expected genotypic frequencies at all four loci after n generations  given the above stated initial frequencies and specified recombination parameters 
For each combination of recombination parameters we calculated a Euclidean distance between the vector of the expected genotypic frequencies and the observed genotypic frequencies  and considered that the estimated recombination parameters were those yielding the minimal Euclidean distance 
In all cases  the estimated recombination rates between pairs of loci were equal to the second decimal to those estimated algebraically from data for three or two loci Tumor Restrictions to Oncolytic VirusIn most solid tumors the tumor interior displays a high cellular density with multiple cell types  both malignant and normal  stromal  cells  interdigitated by strands of extracellular matrix  ECM  and other poorly defined tissue 
Stromal cells typically consist of fibroblasts  macrophages  neutrophils and other immune cell types 
Tumor associated fibroblasts are a source of the bulk acellular tissue in tumors    which is largely made up of polysugars and glycoproteins  such as collagens  laminins  fibronectins  proteoglycans  hyaluronan and water  forming a dense matrix around and between the cancer cells   
This matrix provides structural support but also haptotactic and chemotactic guidance for cancer cells   
Moreover  the prevailing tumor interstitium is rich in soluble angiogenic factors  such as members of the vascular endothelial growth factor  VEGF  family    cellular growth factors  including endothelial growth factor  EGF  basic fibroblast growth factor  FGF  platelet derived growth factor  PDGF  and pleiotrophic factors  particularly transforming growth factor  TGF  beta   
Additionally  both tumor  and stromal cells secrete cytokines and chemokines  such as interleukin  IL    IL   tumor necrosis factor  TNF  alpha  stromal cell derived factor  SDF    macrophage migration inhibitory factor  MIF    which on one hand recruit more stromal and progenitor cells into the tumors and on the other hand curb the activity of antigen presenting cells and anti tumor T cells   
In several independent cancer types  high serum levels of IL   and IL   are indicators of poor prognosis   Aberrant tumor and stromal growth combined with an overproduction of matrix leads to high interstitial pressure in the tumor  preventing lateral diffusion of therapeutic compounds within the tumor 
Tight cellular compactness combined with a high tumor proliferation rate also causes physical crowding and puts constraints on oxygenation  which due to aberrant angiogenesis and rupture of the haphazard vessels is mostly incomplete and results in chronic tissue hypoxia toward the tumor cores 
As cancer cells exist in a crowding hypoxic  and cytokine growth factor perpetuated chronic state of stress  they upregulate a number of key cellular molecules that function as a collective defense against a wide range of therapies  including oncolytic viruses 
The properties of oncolytic viruses and their status in clinical development as well as various delivery options have been reviewed elsewhere   
In this review  we provide an overview of two of the main intratumoral barriers to oncolytic virus spread  the extracellular tumor make up and the intracellular antiviral defense mechanisms Tumor cellular structure and composition may in concert with abundant extracellular matrix  ECM  deposition pose a severe hurdle for systemic virus entry and propagation of infection within the tumor 
The extracellular matrix is a complex dense network consisting of multiple proteins  glycoproteins and polysaccharides including collagens  laminins  fibronectins  proteoglycans and hyaluronic acid   
The interstitial fluid pressure  IFP  in the tumor surrounding blood and lymphatic vessels is mainly created by the high cell density that forms an increased physical pressure outwards and does not allow free diffusion of therapeutics   
A high IFP generally predicts an aggressive tumor phenotype as tumor cells tend to escape from tumor margins where the pressure drops  thus facilitating spread of metastatic cells   
On the other hand  for therapeutic virus  interstitial fluid concentration gradients may pose a hurdle as passive diffusion in viable regions  typically the rim  may occur mainly outward   
Given the limited arsenal of known chemicals alleviating tumor compactness and the poor penetration drugs in general into the tumor tissue  this is a considerable problem that may not be easy to tackle 
Some strategies are discussed below Viruses are passive particles and rely either on radial cell to cell spread or on soluble diffusion across concentration gradients to reach their target cells and to propagate the infection 
Tumor matrix is critical in this regard  as it can block both forms of spread 
Passively diffusing viruses may physically not fit through the strands of the ECM 
This was shown for oncolytic herpes virus  which has an outer diameter of over   nm  and whose spreading could be improved by matrix degrading bacterial collagenase co injection   
Bilbao and coworkers showed that adenovirus entry into experimental hepatocellular carcinoma nodules in the livers of immunocompetent rats following intravenous or intraportal injection was directly related to the thickness of the ECM capsule enveloping the nodules   
On the other hand  we found using Semliki Forest virus  which has an outer diameter of about   nm  that even upon intratumoral injection spread was blocked by ECM  which formed a physical barrier for virus infection  Figure  The foremost option to reduce interstitial fluid pressure and to remove physical molecule barriers imposed by the ECM is to use matrix degrading enzymes 
These act by digesting collagen  fibrin  and other types of fibrillar matrix deposits  creating more space between cell clusters  and glycosaminoglycan polymers  known to limit fluid movement in tumors 
Simultaneously  such strategies may also expose more cell surface to viruses  increasing the likelihood of infection 
In a study by Kuriyama  trypsin or collagenase dispase was injected into subcutaneous U  and U  glioma xenografts in immunocompromised mice  followed by a reporter adenovirus   
Both types of ECM degrading enzymes increased tumor transduction by the virus  but when doses got too high  transduction efficacy suffered  demonstrating a balance between ECM degradation and oncolytic virus efficacy 
In another study  treatment of PC  tumors with vaccinia virus producing matrix metalloprotease  MMP    resulted in reduction of collagen IV fibrils and increase in virus penetration into tumor  which yielded elevated virus titers   
Hong et al 
targeted orthotopic neuroblastoma xenografts engineered to express MMP  with oncolytic HSV  achieving increased virus distribution compared to control tumors   
Similar results were obtained when human soft tissue sarcoma HSTS T overexpressing MMP  or MMP  were injected with oncolytic HSV   
MMP expressing tumors contained significantly less sulfated glycosaminoglycans compared to control tumors 
Other enzymes and protein effectors  either engineered into virus expression cassettes or provided exogenously  include hyaluronidase  decorin  various other MMPs  and notably relaxin a peptide hormone normally expressed during particular phase of pregnancy that does not possess tissue degrading activity itself  but instead induces a number of key collagen degrading proteases seemingly in a tumor specific manner   
Beyer showed that relaxin expressed by murine stem cells improved trastuzumab penetrance and therapy outcome in syngeneic tumor models   
In another study  chimeric adenovirus Ad  expressing relaxin showed increased tumor transduction and virus dissemination   Several other strategies to increase penetration of therapeutics in tumors have been developed   
While the stromal ECM capsule of tumor nodules acts as a physical barrier to virus entry following intravenous injection  it was possible to improve tumor infection by administering vaso active compounds  angiotensin II  histamine  nitroglycerine  before the virus   
This is interesting  as vasculature per se would not be expected to alter or influence the physical composition of the ECM  such as collagen strand thickness 
Instead  virus access to the tumor was improved  most likely by increased access from the blood via tumor stromal adjoining vessels 
Interestingly  in a study with oncolytic herpes virus  anti VEGF monoclonal antibody Bevacizumab given before intravenous virus injection gave poorer anti tumor efficacy than when given after the virus   
The study showed that while HSV is able to enter and infect tumors better through their leaky vasculature compared to Bevacizumab normalized vasculature  vascular normalization by Bevacizumab still gave superior combination efficacy when the virus was already in the tumor 
This effect was likely dependent on altering both physical and biological properties of the tumor  including interstitial pressure and oxygenation 
In another study  anti VEGF A antibody injections in nude mice harboring U  human glioma xenografts led to an increase in MMP  expression and reduction in collagen fiber content  facilitating improved distribution of oncolytic adenovirus within the tumor tissue   
In general  targeting tumor vasculature by oncolytic viruses and including agents that affect tumor vasculature in combination regimens is gaining interest    and it will be interesting to see more specific studies on how vascular acting agents may affect the physical barriers to oncolytic viruses Some viruses do not need an extracellular step for propagating infection  such as members of the herpes and poxvirus families  and may be able to spread from cell to cell 
For example  HSV  is able to infect neighboring cells via lateral tight junctions in a manner dependent on its glycoproteins E and I   
Vaccinia virus  on the other hand  induces so called actin tails  which are actin filament driven membranous protrusions of the plasma membrane harboring a single virus particle at the outer tip 
These actin tails actively deliver and deposit virus particles onto or even into neighboring cells   
Because lateral spread without an extracellular step may circumvent neutralizing immunity as well as some of the physical obstacles the tumor microenvironment imposes  this ability has been engineered into viruses that normally do not possess it 
A promising strategy is to engineer OVs to express membrane fusogenic genes  MFGs  such as gibbon ape leukemia virus  GALV  glycoprotein  reptilian reovirus p  protein  FAST  or the membrane glycoproteins H and F of measles virus   
Quite intriguingly  expression of several different MFGs by oncolytic adenovirus synergized with chemotherapy in anti tumor efficacy both in vitro and in vivo    suggesting that membrane fusion facilitated lateral spread of also chemotherapeutics  which otherwise would not have occurred in a compact tumor 
The potential limitation of cell to cell dependent spread  however  may be that membrane free physical barriers  such as the ECM  may still pose a barrier to spread 
Also  it is unclear whether MFGs or other mechanisms of lateral spread may assist in reaching distant tumor nests Some other strategies to alleviate matrix imposed restrictions to oncolytic viruses have been discussed elsewhere   Tumors of epithelial origin mostly retain the firm cellular integrity seen in their original adhesive intercellular configuration 
Several viruses use cellular receptors which are located in paracellular tight junctions  which may be problematic in tightly packed tumors   
Adenovirus C group viruses use coxsackie adenovirus receptor  CAR  as their primary entry point  whereas adenovirus B  group members and measles virus Edmonston use CD  complement binding molecule as their cellular receptor   
Adenovirus B  group  serotypes       and   entry occurs using desmoglein   DSG    
Of these  CAR and DSG  are preferentially located within tight junctions and are hidden from virus binding   
Also the complement receptor CD  was ascribed a role in maintenance of epithelial cell integrity by interactions with the E cadherin catenin network   
These observations imply that before reaching the potential entry site on the tumor cell the virus must find its way into the junctional space 
Moreover  it has become increasingly clear that for example glioma tumors traditionally targeted by Ad  serotype adenoviruses often express only low levels of CAR and instead much higher levels of CD    Beyond that tight junctions hide multiple virus receptors  they contain a network of adhesion molecules  including ZO  cadherins  claudins and occludin  which  if perturbed  is associated with more aggressive disease in many types of cancer   
Since tight junctions also contain important receptors that mediate tumor promoting signaling and which have been targeted by monoclonal antibodies  notably Her  it would be highly useful to develop strategies that temporarily loosen the tight junction contacts even at cost of a transient increase in tumor metastatic risk 
One of the most interesting approaches has been to exploit the natural propensity of adenovirus serotype   which as part of its natural life cycle creates dodecahedral particles  PtDd  consisting of viral capsid proteins  penton base and fiber that open tight junctions by binding to and dissolving desmoglein  dimers and reducing E cadherin expression  to develop a specific tight junction opening molecule  JO    
Adenovirus type   uses PtDds to promote its own infection  opening the tight junctions ahead of infection to maximize access to desmoglein 
Analogously  when administered to human tumor xenografts  JO  facilitated penetration of trastuzumab much deeper into the tumor tissue than when the monoclonal antibody was administered on its own   
Moreover  JO  synergized with several chemotherapeutics in solid tumor models   
Backed by our own findings with oncolytic SFV  showing that both extracellular matrix and tumor cell compactness restrict virus spread and oncolytic efficacy  we believe combination approaches that target both tight junctions and extracellular matrix will prove effective in future virotherapy development  Figure  An alternative approach to increasing tumor penetration by oncolytic viruses is to alter tumor cell morphology and status 
Notably  cell death and in particular the type of cell death induced by virus has been shown to affect virus distribution within a tumor mass  in a study by Nagano et al  administration of apoptosis inducing paclitaxel before injecting oncolytic herpes simplex virus increased virus dissemination in the tumor  allowing its diffuse in  tunnels  created by shrinking dying tumor cells   Maintenance of physiological adherence is essential for proper ECM function and for retaining cellular integrity 
Therefore  a potential caveat of using ECM degrading proteolytic enzymes or tight junction openers is the risk of neoplastic cell detachment from the tumor ECM and increased risk of metastasis 
While ECM degradation or tight junction opening may operate innocuously  there is also a chance that loss of E cadherins via proteases or via non specific deregulation of tight junction integrity during ECM modulating therapy could trigger pro tumorigenic Wnt β catenin signaling  possibly driving epithelial to mesenchymal transition   
One study showed that ectopic relaxin expression stimulated MMP expression and enhanced breast cancer invasiveness    whereas another paper found short term relaxin exposure to increase breast cancer cell motility whereas long term expression reduced both motility and cancer invasiveness   
In the context of oncolytic viruses  Lavilla Alonso tested several proteases  including hyaluronidase  relaxin  and macrophage metalloelastase  and showed they all could assist adenovirus entry into tumors  yet  the authors did not detect treatment induced metastases or increase in tumor invasiveness   
Another strategy possibly balancing some of the putative risks of tight junction disruption could be to use Wnt dependent oncolytic viruses   Tumors are invariably fenestrated by host fibroblasts  myeloid cells and other non transformed cells  which driven by cancer induced cues can adopt various reprogrammed phenotypes to promote tumor angiogenesis and growth and to alter tumor responses to therapies   
As most of them normally play a role in immune homeostasis and pathogen sensing  they also respond to and influence oncolytic virus infection of tumors Fulci et al 
reported that injection of oncolytic HSV  directly into glioblastoma tumor parenchyma triggered upregulation of CD  and CD  monocytic markers and rapid clearance of virus  likely executed by infiltrating phagocytic cells   
When clodronate liposomes were used to deplete macrophages in vivo  the authors observed a  fold increase in virus titers in the brain tumors concomitant with an   reduction in peripheral CD  macrophages in animal spleens  suggesting that CD  cells migrate into the tumors upon virus injection and limit overall oncolytic efficacy 
While CD  cells were not reduced by peripheral macrophage depletion  arguing that these cells had been recruited to the tumors before the treatment  they could be eliminated in live glioma slices ex vivo  resulting in a  fold increase in virus replication 
Macrophages may secrete antiviral type I interferon constitutively at very low  subnanomolar  levels   and recently Liu et al 
showed that tumor resident CD  macrophages induced a protective antiviral state in ovarian and breast tumors which led to resistance to oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus  VSV  infection   
Type I IFN signaling  JAK  inhibitor Ruxolitinib reversed the resistance  facilitating VSV replication in the macrophage protected cancer cells 
It is tempting to speculate that tumor resident macrophages also rendered syngeneic GL  and DBT mouse gliomas completely refractory to VA  oncolytic alphavirus  as these cells were quite infectable in vitro and live glioma slices regained their sensitivity to virus within   h  indicating dilution of IFN I   Macrophages or the closely related myeloid suppressor cells are the predominant stromal cell type in many tumors and are actively recruited during cancer progression   
Heavy macrophage presence in the tumors indicates that such tumors may be resistant to oncolytic virotherapy  unless depleting preconditioning would be used 
Moreover  as part of the early immune response to virus infection  monocytic cells are rapidly recruited to tumors following intratumoral virus injection 
In one study  depletion of either CD b  cells or VEGF secreted by these cells in mice treated with oncolytic HSV  greatly increased oncolytic efficacy  tentatively linking pro tumorigenic and antiviral angiogenic mechanisms   Another key pro tumorigenic signaling employed by many tumors is up regulation of CXCR  the receptor for chemokine CXCL   also known as SDF  and recruitment of stromal cells expressing CXCL  which maintain the tumor and recruit additional cells to support tumor expansion and invasion  such as endothelial cell progenitors which contribute to neovascularization   
Indeed  high CXCR  expression is a negative prognostic factor for many cancers 
Oncolytic vaccinia virus engineered to express a soluble antagonist of CXCR  showed improved intratumoral virus replication  increased vascular disruption and a markedly reduced infiltration of the tumors by putative immune suppressive and tumor promoting stromal cells   
This study highlights how reducing pro tumor stromal cell effects may alleviate antiviral resistance and yield increased overall therapeutic efficacy 
On the other hand  if the paracrine antiviral effects of tumor homing monocytic cells could be selectively abrogated these cells could favorably be used to ferry oncolytic viruses into tumors 
Indeed  a significant delay in metastatic tumor potential was achieved when macrophages were harnessed to deliver a tumor specific oncolytic adenovirus   What is the antiviral status in human cancer 
Recent analyses from different normal cells that occupy the same organ reveal striking functional variation in components of the type I IFN signaling pathway that correlate with the tissue tropism and virulence of some virus strains   
Can similar variation in such components be found in cancer cells  or do cancer cells make an exception Transformed cells undergo selective elimination by the immune system before becoming cancerous  termed immunoediting  based on observations of differential capacity of immunocompetent mice to reject tumors previously grown in immunocompromised hosts versus syngeneic animals   
Cancer cell responsiveness to type I and type II IFNs plays a role during immunoediting  cancer cells that eventually progress to form a tumor display reduced capacity to respond to IFN gamma  which otherwise would upregulate MHC class I molecules and render the tumors amenable to CD  T cell mediated destruction  whereas responsiveness to type I interferon initially helps tumors avoid immune purging during the editing phase and is then irrelevant   
Of note  the anti tumor effects of type I IFN  still exploited today in several cancers  were shown to depend on host NK cells  and mice in which IFNAR was blocked by monoclonal antibody failed to reject even highly immunogenic tumors  as opposed to mice treated with control antibody  who all rejected the immunogenic tumor challenge   
Thus  whereas tumor responsiveness to type I IFN is not predetermined after immunoediting  other factors post immunoediting may influence it In several tumor types  varying levels of expression of components of the type I IFN signaling cascade have been detected  and in some tumor types these components have been found to have prognostic value  whereas in others they do not seem to influence survival   
However  emerging data suggests that antiviral genes may predict poor survival because they increase treatment resistance 
In one study  poor prognosis of several types of cancer due to genotoxic treatment resistance was found to correlate with increased activity of IFN I pathway genes   
In this study  a triad of type I IFN signaling pathway genes  STAT  ISG  and IFIT  formed a pan tumor type negative prognostic factor  and a broader seven gene cluster established negative prognostic criteria for treatment resistant breast cancer 
Treatment resistance was subsequently shown to depend on STAT  signaling  STAT expressing tumor clones were positively selected in animals in vivo  demonstrating increased proliferation and metastatic potential  and STAT expression mediated resistance against genotoxic assault by doxorubicin or ionizing radiation  knockdown of STAT  resulted in lower proliferation rate and metastatic capacity and increased sensitivity to genotoxic stress    
In another study  resistance to epigenetic DNA modifiers  AZA dC  a methyltransferase inhibitor  and LBH  or MGCD  both histone deacetylase  HDAC  inhibitors  was correlated with increased expression of IFN I pathway genes in small lung cancer cells   
Basal IFN related gene expression in several different SML cell lines was upregulated Interestingly  in many cancers  STAT proteins are not phosphorylated and persist in unphosphorylated form  U STAT 
Like its phosphorylated counterpart  U STAT  increases expression of genes contributing to resistance to DNA damaging agents   
While it is currently unknown why cancers may prefer to use unphosphorylated forms  it is known that U STATs activate distinct signals compared to their phosphorylated counterparts 
However  importantly for oncolytic viruses  in many tumors  constant expression and release of type I IFN leads to a constitutively high level of unphosphorylated forms of STAT  STAT  and IRF  which together form an unphosphorylated but functional ISGF like complex that relocalizes to the nucleus and drives expression of a specific set of ISGs distinct from acute IFN I exposure   
These ISGs are sufficient to maintain a functional antiviral defense and they play a critical role in resistance to DNA damaging agents On a cellular level  virus replication is controlled by antiviral defense molecules    which in turn are primarily controlled by type I IFN signaling 
In addition to classical type I IFN  or cytokine induced antiviral signaling  tumors may employ other antiviral defense mechanisms 
For example  stromal cells may secrete peptides with antiviral properties called defensins   
The defensins are amphiphatic and typically  –  amino acids in length and interfere with viruses by physically binding to and disrupting virus particles and or by inducing antiviral responses in target cells via pattern recognition receptors 
At least oral squamous cell carcinomas were found to overexpress defensins compared to normal control tissues   
While the role of defensins in oncolytic virus infection of tumors is unclear  one study showed that the immune stimulating properties of defensins may be exploited to increase overall therapeutic efficacy 
In this study  expression of beta   defensin from a conditionally replicating adenovirus yielded a superior therapeutic entity compared to the unarmed parental virus via enhanced anti tumor immune responses mediated by TLR dependent activation of dendritic cells   In summary  human cancers display varying degrees of expression of antiviral proteins or their signaling regulators at baseline 
Some of these may increase in response to genotoxic anti cancer treatments 
In the next chapter we will highlight some of the consequences to oncolytic virotherapy of the heterogeneity in type I IFN responsiveness in tumor cells All oncolytic viruses tested to date display variable infectivity in different cancer cell lines 
This variability is likely at least partly dependent on type I IFN as most oncolytic viruses are IFN sensitive 
IFN secretion follows virus sensing by the cells via Toll like receptors expressed on both the plasma membrane and in endocytotic vesicles  NOD like receptors  STING  AIM  NLP inflammosome and other danger sensing molecules  summarized elsewhere   
While all viruses carry an arsenal of counteracting molecules    no virus goes completely undetected 
Even HSV amplicons  which are devoid of functional virus genes  induce a type I IFN response that mediates a STAT dependent system wide antiviral defense in mice within one hour of intravenous vector injection  resulting in significant reduction of transgene expression compared to expression in STAT  knockout animals   During our own studies with attenuated SFV vector VA  it became apparent that the dramatic and lasting therapeutic efficacy achieved following mere single intravenous  or intratumoral  injection of the virus in immunocompromised mice bearing human A  melanoma or U  glioma xenografts   was not going to be recapitulated easily in immunocompetent animals   
The paradox in our studies was that while oncolytic SFV vector VA  effectively replicated in and destroyed a variety of IFN responsive cancer cell lines in vitro  it consistently failed to eradicate tumors generated from the same cell types in vivo  even if large doses of virus were injected directly into the tumor mass and even if the tumors were void of visible physical barriers  Figure  
Conversely  only tumors generated from IFN unresponsive cancer cells have seemed infectable in vivo by VA  so far 
In light of earlier findings by others  showing that type I IFN receptor knockout mice are highly susceptible to SFV infection and quickly succumb to multi organ systemic infection    the parameters for oncolytic SFV efficacy seem clear  tumor cells must be defective in type I IFN response for the virus to be effective These findings are in line with emerging data from other groups  showing a remarkably strict dependence of oncolytic virus replication on defective type I IFN responsiveness  a dogma introduced at the turn of the  st century   
For example  sarcomas and melanomas display differing permissiveness to oncolytic VSV  an obstacle which may be overcome by blocking type I IFN signaling   
In eight sarcoma cell lines  basal up regulation of RIG I and IFIT  and rapid induction of STAT  phosphorylation upon IFN I treatment correlated with resistance to oncolytic measles virus   
In other studies  human pancreatic and ovarian cancer cells display resistance against Rb dependent oncolytic adenovirus  strongly correlating with intracellular levels of MxA  and acquired resistance to repeated oncolytic adenovirus injections in an intraperitoneal ovarian carcinoma model was associated with an increase in MxA as well as several other key ISGs in the tumors   
A study comparing normal human or mouse melanocytes to a panel of melanoma cells revealed strong correlation between permissiveness to oncolytic VSV and capacity to mount antiviral defense in response to type I IFN   
In this study  VSV rp  harboring two mutations in P and L genes  was superior to several other tested oncolytic VSV strains  but the dependence on defective IFN responsiveness was still retained 
In yet another study  oncolytic VSV replicated in four out of twelve mesothelioma cell lines which were unable to mount antiviral defense upon IFN beta pretreatment or to respond to infection by up regulation of PKR  MxA or  OAS mRNA   
In contrast  the non permissive mesothelioma cells mounted antiviral defense  associated with PKR  MxA or  OAS mRNA up regulation  in response to infection or to exogenous type I IFN 
The authors of this study further linked the observed pattern of virus resistance to clinical mesothelioma samples  where in a mesothelioma tissue array  significant variance in immunoreactivity against PKR  p  and or IFNAR was observed  with only a few samples displaying lack of reactivity against all three components  arguing that most tumors in clinical settings would display at least some level of resistance to oncolytic VSV Oncolytic adenoviruses are often deleted for E A  which normally binds Rb and prevents it from sequestering E F  which results in the viruses being unable to replicate in normal cells 
However  since adenovirus  as with all viruses  contains elements that antagonize antiviral defenses  such elements have also been targets for deletion to render the virus sensitive to innate antiviral defenses  which would be expected to remain intact only in normal cells 
Cancer cells expressing Ras may down regulate protein kinase R and inhibit type I IFN induction by interfering with RIG I signaling   
Also  select interferon stimulated genes appear to be repressed by the Ras MEK ERK signaling cascade   
PKR activation shuts down E F dependent translation  including translation of virus messenger RNAs 
Therefore  an adenovirus deleted for VA RNA  which antagonizes PKR  should be capable of replicating in Ras overexpressing  tumor  cells 
However  while this was seemingly the case    it was later discovered that Ras is not an obligatory determinant for PKR inactivation and that virus replication was halted even in Ras overexpressing cells via functional PKR mediated E F phosphorylation  implying that the parameters of VA RNA deleted adenovirus replication had to be revised   
Similar findings were obtained with oncolytic reovirus  against which Ras independent tumor resistance emerged in vivo   
Thus  under some circumstances even tumor cells over expressing Ras may respond to type I IFN or to stimulants of pattern recognition receptors  activating PKR and inhibiting virus translation 
To complicate matters  MEK inhibitors have been shown restore antiviral signaling capacity in Ras overexpressing tumors   
This implies that human tumors treated with MEK inhibitors  such as Trametinib which was recently approved for treatment of BRAF mutated melanoma  may be poor targets for oncolytic viruses as antiviral signaling capacity in such tumors may be restored Some oncolytic viruses  such as members of the poxvirus family  are seemingly resistant to the antiviral effects of type I IFNs in vitro and may be controlled by other cellular factors   
However  in most cases  sensitivity or resistance to type I IFN is assessed in vitro and using only one cytokine  which may mask synergies with other factors present in vivo 
One possible explanation for the in vitro–in vivo discrepancy is the tumor micro environment  which not only imposes physical barriers to oncolytic viruses but also alters intracellular antiviral defenses 
For example  glioma cells were found in the brain to spontaneously secrete type I IFN  which conferred resistance against oncolytic HSV 
Resistance was linked to ECM protein CCN  interaction with glioma cell surface receptor alpha   beta   integrin  which activated interferon secretion   
It is tempting to speculate whether this or a similar ECM glioma interaction could have contributed to the resistance of syngeneic glioma cells we observed in vivo but not in vitro to both oncolytic SFV and vaccinia virus  FIG    
Also  while critical in many respects  antiviral signaling may occur without signaling via type I IFN receptor  IFNAR 
For instance  upon infection of IFNAR KO mice with murine hepatitis virus  MHV  brain cells were found to have upregulated antiviral GTPase TGTP and IFITm  and IFITm  all of which have confirmed antiviral activity in vivo against a variety of viruses   
In these cases  IFN gamma and TNF alpha likely account for at least part of the observed ISG activity  where e g  TGTP is upregulated by IFN γ signaling and TNFα has been shown to induce ISG  independently of IFNAR   Interestingly  while most cancers are heterogeneous in antiviral defence signaling  one broad class of tumors in particular may display consistently low capacity to ward off oncolytic viruses  oncovirus induced cancers 
This is because oncoviruses  as all viruses  carry a complement of factors that abrogate antiviral sensors and effectors  which may result in tumors that are uniformly devoid of antiviral signaling 
In an intriguing study  oncolytic VSV infected and destroyed human papilloma virus  HPV positive cervical carcinoma cells more effectively than HPV negative head  and neck cancer cells due to HPV E mediated suppression of antiviral signaling   
HPV positive or E expressing xenografts were efficiently eradicated from nude mice following VSV injection 
The potential of this approach is that even oncolytic viruses that are extremely sensitive to type I IFN  such as attenuated SFV or M mutated VSV  may function well against oncovirus induced cancers where the oncovirus machinery ensures the lack of antiviral defense While on first thought it would appear counterintuitive to antagonize the very factors that keep oncolytic viruses tumor specific  emerging data shows that this can be accomplished in a safe way 
One of the foremost strategies to increase oncolytic virus efficacy is to combine them with drugs that lower tumor antiviral defenses 
In this regard  a primary target for interference is the prototypical type I IFN signaling cascade 
While small molecular inhibitors against IFNAR are not available  activity of downstream signaling transducers may effectively be blocked 
Human pancreatic cancer cells were shown to constitutively express high levels of MxA and OAS and to mount type I IFN dependent resistance to oncolytic VSV 
Resistance could be overcome by blocking activity of IFNAR associated Janus kinase  JAK      
Similarly  JAK  inhibitor ruxolitinib overcame type I IFN dependent resistance of human SCC  head and neck cancer cells against oncolytic VSV   
Ruxolitinib also successfully abrogated type I IFN mediated antiviral effects elicited by macrophages    highlighting that this drug might also alleviate type I IFN dependent tumor resistance to oncolytic viruses imposed by stromal cells 
However  the obvious downside to using JAK inhibitors is their effects on critical host defense mechanisms  which may result in increased infection of normal cells 
Moreover  JAK inhibitors may reduce anti tumor immune responses elicited by oncolytic virotherapy 
For example  ruxolitinib was shown to impair the capacity of dendritic cells promote CD  T cell responses against model tumor antigens   
On the other hand  in this study clearance of adenovirus was delayed in ruxolitinib treated normal animals  which makes it difficult to predict the overall impact of JAK inhibitors on tumor therapy where prolonged virus presence might translate to better therapeutic efficacy 
Also  while the immune stimulating and anti tumor effects of type I and type II interferons may be adversely affected by JAK inhibitors  central tumor promoting cascades mediated by JAKs  such as IL STAT  may also be inhibited    yielding a difficult to predict net therapeutic outcome 
At the moment  more studies are needed to establish the overall impact of interference with JAK  signaling in cancer therapy Spurred by earlier reports of oncovirus reactivation and promoter enhancement by histone deacetylase  HDAC  inhibitors  this class of agents was assessed for capacity to enhance oncolytic virus potency by inhibiting antiviral responses 
Indeed  such enhancement was observed with oncolytic VSV and SFV  and while it has been difficult to pinpoint the exact mechanisms that underlie HDAC inhibitor enhancement of oncolytic virus replication in cancer cells  antiviral defenses in general are inhibited for yet unknown reasons mainly in cancer cells and not in normal cells  which indirectly facilitates virus replication   
Interestingly  combination of HDAC inhibitors with conditionally replicating   E A deleted adenovirus gave improved virus replication rate and therapeutic efficacy in subcutaneous xenograft models only when the inhibitors were given before the virus  otherwise inhibition of replication was observed   
Similarly  HDAC inhibitors increased replication and oncolytic efficacy of HSV when given before the virus but not when given at the same time   
With nuclear DNA viruses  such as adenovirus and HSV  it is possible that HDAC inhibitors also alter virus genome accessibility to transcription factors  resulting in reduced replication or other adverse effects  implying that with these viruses HDAC inhibitors should be administered before the viruses Recently  it was found that HDAC inhibitor vorinostat activates NfκB signaling by facilitating hyperacetylation of the p  subunit  which in turn activates cellular autophagy   
Autophagy was in another study shown to be important for VSV replication  presumably by inhibiting antiviral signaling 
This is interesting  as a previous study revealed enhancement of VSV replication by inhibiting TNF alpha induced antiviral signaling mediated by p  using NfκB inhibitors BMS  or TPCA    
In this study  neither inhibitor had an effect on STAT  or STAT  phosphorylation or their nuclear relocalization in response to type I IFN but the authors observed clear induction of ISG  GBP  and MX  in response to type I IFN in U  glioma cells  with the latter two being dependent on NfκB signaling 
Taken together  NfκB pathway activation may result in different antiviral responses in different cancer types  and inhibition or enhancement of oncolytic viruses by NfκB inhibitors is dependent on other concomitant cellular mechanisms  such as autophagy Since HDAC inhibitors modulate promoter activity accessibility  it is conceivable other epigenetic or promoter modifying agents could work in a similar manner to repress antiviral defense induction and enhance oncolytic viruses   
DNA demethylating agents  azacytidine  Aza  and decitabine synergized with oncolytic herpes simplex type   virus in glioma models in vitro and in vivo  as did HDAC inhibitor valproic acid  VPA  which was already shown before to work well with oncolytic HSV as well as several other oncolytic viruses   
Moreover  inhibition of cancer antiviral defenses  specifically RNAseL and PKR  resulted when cancer cells were exposed to sunitinib  a multi tyrosine kinase inhibitor originally developed as an inhibitor of VEGF R and PDGF R signaling  yielding strong anti tumor synergy with IFN sensitive oncolytic VSV   
Since sunitinib is approved for renal cell carcinoma and imatinib resistant gastric cancers  combination with oncolytic VSV constitutes a promising and clinically relevant approach warranting further investigation 
Interstingly  sunitinib as well as several other receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors displayed antiviral effects against polyomavirus BK    arguing that these compounds are not universal virus enhancers Cyclophosphamide  CPA  is a general immunosuppressant used to minimize Treg presence during immunotherapy and also oncolytic virotherapy 
CPA may  however  also enhance replication and efficacy of oncolytic viruses by diminishing cytokine secretion by stromal cells  including type I IFN   
Another compound enhancing oncolytic virus efficacy by lowering cell responsiveness to type I IFN is triptolide  which acts downstream of IRF  activation   
Further  the kinase mammalian target of rapamycin  mTOR  enhances the antiviral effects of type I IFN by activation of its effector proteins  E BP  which binds and inactivates translation factor eIF E  and S K  which carries out cell type specific signaling functions of type I IFN  such as activation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor  B and promotion of ISG  transcription 
Consequently  rapamycin was able to enhance oncolytic VSV replication and anti tumor efficacy by inhibiting type I IFN mediated antiviral signaling via mTOR   Several other compounds synergizing with oncolytic viruses have been identified via high throughput drug library screening  many of which seem to act by antagonizing antiviral defenses 
For instance  a novel virus sensitizer  Vse  was found to greatly diminish antiviral effects of type I IFN against oncolytic VSV in several cancer cell types  and the drug also synergized with the virus in subcutaneous mouse tumor models   
For many of these new compounds  the mechanism of action is still poorly understood  necessitating extensive safety studies to exclude undesirable effects against normal cells Apart from classical type I IFN induced antiviral defenses  which typically prevent virus translation and degrade virus genomes  other cellular machineries regulate oncolytic virus efficacy 
Notably  strategies to increase cancer cell death in response to oncolytic viruses have been tested 
In a recent study  a class of compounds called SMAC mimetics synergized in several cancer models with oncolytic VSV by removing cancer cell block to apoptosis in response to virus induced type I IFN  TNF α or TRAIL   
Interestingly  since virus infection triggered cytokines act on nearby non infected cells  SMAC mimetics may in combination with oncolytic viruses also cause significant bystander tumor destruction 
Normal cells are not affected by the IFN SMAC mimetic synergy  providing an important safety aspect 
In another study  blocking the ER stress response circuitry triggered by oncolytic rhabdovirus infection by a small molecular inhibitor of serine threonine protein kinase and endoribonuclease IRE α  which was identified in a genome wide siRNA screen  greatly enhanced cytotoxicity via caspase induced apoptosis and increased oncolytic efficacy in refractory tumor models in mice   
This effect was independent on induction or responsiveness to type I IFN 
Conversely  inhibitors of nucleoside transporter   ENT  were discovered from a high throughput screen of enhancers of oncolytic HSV  and to date such inhibitors have not been reported to alter cellular antiviral responses   
Other compounds  such as common chemotherapeutics  and their mechanisms synergizing with oncolytic viruses have been discussed elsewhere for most of them the possible role of antiviral defense antagonism in enhancing oncolytic virus efficacy remains to be studied   Thus  many compounds are available to interfere with tumor antiviral defenses 
The outstanding question for most of them  however  seems to be why such compounds do not render normal cells sensitive to oncolytic viruses 
Elucidation of the exact mechanisms of action and the differences between normal and cancer cells constitute a worthy goal for studies in the near future Already in the  s it became clear that using certain pathogenic wildtype viruses  such as West Nile virus and Bunyamwera virus  in cancer patients would result in off target toxicity   
Characteristic for pathogenic viruses is a greater ability to circumvent or antagonize cellular innate antiviral defenses than attenuated strains 
For example  unlike the prototypical oncolytic reovirus strain type   Dearing  the T L strain of reovirus causes accumulation of IRF  in the nucleus and inhibits activation of a select group of ISGs yet because of this property the T L strain is myocarditic unlike the oncolytic type   Dearing strain   
For these reasons  many oncolytic viruses used today  such as reovirus type   Dearing  oncolytic strains of Newcastle disease virus and M mutated VSV have either a stronger capacity to induce or a weaker capacity to resist antiviral type I IFN than the corresponding wildtype strains   An open question  however  is whether strain specific or virus specific differences that relate to specific components of the cellular antiviral machinery may be exploited for greater anti tumor efficacy  i e  if one virus fails  could another be used in its stead 
While Ras expression was critical for oncolytic reovirus replication in cells overexpressing CUG  oncogene  oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus was unable to replicate in the same cells due to increased activation of STAT  and OASL    
Thus  in these cells reovirus was not affected by STAT  or OASL  and it therefore remains interesting to see which other antiviral effectors may have been lacking in the CUG expressing cells and  conversely  how reovirus and VSV differ in terms of sensitivity to antiviral effectors 
While several oncolytic viruses have been compared to each other in terms of replication rate and cytotoxicity  systematic studies with regard to tumor antiviral defenses have not been conducted As any attenuated virus is likely to replicate effectively only in its own niche  i e  to be restricted by a specific set of ISGs  and as wild type strains may be too toxic for use in humans  a compromise may be achieved by incorporating select elements from wild type viruses into oncolytic virus backbones 
Indeed  several chimeric and recombinant viruses have been generated that harbor specific elements of wild type strains or even of other unrelated viruses in order to better resist cancer antiviral defenses  Table  
As an example of introducing wild type elements into attenuated viruses  Haralambieva reported on a measles virus Edmonston vaccine strain in which P gene was replaced with the counterpart from the wild type IC B strain   
Later  Meng et al 
included N  P  and L genes from wild type measles in Edmonston backbone  producing an enhanced but still safe oncolytic virus   
Edmonston vaccine virus induces a more robust IFN response compared to wild type measles virus partly due to the weaker ability of V protein to suppress MDA mediated activation of IRF  and IFN I induction   
In vivo  P gene encoded proteins  particularly V  control the quality of the cytokine response to measles so that vaccine strains qualitatively induce a stronger inflammatory response compared to WT strains  where WT V protein suppresses multiple cytokine secretion 
V protein short cytoplasmic tail has been shown to bind and inactivate STAT  IRF  MDA  and the Rel homology domain of the NfκB subunit p  but not of p    
Also  V causes LGP  protein to bind and inactivate RIG I    but it seemingly does not interfere with TICAM   TRIF  multiple TLR adaptor  including TLR mediated IFN β induction 
Thus  if cancer and normal cells would differ with regard to TICAM  or IRF  then such a virus could potentially target specifically cancer cells rather than normal cells 
So far  the measles Edmonston WT chimeras have proven safe in animals As an example of heterologous virus constructs  lentogenic Newcastle disease virus engineered to express influenza virus PR   H N  NS  showed enhanced oncolytic efficacy in vivo due to dampening of antiviral responses   
While such a virus did not display enhanced pathogenicity in that study  a mesogenic NDV virus harboring NS  from influenza strain H N  did show increased pathogenicity in chickens as well as an increased ability to replicate in human cells    raising some cautionary warnings for future engineering of similar replicative viruses 
As another example  vaccinia virus soluble type I IFN scavenger B R  NOTE  B R is often used in the literature  has been engineered into both oncolytic HSV and oncolytic rhabdoviruses  resulting in all cases in more effective therapy agents without loss of tumor specificity   
Oncolytic γ  gene deleted HSV was complemented by two different PKR antagonists from human cytomegalovirus  TRS  and IRS  generating a chimera capable of reaching wild type virus replication levels in cancer cells in vitro and in tumor models in vivo   The selection of various viral IFN I antagonists that potentially could be used to augment attenuated oncolytic viruses is vast   
For example  increased replication of several viruses  including HIV  Sindbis virus and E deleted adenovirus in mammalian cells was observed when the cells were engineered to express vaccinia virus E L protein  influenza A virus NS  protein  ebola virus VP  protein or HIV  Tat protein   
The choice of antagonist must primarily be made with safety in mind  but virus specific and cell specific differences in antagonist functions may potentially be exploited rationally when considering the overall combination 
For example  vaccinia virus E L is able to rescue VSV but not EMCV from exogenous IFN  whereas vaccinia virus K L partially rescued EMCV but not VSV   In anticipation of systematic  perhaps bioinformatically guided   super chimera  studies  two or more viruses that may complement each other s shortcomings in antiviral defense antagonism have been considered 
Notably  vaccinia virus was favorably combined with IFN I sensitive oncolytic VSV and SFV  yielding tumor model dependent increases in overall therapy efficacy that were dependent on vaccinia virus antagonism of type I IFN responses  which increased the replication of the IFN sensitive viruses   
Such heterologous virotherapy approaches may also be used to generate immunological synergy  similar to heterologous prime boost vaccination  anti tumor immune responses may be increased due to targeting of the tumor by two different viruses  on two separate occasions  but anti virus immune responses would be generated against different viruses each time  avoiding the problem of neutralizing immunity to and predominance of antivirus immune responses   
Some other ideas explored experimentally include engineering oncolytic viruses to express other oncolytic viruses 
For example  the entire oncolytic parvovirus H  genome was placed under a regulatable promoter in oncolytic adenovirus  resulting in a more effective therapeutic entity than either virus alone without loss of tumor specificity   
The genetic material of Semliki Forest virus replicons has been engineered into adenovirus and vaccinia virus backbones   and several other virus chimeras have been constructed   
However  the effects on tumor antiviral defenses of such a constructs remain to be studied The attribute  oncolytic  implies for a virus that it infects and  indeed  lyses the infected tumor 
This property is primarily tested in vitro in cultured tumor cells 
We have learned  however  that in the native tumor microenvironment in living hosts many viruses are no longer able to infect tumor cells or to kill them even if they manage to infect them 
Tightly packed tumor cells and the network of supportive molecules of the extracellular matrix form a physical barrier to virus particle diffusion 
It has also become evident that the tumor cells themselves may be much more capable of thwarting oncolytic virus advances than previously thought  with some tumor cells residing in a seemingly permanent non permissive antiviral state 
Tumors harbor multiple cell types in addition to the neoplastic cells  which may promote and propagate both physical and cellular virus resistance 
As the efficacy of virotherapy in human cancer patients still falls shy of the achievements in animal models  it appears quite plausible that one or more of the barriers described in this review indeed constitute a real and formidable obstacle for oncolytic virus advancement into routine clinical use 
Fortunately  some of the most difficult barriers have been identified  and a rapidly expanding arsenal of countermeasures is at our disposal 
Our task is now to separate the wheat from the chaff and to systematically evaluate the proposed combination regimens that will yield the best results without compromising patient safety Evidence of prenatal toxicity of herbal based indigenous formulations for sex selection in rat modelsTraditional or indigenous preparations  IPs  are getting considerable attention in global health debates  It continues to be used widely in several countries and its consumption is rapidly increasing 
 
  Many reports have documented the use of such preparations 
For instance  in China  traditional herbal medicines played a critical role during the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome  SARS  In fact  many drugs in modern medicine had their roots in the traditional system of medicine 
Drugs like Penicillin  from Penicillium fungi  and Digoxin  from Digitalis purpurea  are some such examples 
One of the promising therapies for Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus  MRSA  infection is a ninth century treatment for eye infections which is a recipe consisting of garlic and onions  wine  and bile from a cow s stomach brewed in a brass cauldron 
It is however important to note that culture specific practices are not always safe 
Digitalis is a classic example where herbalists use this plant in allopathic treatment strategies  while in some countries such as Britain  law restricts their vast availability  A report from Australia describes the adverse effects of ‘herbal  preparations or IPs  Problems arise when people do not report about the consumption of such preparations assuming that these are devoid of any side effects by virtue of them being natural products  The need for research in this field is huge and scientific research into the quality  safety  molecular effects and clinical efficacy is crucial 
 
 
Pregnancy is considered a time of minimal intervention  and a period when herbal medicines are usually contraindicated  It is reported that many women consume indigenous medicines  that contains Bryonia laciniosa  Quercus infectoria and Putranjiva roxburghii along with other ingredients  during early pregnancy to beget a male child in India 
These preparations  often called sex selection drugs  SSD  contain herbal ingredients but these are off the label prescriptions and hence cannot be certified as ‘herbal  medicines 
The prevalence of consumption varies from   to as high as         Studies have indicated that there is  –  times higher risk of birth defects including major malformations of internal organs like urogenital and renal malformation  trachea esophageal fistula  and visible defects like spina bifida  cleft lip palate and imperforate anus 
 
  Risk of stillbirths also increases   folds 
Studies suggest that a single exposure during pregnancy can be deleterious 
 
 
 
  SSDs are reported to contain phytoestrogens  steroids and heavy metals 
 
 
 
  It is also known that although placenta serves as a barrier  most drugs and environmental chemicals enter the foetal circulation by passive diffusion or active transport  However  despite growing evidence on deleterious effects of these herbal formulations  few studies have attempted to systematically understand the risk of such preparations using animal models 
Genetic sex of a child is determined at the time of conception by the fertilization of the ovum with X or Y sperms and intake of so called preparations for sex selection can never alter that In view of these  the current study was conducted with an objective to determine the embryo foetal and development toxicity of SSDs following maternal exposure during critical period of organogenesis using a small animal model The study was guided by the OECD guidelines for testing of chemicals  Guideline no    adopted on  nd January   Prenatal Developmental Toxicity Study  and was based on a mutually approved protocol 
Personal protection equipment was employed as required while handling the test system The test facility is registered and renewed  No 
 PO RcBi S CPCSEA dated July     for breeding and to conduct research on animals for commercial purpose by the committee for the purpose of control and supervision of experiments on animals  CPCSEA  Ministry of Environment  Forests and Climate Change  Government of India 
The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee  Venus Medicine Research Center 
Due permission was taken from the Ethics Committee of Indian Institute of Public Health Delhi For this experiment  strain of Sprague Dawley of rats  Rattus norvegicus  was used 
The number of dams per group was   instead of   as laid down under OECD guidelines 
Rats of both sexes  –  g  were obtained from National Institute of Biologicals  India at  –  weeks of age  acclimatized for five days and then subjected to the experiment at  –  weeks of age 
They were housed in standard polypropylene rat cages with stainless steel top grill  one dam per cage  at a temperature of       °C  with  –  relative humidity 
Bedding material and cages were changed once in six days and   hourly light dark cycle was followed 
Animals were identified by their existing ear numbering 
Cages were labelled by tags indicating the study number  sex  group of the animals  experimental start and completion dates 
Standard pelleted feed  from Ashirwad Industries  Mohali  India  was provided ad libitum to all the animals 
They also had free access to purified water via drinking bottles throughout the study 
The feed  cages and drinking bottles were not analysed for the presence of phytoestrogens and bisphenol A 
However  similar materials were used for all the rats across all groups The drug comprised of IPs for sex selection  SSD 
These non branded locally made preparations are made available  –  days after placing an order and are never sold openly 
These preparations essentially contain herbal ingredients such as Shivlingi  Bryonia laciniosa  Majuphal  Quercus infectoria  Putrajeevak  Putranjiva roxburghii  Nagkesar  Mesua ferrea  and feather of peacock  Pavo cristatus 
A total of   such samples of SSDs were procured from varied sources like ‘pansari  shop owners  grocers  local alternative medicine practitioners  rickshaw pullers  drivers and commoners from different states 
SSDs are advised to be consumed between   and   weeks of pregnancy The samples were categorized into   groups based on redundancy of the preparations and common ingredients reported 
This was followed by chemical analysis in an accredited laboratory to detect the presence of phytoestrogens and steroids 
Since we explored the toxic effects of these preparations we wanted to select two samples that would be most predictive of toxicity 
Due to resource constraints  we did not want to subject all the   samples for animal study 
Hence  three samples of SSDs  found to be most rich in phenols and steroids were selected for toxicity study  All the three samples were also tested for heavy metals which suggested that Lead and Mercury were in very high quantities  The toxicity was examined using C  elegans  an alternate animal model 
Survival analysis and reproductive toxicity was assessed from the brood size and progeny count assay  The two SSDs that were found to be most toxic were selected as test items for the subsequent study in rat models 
SSD   was reported to contain Shivlingi and Putrajeevak while SSD   contained Shivlingi  Majuphal  Putrajeevak  Nagkesar and feathers of peacock 
Both the samples were obtained from grocers 
Local preparations like these are bound to have certain degree of variability in concentrations but more often than not  these remain the major ingredients According to studies reported  women consume such preparations along with cow s milk in dosages and schedule that are quite varied 
While some advise these IPs to be consumed for one day  others prescribe it for   days  to be taken thrice a day 
We considered the amount of SSDs most commonly reported by pregnant women  weighing   kg  which was  –  g daily for   days 
The dose of the test item   mg kg  was calculated by using conversion factor of  Conversion factor is the ratio of the correction factors  estimated by dividing the average body weight in kgs of species by the body surface area in m  of the species  Km 
Human equivalent dose  HED in mg kg    Animal dose  mg kg  X correction factor  Km animal Km human 
Kms of every species are constant 
For humans it is    assuming average weight of adults to be   kg a surface area of   m  and for rats it is  Therefore  HED   mg  kg    animal dose X  
Or  animal dose         mg kg           mg kg Since pregnant women consume these orally  these were administered to rats by oral route The test items were coded as SSD   and SSD   and were provided to the experimental laboratory  Venus Medicine Research Center  Baddi  in powder form 
On the day of dosing  the doses were administered between  –  h  The test items were administered in fresh cow s milk at a final volume of   ml kg 
The doses were calculated on the basis of the latest body weight recorded for the study 
A stainless steel gavage cannula fitted to a calibrated syringe was used for dosing the animals For control animals  cow s milk was used as a vehicle while feeding The study was performed in two phases to evaluate the effect of SSD consumption duration during gestation period Adult  nulliparous female rats were mated with males of same species and strain in  
Each morning  dams were examined for the presence of a vaginal plug and vaginal smear was taken from each dam by using pipette smear technique 
The day of vaginal plug formation or sperms observed in vaginal smear  also known as successful mating  were considered as GD   Gestation day  
The mated females were housed individually in clear polycarbonate cages with stainless steel wire lids 
Mating process was carried out to result in   pregnant animals per group 
Successfully mated females were randomized into control and treatment groups 
All the rats were sacrificed on GD  
According to OECD guidelines  the test chemical should be administered daily from implantation to the day prior to scheduled caesarean section in order to assess toxicity 
Test chemicals were administered to pregnant animals and sacrificed as per the schedule  which was as close as possible to the normal day of delivery without risking loss of data resulting from early delivery i e GD  
The females were killed  before caesarean section  the uterine contents were examined  and the fetuses were evaluated for soft tissue and skeletal changes The pregnant rats were randomized to two intervention and one control groups 
SSD was given during pre implantation to implantation stage  GD  – 
Each group of rats was treated either with vehicle  G  VC  SSD   G    mg kg  or SSD   G    mg kg SSDs were given from GD  –

Cage side observations for clinical signs of toxicity in the animals were recorded once daily until the day before necropsy •Body weight  Body weight of all experimental animals were recorded once before mating  initial body weight  and then after confirmation of mating 
Body weights were recorded on days               and on terminal day before sacrifice 
These recorded body weights were used for calculating the dose volume to be administered •Food consumption  Food consumption was evaluated once after successful mating or on day   of gestation  the day of vaginal plug formation or sperms observed in vaginal smear  and on days             and one day prior to sacrifice 
Calculated amount of feed were placed in the trough of each cage and the quantity of feed remaining after approximately   h were weighed and recorded •Morbidity Mortality  All the animals were observed twice daily  once in the morning between   and   h and once in the evening between   and   h  for incidence of morbidity and or mortality •Maternal examination related parameters  At the end of the observation period  all the dams were sequentially euthanized  by CO  asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation  and subjected to gross necropsy 
After termination  dams were examined macroscopically for any structural abnormalities or pathological changes 
Blinding was done while evaluation of the dams during caesarean section and subsequent foetal analyses to minimize bias 
Pregnancy rate was calculated as the proportion of mated pairs that had produced at least one pregnancy within a fixed period where pregnancy was determined by the earliest available evidence that fertilization has occurred 
Gestation index was calculated to indicate number of females with live born as a proportion of number of females with evidence of pregnancy •Examination of uterine contents  Immediately after termination  the uteri were removed and the pregnancy status of the animals ascertained 
Gravid uteri including the cervix were weighed  and number of corpora lutea were determined 
The uterine contents were examined for numbers of embryonic or foetal deaths and live foetuses 
The degree of resorption was described in order to estimate the relative time of death of the conceptus 
Any increase in the number of resorption and or implantation loss is an indicator of litter size for the individual dam •Examination of foetuses  The sex and weight of each foetus were determined 
Approximately one half of each litter were prepared and examined for skeletal alterations from selected dams 
The remainder were prepared and examined for soft tissue alterations  using accepted or appropriate serial sectioning methods or careful gross dissection techniques 
Each foetus was examined for external alterations 
Foetuses were examined for skeletal alterations  using Alizarin Red S staining method 
The fetuses for skeletal staining were kept in pre labelled plastic containers containing   ethanol before staining 
After skinning  we processed the foetus for staining by immersing in   alcian blue   GX for three days  then performed rehydration through a gradient series of ethanol   ethanol   –  h twice    ethanol   –  h  ethanol   –  h  distilled water until the samples sank to the bottom of a conical tube 
Samples were further treated with   KOH for  –  days or until it became clear and again treated with   alizarin red for next  –  days until bones became purple 
Samples were rinsed   times in   KOH  for  –  h at each time point 
Samples were further treated with a gradient series of glycerol  KOH    h   glycerol   h X  Visceral examination was done by micro dissection technique 
Fetuses were preserved in   formalin until they became fixed 
An illuminated magnifier was used for visceral examination 
We placed the foetus in a supine position on a paraffin wax block tray covered with paraffin wax  secured the fetal limbs by paper pins to the paraffin wax block  made a ventral midline incision from the umbilicus  cutting caudally to the genital tubercle and cranially to the diaphragm 
Once incision was completed  we located the ventral attachment of the diaphragm and lifted the liver carefully to examine the diaphragm for abnormal opening 
After observation  the diaphragm was clipped 
We gave a longitudinal cut to open the rib cage slightly lateral to and on the right of the sternebrae and then extended the cut anteriorly to neck region 
The rib cage was opened gently and secured to the paraffin block petridish tray with pins Foetuses were examined for soft tissue alterations  e g 
variations and malformations or anomalies  using Wilson s Technique 
The fetal viscera were examined sequentially  beginning with thoracic organs and moving caudally 
We performed hearts cuts after completion of other observations 
We examined the bilobed thymus for size  shape  coloration and presence of haemorrhages and then removed it for observation of trachea and esophagus 
We observed the lungs for size  color and number of lobes  observed the trachea  esophagus for normal alignment and presence of fistula  opened the pericardial sac and cut off pericardium to expose the heart for observation 
We checked the size  shape  color of the heart and normal development of major blood vessels 
After observation of thoracic viscera  we observed the abdominal viscera and liver for size  shape  color  texture  and number of lobes 
External anatomy of heart was examined by making two incisions using micro dissecting scissors We examined the stomach  spleen  pancreas  small and large intestines for size  position or any other developmental anomalies 
The intestines were moved aside after observation for seeing the underlying structures 
Ureters were checked for normal size and location and for continuity from the renal hilus to the urinary bladder 
One kidney was cut transversely and another was longitudinally to examine renal papilla and renal pelvis 
To confirm the sex of the foetus  the gonads were inspected carefully 
We examined the reproductive organs for size  shape and location GraphPad Prism® statistical software version   was used to analyze the data and all the results were represented as mean   S E M 
Intergroup variance for most of the parameters was calculated by one way analysis of variance  ANOVA  followed by Tukey s test 
A value of p     was regarded statistically significant 
Linear regression was performed to examine the weight change of dams during pregnancy for each group comparing with the control after adjusting for the litter size 
The malformations were analysed by performing Chi square test for trend for two groups  SSD  G  G  G  G  and SSD  G  G  G  G The ARRIVE guidelines were followed to report the findings 
In phase   pre natal study  all the dams dosed with SSD  and SSD  had normal food intake and weight gain 
The average gain in weight from GD  to GD   was       gms for controls while it was       gms in SSD   and       gms in SSD 
 Webtable  
No test item related mortality or clinical sign of toxicity was encountered during the study 
All dams in treatment groups and control group survived to scheduled terminal sacrifice 
They showed normal behaviour until euthanized 
There were no differences in mean maternal body weights  body weight gains  pregnancy rate  gestational index  pre and post implantation loss  and resorptions 
No significant differences were observed in foetal sex ratio  foetal body weights 
However  one dam from SSD  had all male foetuses 
No abnormality was detected in skeletal and visceral examination In phase   controls and SSD  and SSD  treated dams exhibited a comparable food intake  Table  
 
However  a dose response relationship was observed with reduced weight gain with higher doses of SSDs 
 Table  
 
Two dams  one in G   SSD    mg kg  and the other in G   SSD    mg kg  categories showed decreased or consistent body weight GD  onwards 
On an average  the weight on GD   was       gms in controls while it was       with SSD    mg kg  and       gms with SSD    mg kg 
The adjusted analysis indicated that except in G  there was a significant reduction in weight gain in all the intervention groups as compared to the control group after controlling for litter size  Table  
 During follow up  one dam from SSD    mg kg  and one from SSD    mg kg  showed haematuria during gestational day  – 
However  no another clinical sign of toxicity was encountered during the study 
All the dams in treatment and control groups showed normal behaviour and survived to scheduled terminal sacrifice 
In phase   pregnancy rate and gestational index were found to be   at all dose levels with SSD  whereas  in SSD  it decreased to   in G   SSD    mg kg  and G   SSD    mg kg  groups 
One dam from G   SSD    mg kg  and another one from G   SSD    mg kg  group showed mating confirmation during vaginal smear examination and showed positive sign in initial days of pregnancy but during necropsy on expected day of delivery  GD   no foetus was found 
Body weights of dams increased in the initial stages that became constant at a later period 
To reconfirm it  non gravid uterus was stained in salewski strain and presence of conceptus was found 
This indicated the possibility of miscarriage Increased pre and post implantation losses as well as resorptions and reduced live foetuses were observed with both SSD  and SSD 
No significant differences were observed in foetal sex ratio  but decreased foetal body weights were noted in both sexes 
On an average one early resorption in a group was a normal observation 
More than one late resorption was observed in all treatment groups while there was none in the control group 
Total count of live foetuses count was significantly reduced with SSD  and SSD  treatment in a dose dependent manner 
Total number of live foetuses were reduced up to   in SSD  at   mg kg treatment group and   in SSD  at   mg kg treatment group Both SSD  and SSD s at different dose levels showed decreased fetal weight in dose dependent manner  although the difference was not significant 
Skeletal and soft tissue alterations were observed in both treatment groups 
In general  the embryo–foetal examination showed abnormalities  which could have caused some functional damage to these foetuses if allowed to grow in the normal course 
In visceral examinations  slight dilation of the renal pelvis  reduced papilla size  urinary bladder hypertrophy was observed in few foetuses from both SSD  and SSD  treatment groups 
Few incidences of foetal soft tissue abnormalities encountered in this study were normal variants 
Skeletal examination showed variations in the ossification patterns like incomplete or poorly ossified skulls  ossification of sternebra  cleavage ossification of thoracic centrum  asymmetric thoracic centrum  and supernumerary rib in many foetuses in SSD  and SSD  groups  Table  
 
A trend was noted with increased incidence of certain malformations with increasing dosages of SSDs that was statistically significant for most malformations with SSD The results of this developmental toxicity study suggest that administration of SSDs to pregnant rats had significant impact on intrauterine foetal growth  early and late resorption as well as developmental anomalies 
These formulations have teratogenic potential but does not affect sex ratio IPs contain phytoestrogens like diadzein and genistein  In vitro rat whole embryo culture assay  WEC  studies of genistein in rats have indicated fetotoxic and teratogenic potential at concentration of ≥  μg mL  However  in vivo  an oral  gavage  embryonic and fetal development pilot study could not demonstrate any teratogenic effect in the same study 
These findings are different from our study probably because we used SSDs containing natural herbal and non herbal ingredients unlike those studies where synthetic genistein was used 
In both the studies  decreased body weight was observed indicating slight maternal toxicity 
Food consumption was unaffected in our study which is contrary to what was reported 
In another study  pregnant rats exposed to oral isoflavones  diadzein and genistein in varying combinations  showed alterations in the number of live foetuses  lysed foetuses  number of resorption sites  and implantation sites while no clinical signs suggestive of maternal toxicity  seizures  tremors and salivation  that was observed similar to our study 
Maternal mass gain was significantly reduced in rats treated with   mg kg of isoflavones  Ratio of females to males in the litter of different groups was similar akin to our finding  These observations clearly nullify the claim that consumption of SDDs could alter the sex of the growing foetus 
An analysis done by the same authors earlier revealed that SSDs contain testosterone and steroids 
 
  The prenatal testosterone in pregnancy is known to affect sexual development adversely      The principles of reproductive biology state that the genetic sex of an individual is determined at the time of conception and can never be altered under any circumstances 
However  phenotypic sex of the growing foetus is likely to be influenced by the hormonal milieu of in utero environment 
Our analysis was confined to phenotypic sex only and hence it is difficult to state if any differences existed with reference to genetic and phenotypic sex 
This requires further inquiry Evidence on the effects of SSDs on humans should best be obtained from human beings 
The findings of the current study corroborate well with the evidence generated from observational studies in human beings      Presence of skeletal and visceral malformations could explain why stillbirths are likely to be more in women who consume SSDs 
The dosing of the test drugs was intended not only to examine the period of organogenesis solely but to assess effects from preimplantation  through the entire period of gestation to the day before caesarean section 
The results were based on observations of more than   female animals with implantation sites at necropsy that added to its strength 
Unnecessary handling of pregnant animals as well as any stressors from outside was avoided 
At least three dose levels and a concurrent vehicle control were used with dams randomly allocated to different treatment groups that support the validity of the results 
However  absence of   rats per group does not support it to be a fully OECD compliant study 
We did follow the principles of Good Laboratory Practices  GLP  but due to constraints of resources the study could not be conducted as a GLP compliant study  though this is optimal for academic interests There is a lack of systematic approach to assess the safety and effectiveness of herbal preparations 
Ingredients for herbal medicines are often drawn from different sources and are used in combination  which may exhibit variability in terms of species  growing conditions  and biologically active constituents 
To isolate each active ingredient from each herb and then to establish its toxicity is time consuming  resource intensive and not practical 
Moreover  drug approval process does not accommodate undifferentiated mixtures  Though important  it surpasses the herb herb interaction and the potentiating effect of one compound over another 
Therefore  in our study  we administered the herbal mixture to assess the effects 
Real time evaluations have yielded important observations for several herbal drugs especially related to pregnancy 
For instance  Wang et al 
  used mice model to evaluate the adverse pregnancy outcomes after maternal exposure to the herbal medicines  particularly during early pregnancy  The major events included maternal and perinatal mortality 
Maternal weight gain  embryo growth and post natal weight gain were significantly decreased 
Moreover  foetal resorption and skeletal malformations were increased  signifying potential toxicity of Chinese herbal medicines 
This is comparable to our findings To conclude  the results of this developmental toxicity study suggest that administration of SSD  and SSD  to pregnant rats exerted significant impact on intrauterine foetal growth and development without any effect on sex ratio when administered during the period of organogenesis 
The prenatal exposure of SSD  and SSD  at dosage level of   mg kg day and   mg kg day during gestational days  –  to female rats had demonstrable effect on maternal or embryo foetal toxicity and teratogenicity SBN and AG conceptualized the study  AS and DD developed the study protocol and conducted the experiment  analysed the data and interpreted the findings

It is therefore natural to expect that the distribution of amino acids  across all protein sequences  would appear to be fixed  given no mutations over a specific period of time 
Of the   naturally occurring amino acids  each seems to appear randomly located at a particular position within the sequence of a protein 
However  when the sequences of a group of proteins are compared to one another  specific patterns begin to emerge 
These patterns are commonly referred to as motifs and frequently produce similar structural elements and in many cases  similar functions between the proteins that contain them 
In recent years  significant efforts have been made to reduce sequences into discrete motifs  so that each can be linked to some specific biological function based on particular rules      
Databases that consist of identifiable amino acid motifs  such as PROSITE  Pratt and EMOTIF  have been constructed to allow researchers an easy classification of unknown proteins into families based on their common motifs               
All of these methods share one property  they depend on specific alignment algorithms  such as the basic local alignment search tool  BLAST or PSI BLAST  to perform the sequence comparison between diverse families of proteins being analyzed      
These methods have already led to a number of key discoveries and offer the promise of determining biologically meaningful information about function from a protein s primary sequence It is generally accepted that a strong correlation exists between a protein s amino acid sequence and its resulting structure and function         
Techniques that can quickly determine significant similarities between protein sequences are valuable in predicting an unknown protein s function within the cell 
Here we describe a procedure that  by computing the frequency of key amino acid pairs  can quickly classify large groups of proteins into functional groups 
In order to uncover any relevant amino acid strings  we have utilized statistical methods applicable to datasets with large fluctuations in the search of human protein sequences within both the Swiss Prot and Complete Human Genebank databases The goal of this manuscript is to demonstrate how these two residue motifs can be used to develop rapid methods for searching protein or genomic databases in order to locate potentially interesting or aberrant protein sequences 
As an example  we describe the distribution of select amino acid pairs within the genome of the Coronavirus  Tor  which is responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome  SARS    
We have examined additional sets  but the limited format of this paper precludes a large presentation of potential applications The set of all   naturally occurring  amino acids are described by their standard single letter representations  and are taken as the complete set contained within all protein sequences as shown below Zq A R N D C Q E G H I L K M F P S T W Y V Residues that are arranged in a certain order can be referred to as vectors and are represented symbolically as b n b b bn bj Zq The coordinates of each vector represent the amino acid symbols contained within any given protein  where n is the total length of the vector 
The collection of all vectors b n  in the proteome can therefore be denoted simply by Zq n The underlying structure of a protein sequence  which is the order of the amino acids  has unique and identifiable characteristics 
As an analogy  in written English  the letter q is almost always followed by u 
Also  the frequency of the word  and  is much higher than that of the related three letter strings   nad   nda   dan  and  dna  which are simply permutations of the same set of individual letters to construct a word with a different meaning 
Utilizing similar characteristics  we can intuitively scan for unique sequence vectors contained within any given protein 
We expand on these characteristics  by utilizing the concepts of affinity and order stability in Section  Using the entire Swiss Prot database  release number   as the basis for our calculations  we have constructed a probability table for the occurrence of the   naturally occurring amino acids  see Table  
    
In addition to the Swiss Prot database  we have also included data from Complete Human Genebank  NCBI Build Number   March    as a source for all characterized and hypothetical human protein sequences We use the symbol Ω to denote the Swiss Prot database  and the letter M to denote the number of proteins in the database  
Hence we can state that Ω As s M  where As a a as Ns  is the sth protein  ai with i Zq is the ith amino acid in the sequence  and Ns is the length of the protein sequence As 
For any vector b n  if there is a sequence As in Ω such that b n  is a segment of As  then we can say b n  occurs in Ω 
We can then use NΩ b n  to denote the total number of outcomes that b n  has occurred in Ω  and let NΩ n  be the total number of all vectors occurring in Ω with length n  Therefore p b n NΩ b n NΩ n is the probability that the vector b n  occurs in Ω 
We then introduce k p q b n log p b n q b n where p b n  and q b n  are any two probability distributions on Zq n  and b n  belongs to Zq n 
The quantity k p q b n  in Eq 
  is defined for any two probability distributions p b n  and q b n  on Zq n  where the distribution q arises from independent letter  i e  amino acid  probabilities 
Then  k p q b n  can be viewed as a random variable about b n  and its probability distribution is defined as follows F p q x PI k p q b n ⩽x b n k p q b n ⩽xp b n The expectation value μ p q  and variance σ p q  of p b n  are expressed mathematically as μ p q b n Zq n p b n k p q b n 
 σ p q b n Zq n p b n k p q b n μ p q  Hence we see that μ p q  is simply the Kullback–Leibler entropy   
As a consequence  μ p q  is always non negative and μ p q  if and only if p b n q b n 
As a result  the amino acid sequence of b n  can be represented by k p q b n In Eq 
  the probability distributions p  q in the k p q b n  have several possible values 
For example  if we let p be the probability of b n  and only change the value of q in k p q b n  we obtain the following expression q b n j np bj p b p b p bn Based on Eqs 
  and   the value of k p q b n  gives us the affinity for all amino acids within vector b n 
Here two situations are identified as especially interesting i When k p q b n  implies that among the amino acids in vector b n  there is an increased affinity 
That is  the vector b n  occurs more frequently than expected 
 ii When k p q b n  implies that among the amino acids in vector b n  there is a decreased affinity 
That is  the vector b n  occurs less frequently than expected In a similar approach to the condition described above  we may choose q b n p πn b n  where πn b n  is a permutation of b n  and πn denotes a permutation transform 
In this case  the order sensitivity of b n  can also be reflected by the value of k p q b n  and produces the following outcomes i when k p q b n  implies that b n  occurs much more often than πn b n ii when k p q b n  implies that πn b n  occurs much more often than b n In addition to the concepts of affinity and order sensitivity  we can also design other analysis techniques by choosing alternate representations of q b n 
Quantifying the terms k p q b n  we can represent vector frequency numerically 
In cases where k p q b n μ p q ⩾ σ p q  the corresponding vector b n  is called  positive  while in those cases where the opposite takes place  k p q b n μ p q ⩽ σ p q  the vector b n  is called  negative 
By judiciously choosing a   equal to   we obtained   two residue  positive pairs  and   two residue negative pairs  see Table  
  out of a total of   possibilities of amino acid pairs Using any one of the positive motifs from Table   we can develop a test method to detect changes in their distribution through any protein database 
If b b b  is  positive  then p b b μ σp b p b  where p ⋅  is the probability of the amino acids or vectors ⋅ in the database 
Since NΩ μ M Nμ p bj NΩ bj μ MNμ we have NΩ b μ M Nμ μ MNμ μ σp b NΩ b or NΩ b μ M Nμ μ MNμ μ σp b NΩ b and since μ M Nμ is very close to μ MNμfor Swiss Prot database we have NΩ b μ σp b NΩ b and NΩ b μ σp b NΩ b As a consequence of Eq 
  the detection of a deleterious mutation based on the increased appearance of an arbitrary string of these residues becomes possible 
For example  according to Table   CC is an attractive motif with   then NΩ CC μ σp C μ M Nμ μ MNμNΩ C ≈ μ σp C NΩ C Let Ns CC  and Ns C  be the number of CC and the number of C in the sth protein 
Then we have NΩ CC NΩ C  because μ σ  and p C  since NΩ CC s MNs CC NΩ C s MNs C Based upon the result that the CC pair represents a rare event  proteins satisfying Ns CC Ns C  as defined in Eq 
  suddenly become interesting 
We can therefore consider the number Ns CC  as an index to develop detection methods to test for the presence of a CC containing protein within a database 
Using this same reasoning  one can also use any other one of the remaining motifs in Table   to develop detection methods for additional proteins In an identical fashion to the previous example using the positive two residue motifs in Table   we can also use any of the  negative  two residue motifs to develop search methods 
For example  the CM pair is a  negative  two residue  word  with  
That is  p CM μ σp C p M 
Using identical arguments to those described in Section   we obtain NΩ CM NΩ M  and NΩ CM NΩ C 
Since both Ns M  and Ns C  are small numbers for fixed proteins  the overall number of CM pairs in most proteins should be close to zero 
Therefore  we can also use any of the remaining seven  negative  motifs in Table   to develop additional detection methods In contrast to the CC motif  the total number of proteins in the Swiss Prot database having more than one CM pair is quite small 
For example  among the   proteins contained within this database  the number of proteins such that Ns CM ⩾  is   and the number of proteins satisfying the condition Ns CM ⩾  is only  
For human proteins in Swiss Prot  the total number of proteins containing CM pairs is   and there are only   proteins that satisfy Ns CM ⩾   Table  
However  we would expect to find about   proteins having CM pairs in the Swiss Prot database  based upon the amino acid frequencies given in Table   which is greater than the number observed Cysteine rich proteins and the presence of CC pairs in proteins are both concepts that have been studied previously      
If we combine these two concepts and describe them in mathematical terms  we observe that the rates q Ns C Ns and q Ns CC Ns C  describe these two conditions  where Ns  Ns C  and Ns CC  are the numbers of all amino acids  cysteine  and CC  respectively 
We can then derive proteinsNs C Ns p C σ Ns CC Ns C p ξτ C ξτ C σ where σ  and σ  are the standard deviations about Ns C Nss Mand Ns CC Ns C s M respectively We have found the following computational results based on Swiss Prot database σ ≈ σ ≈ andp ξτ C ξτ C ⩾ p C For   we have a much simpler method to determine that a protein sequence is both C  and CC rich if proteinsNs C Ns ∩proteinsNs CC Ns C So  a much simpler method to test whether a protein is a both C  and CC rich for   isNumber of CC  Number of C Number of C  Length of protein Using this principle  we found a total of eight proteins that are both C  and CC rich within the Swiss Prot database For   there is an easier method to determine whether a protein sequence is both C  and CC rich if proteinsNs C Ns ∩proteinsNs CC Ns C So  a much simpler method to test whether a protein is both C  and CC rich for   is based on the inequalitiesNumber of CC  Number of C Number of C  Length of protein Using this principle  we can get a total of   proteins that are both C  and CC rich within the entire Swiss Prot database For   there is also an easier method to determine if a protein sequence is both C  and CC rich sequence when proteinsNs C Ns ∩proteinsNs CC Ns C So  a much simpler method to test whether a protein is both C  and CC rich for   is based on the inequalitiesNumber of CC  Number of C Number of C Length of protein Using this principle  we have identified a total of   proteins that are both C  and CC rich within the Swiss Prot database 
From these results  it becomes clear that there are many C rich proteins and many CC rich proteins that are not mutually inclusive 
The sets of both C  and CC rich proteins are only subsets of the set containing all C rich proteins or that containing all CC rich proteins Because the Swiss Prot database is somewhat biased to those proteins that are of interest to researchers  we have decided to examine a database that was  in essence  complete 
For this  we chose the human subset sequences contained within the Complete Human Genebank database 
This was the most complete and readily available source of human genetic sequences and should therefore provide us with an accurate representation of both CC and CM pair distributions 
We observed that the total number of CC pairs within the human subset of sequences contained in Genebank  a total of   proteins  was  
These pairs were contained within a total of   proteins  Table   a number that is substantially larger than the   we obtained from Swiss Prot data  Table  
Since the total number of amino acids in The Complete Human Genebank is   we can easily get the expected number of CC in Complete Human Genebank is   which is much less than this actual value  
The same also holds true for the CM pair  where we would expect to see   CM pairs  but actually observe    Table  
 
This result is surprising but true and shows that there are fundamental difference between the Human and other species in terms of the frequency of CC and CM pairs To create a single CM pair  it is obvious that one needs only a single C  If a protein sequence also contains a CC pair  the total number of cysteines available to create a CM pair has been reduced by a factor of  
Using the cutoff value of four CC pairs as statistically significant  we determined the probability of finding a CM pair within proteins that already contained a CC pair  Table  
Even though both CC and CM can occur in the same protein  the total number of proteins in Genebank that contain both CC and CM pairs is   and these pairs almost always occur at different locations in the sequence 
However  in some rare cases the second C within the CC pair is shared with the first C within the CM pair  giving us a new triplet CCM If we filter the set of proteins described above for redundant entries  we obtain a set of   unique proteins that contain the CCM triplet in the human proteome 
Using the probability distributions obtained from Swiss Prot  we obtained the probability of CCM as  
Since the total of all protein lengths in the Swiss Prot database is   there should be a total of   CCM triplets 
This value is almost identical to the predicted number of CCM of  
This result suggests that the CCM triplet at least in Swiss Prot occurs randomly 
However  we can also analyze the CCM probability using a different approach  putting q CCM p CC p M  into Eq 
 
If CCM occurs randomly  then we have p CCM p C p C p M  and since p CC μ σp C p C  we will get k p q CCM log p CCM q CCM log p C p CC ⩽ μ σ Based on Eq 
  it is clear that the presence of a CC pair strongly excludes M  Therefore  the probability of the CCM triplet should occur less frequently than that of CC or M individually We have obtained the following statistical results with regard to the total number of CC and CM pairs contained in the Swiss Prot database i The total number of these proteins satisfying Ns CC ⩾  is   and   of these are found in humans 
 ii The total number of human proteins in Ω that satisfy Ns CC ⩾  is  
 iii The total number of the proteins in Ω that satisfy Ns CM ⩾  is     of these are found in humans 
 iv The total number of human proteins in Ω that satisfy Ns CM ⩾  is only  
The genome of the SARS associated Coronavirus contains a total of   open reading frames  which code for six characterized and five uncharacterized proteins   
After examining the complete proteome the SARS associated Coronavirus we observed a statistically significant increase in the occurrence of the CC and CM pairs in the SARS associated Coronavirus  genome Of the   putative proteins  four contain either CC or CM pairs 
Two large poly proteins  GI  and GI  contain   CC and   CM pairs  as well as   CC and   CM pairs  respectively 
The putative spike glycoprotein  GI    contains   CC and   CM  while the small envelope protein  GI    contains only   CC pair 
The remaining   proteins  of which two have been identified as a nucleocapsid and matrix protein  contain no CC or CM pairs 
When compared to the occurrence of CC and CM pairs within all human proteins found in the Swiss Prot database  it becomes clear that there is an increased occurrence of these pairs within the SARS associated Coronavirus proteome It is clear that the frequency of CC and CM pairs is significantly higher in the SARS genome than it is in the human genome 
It is our hope that these unique two residue motifs could be used as a means of identifying a virus such as SARS 
While currently impossible to determine  one can see a possible clinical use for determining the frequency of CC or CM pairs in an individual 
If a person has been infected by SARS  we would expect the numbers of CC and CM pairs to be much higher than in a healthy individual 
If we were then able to develop a clinically feasible technique that could identify the CC or CM pair content in total cellular protein  without damaging the cell  it could be possible to implement a detection method simply by counting the numbers of CC or CM pairs in all proteins examined 
If the presence of increased CC or CM pairs was indicative of infection by SARS we could develop new drugs to inhibit the translation of proteins that contain these pairs within infected cells 
As a very specific example  this could be accomplished through the use of specific tRNA mimics that could block translating ribosome when these pairs appear at the P and A site simultaneously      
While tRNA mimics could normally be seen as non specific protein synthesis inhibitors  the lower frequency of the CC or CM motifs in host proteins as compared to the relatively high occurrence in viral protein provide a starting point for the analysis of treatments using methods such as these In this paper we have performed a detailed search of the Swiss Prot and Complete Human Genebank database in relation to the frequencies of each of the   natural amino acids and motifs made up of two residues 
This has provided us with a new insight into the distribution of proteins within these databases and the information that may be contained within a protein s primary amino acid sequence 
Our focus in this quest has been to examine specific pairs or triplets of residues and use probability theory to assess whether or not particular strings of residues occur more frequently than their probability would indicate 
By analyzing affinity and anti affinity  we developed a procedure to search out all two  and three residue clusters within these databases 
Through this technique  we can rapidly classify large groups of proteins into families based on the occurrence of these motifs 
Combining this concept with a specific knowledge of protein function  we propose novel ideas aimed at developing fast detection methods for specific diseases based on the unusually high occurrence of some of these motifs when compared with the expected probabilities 
A timely example of the application of this method is given  namely the analysis of the SARS virus 
This method will hopefully lead to the discovery of new diagnostic techniques and possible treatment of diseases  by recognizing the location of target domains in the expressed sequence Cell type specific expression of the putative SARS CoV  receptor ACE  in human heartsThe coronavirus disease    COVID  caused by SARS CoV  infections imposes a major threat for the world s healthcare systems and is leading to thousands of deaths 
Angiotensin converting enzyme    ACE  has been identified as a potential receptor for SARS coronavirus  and is also considered the main receptor for SARS CoV  SARS CoV  binds to ACE  via its glycosylated outer membrane spike proteins 
ACE  is highly expressed in the lung and heart  and is known for its vital role in the cardiovascular system –  Although SARS CoV  mainly invades alveolar epithelial cells  it can also cause myocardial injury  as assessed by increased troponin T and NT proBNP levels accompanying increased cardiovascular symptoms in COVID infected patients  It is unclear whether elevated biomarkers of cardiac injury  or long term effects on the cardiovascular system  are directly caused by viral infection of cardiac tissue or are secondary to hypoxia and systemic inflammation 
However  patients with underlying cardiovascular disease represent a significant proportion of the patients who may suffer from a severe course after COVID  infection  This situation may be aggravated by findings showing that ACE inhibitors  which are often used to treat cardiovascular diseases  augment the expression of the SARS CoV  receptor ACE  in lung cells  This is probably mediated by an effect on angiotensin II  which is known to reduce ACE  expression  Thus  ACE inhibition decreases angiotensin II  leading to an indirect up regulation of ACE  The effect of angiotensin II receptor blockers  ARBs  which primarily target the angiotensin receptor   is unclear 
One may speculate that ARBs indirectly reduce ACE  levels by augmenting free angiotensin II levels  which in turn is expected to down regulate ACE  via activating the angiotensin receptor  
However  the effect of the two different treatments on the expression of ACE  in the heart requires further investigation Therefore  we used single nuclei RNA sequencing to determine the expression of ACE and ACE  in the different cell types of the human heart 
Gene expression signatures were detected in cardiac tissues of five patients with aortic stenosis  AS  and two patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction  HFrEF   Figure  A  and compared with with samples of one healthy donor heart  age    years  male  that was not used for transplantation 
After single nuclei RNA sequencing  data were pooled  and unsupervised clustering was performed with a total of     nuclei 
We found   distinct clusters 
Using cell type specific gene markers  major cell types were annotated  including cardiomyocytes  six clusters  fibroblasts  one cluster  endothelial cells  three clusters  leucocytes  two clusters  pericytes  one cluster  and smooth muscle cells  one cluster   Figure  B–D 
ACE  was expressed in cardiomyocytes  Cluster   and   and mural cells  particularly pericytes  Cluster   and was detected at a lower expression level in fibroblasts  endothelial cell  and leucocytes  Figure  D 
Comparison of ACE  in a pooled analysis of nuclei of the different groups showed that ACE  was significantly elevated in cardiomyocytes of patients with heart disease compared with healthy controls  Figure  E 
ACE  was also slightly  but not significantly  increased in endothelial cells  and the expression was lower in fibroblasts of patients with heart disease compared with healthy controls  Figure  E 
Immunostaining confirmed an increased expression of ACE  in cardiomyocytes of patients with aortic stenosis  Figure  F 
In addition  ACE was augmented in cardiomyocytes of patients with AS and HFrEF  Figure  G 
Interestingly  cardiomyocytes of patients who were treated with ACE inhibitors showed a significantly higher ACE  expression compared with ARB treated patients  Figure  H 
Moreover  patients treated with ACE inhibitors had an imbalance of ACE to ACE  expression  with a more than four fold higher ACE ACE  ratio compared with healthy control cells  Figure  I In conclusion  these data provide novel insights into the cell type specific expression and regulation of ACE  in the heart 
Patients with varying heart disease aetiology show augmented expression of ACE  levels particularly in cardiomyocytes 
Treatment with ACE inhibitors tends to be associated with increased ACE  mRNA and unfavourable ACE ACE  ratios  which are believed to be a driver of cardiovascular pathologies  This study is limited by its small sample size and therefore is only hypothesis generating 
However  these novel data suggest that it will be important to monitor SARS CoV infected patients for cardiovascular complications and assess the impact of ARB ACE inhibitor therapy 
Conflict of interest  none declared New onset acute symptomatic seizure and risk factors in coronavirus disease   A retrospective multicenter studyIn December   pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus  later called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus    SARS‐CoV‐  was first reported in Wuhan  China 
On March     the World Health Organization  WHO  declared the syndrome caused by SARS‐CoV‐  infection  coronavirus disease    COVID‐  a pandemic 
According to a WHO Situation Report of April    
 
 there are   confirmed COVID‐  cases and   deaths globally 
COVID‐  affects people of all ages 
 
  
 
 and in severe cases  it may cause dyspnea  hypoxia  acute respiratory distress syndrome  and septic shock 
 
  
 

The current situation has raised concerns regarding whether people with epilepsy have a higher risk to be infected with COVID‐  and whether people would develop acute seizures during the course of COVID‐ 
The objective of this study is to clarify the incidence and the risk of acute symptomatic seizures during acute COVID‐  infections This retrospective multicenter study was approved by the ethics committee of West China Hospital  Sichuan University  approval   
The study was conducted in   officially designed hospitals in Hubei province  the epicenter of the COVID‐  epidemic in China  Sichuan province  and Chongqing municipality 
These hospitals included the East Branch of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University  West China Ward  Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital  and hospitals in Sichuan province designated by the government to treat COVID‐   see the list of hospitals in Appendix S People with COVID‐  who were discharged from or died in the participating hospitals between January   and February     were consecutively enrolled 
All cases were diagnosed according to the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for COVID‐   trial version  
 
 All those enrolled tested positive through nucleic acid detection 
Disease severity was classified as mild  moderate  severe  or critical according to the national guidelines  see Box   for classification criteria 
 
 For our study  we aggregated severe and critical cases into a single severe group  whereas mild and moderate cases were aggregated into a single milder group 
The clinical outcome at discharge was either cured or death Electronic medical records of all enrolled cases were reviewed by   neurologists using a standard case report form  Appendix S 
Data were extracted on demographic characteristics  medical history  complications  treatments  and presence of risk factors for seizures 
These risk factors were considered to be the following  acute cerebrovascular disease  traumatic brain injury  TBI  central nervous system  CNS  infection  shock  hypoxia  severe metabolic disturbance  based on criteria from the International League Against Epilepsy
 
  multiple‐organ dysfunction syndrome  sepsis  and exposure to drugs or toxic substances Continuous variables were presented as median  interquartile range  and categorical variables as n  All of   people discharged from or who died at participating hospitals were consecutively identified and enrolled 
Most were from Sichuan province  n     followed by Chongqing  n     and Hubei  n    Ten individuals died  giving case fatality rates of    n     in Hubei     n     in Chongqing  and    n     in Sichuan 
Of the   severe cases      received mechanical ventilation  and     were given sedatives 
Apart from the effect of sedatives  mental state was relatively normal in   people 
Eight were encephalopathic  one was obtunded  one was delirious  and six were comatose 
The diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus was not made in any of these cases based on clinical presentation  results of investigations  or response to therapy 
No routine or long‐term electroencephalogram  EEG  was recorded due to exposure concerns None in this cohort had a past history of epilepsy 
None had any seizures  including febrile seizures  or status epilepticus during hospitalization 
Seizurelike events were seen in two people  it was believed that this was the result of an acute stress reaction in one and hypocalcemia in the other The first was a  ‐year‐old woman who reported bilateral bodily spasms lasting for about   minute  with mouth deviation but no impairment of awareness 
She was evaluated neurologically and psychiatrically and was diagnosed with an acute anxiety disorder  which was treated with olanzapine  paroxetine  and diazepam The second case was a  ‐year‐old woman who displayed bilateral myoclonus in the limbs with no impairment in consciousness   hours after admission 
Although this was initially suspected to represent seizures  she was found to have an electrolyte disturbance including hyponatremia  hypokalemia  and hypocalcemia  and the myoclonus resolved with correction of the metabolic disturbances Eighty‐four   cases reported systemic or direct brain insults that increased their risk for acute symptomatic seizures  Table  
The most common risk factor was hypoxia 
No severe electrolyte disturbance was seen  but hypokalemia  n       hyponatremia  n       and hypocalcemia  n       were frequently seen in the cohort 
Urea  creatinine  and serum glucose levels were moderately altered in most of cases 
In two cases who had chronic kidney dysfunction  substantial increases in creatinine levels were noted 
Results of investigations are shown in Table  
One case with TBI had an epidural hematoma  cerebral contusion  and skull base fracture 
Five people with severe COVID‐  experienced septic shock 
Three other cases of shock had hypovolemia or cardiac problems 
Ninety‐four   were given antibiotics  moxifloxacin  n       piperacillin sulbactam sodium  n       and third‐generation cephalosporins  n       were most commonly used We found no new onset seizures or status epilepticus in a large cohort of people hospitalized during the acute phase of COVID   infection despite a substantial proportion having risk factors for acute symptomatic seizures 
This is useful information  given the prior lack of knowledge about seizure risk during the acute phase of infection No individual in this cohort had a history of epilepsy prior to hospital admission 
To date  there is not much information available on people with epilepsy during the COVID‐  crisis 
There is one report of epilepsy in a case COVID‐  from Wuhan 
 
 As information is limited  it is not possible to establish whether this was a patient who had a history of epilepsy or whether the patient presented acute seizures 
There is at this time little if any evidence indicating that people with epilepsy are at an increased risk of COVID‐  infection 
A major challenge for people with epilepsy in this outbreak is nonadherence with the prescribed antiseizure medication  which was seen during the in SARS endemic in  
 
 This indicates the need to ensure the availability of supplies of medications and to advocate patients  self‐management 
Possible strategies for coping could also include online consultations and telemedicine networks Although many neurological and systemic disorders regarded as potential triggers
 
 of acute symptomatic seizures were identified in this cohort  seizures and status were not seen 
Stroke is one such risk factor 
The risk of developing acute symptomatic seizures after stroke ranges from   to  
 
 Acute cerebrovascular disease is considered a major cause of seizure and status epilepticus 
An earlier study from Hubei
 
  
 
 also reported six people with COVID‐  who had acute cerebrovascular disease without seizure 
Infection of the CNS can also give rise to seizures 
Although there is limited evidence of the presence of the SARS‐CoV‐  in the cerebrospinal fluid  CSF  the co‐occurrence of tubercular meningitis
 
 had been reported  with no seizure or status observed 
To determine whether COVID‐  can cause direct CNS insults requires further follow‐up 
In the earlier outbreaks of another coronavirus  a generalized convulsion with a positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for SARS‐CoV in CSF was reported  which could have been a coincidence 
 

Disturbances of homeostasis may lead to acute symptomatic seizures 
Hypoxia  the most common complication in our cohort  may trigger anoxic encephalopathy  particularly in refractory hypoxia 
Electrolyte disturbances as seen in COVID‐  are considered to be potential causes of acute symptomatic seizure 
 
 The severity and speed of such disturbances may affect onset of seizures  so these parameters should be carefully monitored The cytokine storm syndromes
 
 behind severe infection may cause the production of inflammatory cytokines systemically  with the consequence of acute toxic encephalopathies 
Although sepsis is a common cause of encephalopathy in intensive care medicine 
 
 hypoxia appears far more often than sepsis in COVID‐ 
There was also a high rate of septic shock in the COVID‐  population  varying from  
 
 to   in earlier studies in Hubei 
 
  
 

Certain antibiotics have been associated with symptomatic seizure 
 
 Antibiotics were used in a large number of people in our cohort without problems  but the most used antibiotics in the cohort were of low or moderate risk 
Clinicians should keep this seizure risk in mind when prescribing antibiotics  especially for people with renal dysfunction 
 

Our study has several limitations 
First  as a cross‐sectional study  we only have data from the acute phase of the disease 
A follow‐up study is underway to evaluate longitudinal seizure outcomes 
Second  the retrospective study design meant that we could not collect data on all relevant variables  for example  EEG was not recorded  so subclinical seizures could have been missed 
As all health care costs of COVID‐  treatment are covered by the government  all those suspected of infection are screened 
This may assure the objectivity and reliability of study materials  and it will allow for a future follow‐up study Our analysis suggests that COVID‐  poses minimal risk for seizures during the acute illness  although a significant proportion of severely ill individuals have risk factors that may increase the propensity to experience seizures 
These risk factors should be promptly addressed to minimize the risk of developing seizures 
Prospective long‐term studies must be done to determine whether people who have suffered from COVID‐  have an increased risk for developing seizures or epilepsy in subsequent months or years as a consequence of their illness None of the authors has any conflict of interest to disclose 
We confirm that we have read the Journal s position on issues involved in ethical publication and affirm that this report is consistent with those guidelines Decreased prealbumin level is associated with increased risk of mortality in hospitalized elderly patients with COVID The coronavirus disease    COVID  epidemic is caused by an infection with a novel coronavirus  officially named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus    SARS COV 
The infection spread rapidly on all continents and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization 
As of April       documented cases were reported worldwide  and   patients had died 
As there are currently no specific treatments and medications against the new virus  it is crucial to identify risk factors of severe prognosis Older patients have poorer prognostic factors and are more likely to experience critical disease 
 
 
Based on recent statistical data of China  among patients who were   years and older  the mortality rate was   which was significantly higher than that of younger patients at  
The proportion of deaths over   years old accounts for   of the total deaths in the national wide  which implicates aged people are more vulnerable to the SARS CoV 
Till present there are rare reports in literature focusing on the risk factors for poor outcomes of the elderly patients with COVID Serum prealbumin  known as transthyretin  its levels may be lowered not only by malnutrition  but also by inflammation and aging 
 
 
Compared to albumin  prealbumin has a shorter half life  a more rapid rate of hepatic synthesis  and predictable catabolic rate  hence  it may be a more sensitive indicator 
However  whether prealbumin could be an independent predictor of mortality in hospitalized COVID  elderly patients needs to be further elucidated The present study aims to describe the clinical characteristics and to investigate whether the prealbumin can serve as a valuable predictor of in hospital mortality  which might provide evidence for the risk stratification in elderly and help to improve the clinical practice and reduce fatality We designed this study as a retrospective cohort study design 
The elderly patients with COVID  who were admitted to Tongji Hospital in Wuhan from January   to February     were consecutively included 
This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Tongji Hospital  Approval Number  TJ IRB  and was complied with the Declaration of Helsinki 
The data were anonymous and the study was observational  so the informed consent was not gathered 
A flow diagram illustrating patient selection was described in Figure  
 
Inclusion criteria included elderly patients  ≥   years old  diagnosed with COVID  infection 
A total of   participants have been obtained 
Patients having missing baseline or outcome data  died on admission or being transferred to other designated hospitals during hospitalization were excluded 
There were   patients were included in the final analyses Data collection of participants was performed using hospital electronic medical record system 
Information included medical history  demographic data  physical examination  and hematological  biochemical  radiological and microbiological evaluation results were reviewed 
The data collection forms were reviewed independently by   researchers  CL and LYY 
Blood examinations were assessed at the central laboratory of Tongji Hospital following standard operative procedures 
The routine blood test was analyzed using Sysmex XE  hematology analyzer  Sysmex  Kobe  Japan 
The Cobas C   Roche  Mannheim  Germany  was used to measure the biochemical parameters 
Coagulation tests were detected by STA R MAX coagulation analyzer  Diagnostica Stago  Saint Denis  France 
Throat swab samples were collected and were tested for SARS CoV  with commercial real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  RT PCR  kit from DAAN GENE  Guangzhou  China 
The diagnostic criteria and all clinical procedures in this study followed  Diagnosis and Treatment of Pneumonia Caused by New Coronavirus  Trial version   to   promulgated by the National Health and Health Commission of China Summary statistics of baseline characteristics of all patients and stratification by prealbumin tertiles were expressed as frequency and proportion for categorical variables  mean   standard deviation  SD   Gaussian distribution  or median  range   Skewed distribution  for continuous variables  and as percentages for categorical variables 
The differences between groups were analyzed using the χ   categorical variables  One Way ANOVA test  normal distribution  or Kruskal Whallis H test  skewed distribution We examined the relationship of the prealbumin as categorized into tertiles with the outcomes of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation 
Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to evaluate these relationships  then unadjusted and adjusted odds ratio  ORs  and   confidence intervals  CIs  were calculated 
Model   is the minimally adjusted model with only sociodemographic variables adjusted 
Model   is the fully adjusted model with covariates including age  sex  smoking status  history of hypertension  history of coronary heart disease  history of diabetes  history of chronic kidney disease  history of carcinoma  history of chronic liver disease  neutrophil  lymphocyte  prothrombin time  activated partial thromboplastin time  d dimer  alanine transaminase  aspartate aminotransferase  total bilirubin  blood urea nitrogen  creatinine  C reactive protein and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio 
We calculated odds ratio  ORs  and   confidence intervals  CIs 
The highest tertile was the reference for prealbumin 
We performed test for linear trend by entering the median value of each category of prealbumin tertile as continuous variable to examine the possibility of nonlinearity To ensure the robustness of our results  we also performed stratified analyses with the prealbumin as a continuous variable for the overall population and stratified by gender  age  hypertension status and coronary heart disease status at baseline 
Generalized additive models were used to visually confirm the relationship between prealbumin as continuous variable and the risk of outcomes  all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation Modeling was performed with the statistical software packages R  http www R project org  The R Foundation  and EmpowerStats  http www empowerstats com  X Y Solutions  Inc  Boston  MA 
P values less than    two sided  were considered statistically significant In our study    cases were excluded 
To avoid selection bias due to missing data  we performed a sensitivity analysis 
The results showed that there was no statistical difference between missing group and non missing group  supplemental table  Of   elderly inpatients included in the final analysis  the mean age was     years  ranging from   years to   years  and most patients were male  table  
 
The baseline characteristics of these included participants were listed in table 
The day of sample drawing after admission was       day 
No significant statistical difference in sex  smoking status  body weight  BMI  comorbidity  hypertension  coronary heart disease  chronic kidney disease  cerebral vascular disease  carcinoma  chronic liver disease  symptoms  fever  cough  headache  diarrhea and myalgia fatigue at admission  were detected across different groups of prealbumin  tertile 
When compared with subjects in the highest tertile  those in the lowest tertile were older  more likely to have diabetes medical history  with higher Neutrophil count  lower lymphocyte count  worse coagulation function and liver function 
A total of     patients required mechanical ventilation      patients admitted to intensive care unit and     patients died during hospitalization 
The incidence of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation were significantly decreased across prealbumin tertiles  all cause death    vs    vs    for tertile   vs  tertile   vs  tertile   ICU admission    vs    vs    for tertile   vs  tertile   vs  tertile   mechanical ventilation    vs    vs    for tertile   vs  tertile   vs  tertile   respectively To investigate the correlation between prealbumin and in hospital outcomes  we constructed three models using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models  table  
 
In the unadjusted model  the ORs of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation was significantly increased as the prealbumin tertiles downgraded 
The OR for tertile   was significantly higher than the OR for tertile    OR       CI    to   P   for all cause death  OR       CI    to   P   for ICU admission  OR       CI    to   P   for mechanical ventilation 
Additional adjustment for the demographic variables and comorbidities did not reduce the ORs for the association between prealbumin tertiles and in hospital outcomes 
Further adjusting for the baseline levels of blood examinations  including blood routine  neutrophil  lymphocyte  neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio  coagulation function  prothrombin time  activated partial thromboplastin time  d dimer  liver fuction  alanine transaminase  aspartate aminotransferase  total bilirubin  renal function  blood urea nitrogen  creatinine  and infection indicators  C reactive protein  did not affect the relationships in the fully adjusted models  OR       CI    to   P   for all cause death  OR       CI    to   P   for ICU admission  OR       CI    to   P     for mechanical ventilation 
Therefore  lower tertile of prealbumin exhibited an increased risk of worse in hospital outcomes  full adjusted P for trend for all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation  P     P   and P     respectively Generalized additive models  Fig  
A through  C  were used to visually assess functional relationships between the prealbumin as continuous variate and the risk of in hospital outcomes 
Serum prealbumin was found to have negative linear relationship with the risk of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation To determine the consistency of the relationship between baseline prealbumin as a continuous variable and in hospital outcomes  we conducted stratified analyses  Table  
 
For each unit increase of prealbumin  the adjusted OR for all cause death was   in males  P     and   in females  P    
The adjusted OR for all cause death for persons less than   years of age was    P     compared with    p     for persons   years and older  P interaction    
For each unit increase of the prealbumin  the OR for all cause death was    P     and    P     for normotensives and hypertensives     P     and    P     for non diabetic and diabetes respectively 
The difference of interaction was not significant between two groups  P interaction         and   stratified for gender  age  hypertention and diabetes respectively 
Moreover  the relationship between baseline prealbumin with ICU admission and mechanical ventilation stratified by gender  age  hypertention and diabetes are consistent In this study  we found that lower serum prealbumin significantly associated with an increased risk of worse outcomes and all cause death during hospitalization 
Patients in the lowest tertile of prealbumin were older  and with higher Neutrophil count  lower lymphocyte count  worse coagulation function and liver function compared with subjects in the highest tertile 
Then we adjusted relevant covariates including age  sex  smoking status  comorbidities  neutrophil  lymphocyte  coagulation function  liver function  renal function and C reactive protein to minimize the potential impact of confounding 
Compared with crude regression analyses  this association still persisted when adjusting for demographic and clinical variables in the multivariable regression analyses 
Moreover  stratified by gender  age  hypertension and diabetes  increased level of serum prealbumin was associated with the decreased risk of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation  which determine the consistency of the relationship between lowest serum prealbumin tertile and the increased risk of worse outcomes in elderly COVID  patients Several previous studies have demonstrated baseline prealbumin change in COVID  patients 
Decreased level of prealbumin was observed among COVID  patients 
Wu C et al investigated   patients with COVID  and observed that prealbumin was associated with the development of ARDS  indicating the potential value of prealbumin level on COVID  clinical ending 
Till date  no report exists on the effect of prealbumin in COVID  elderly patients High proportion of severe to critical cases and high fatality rate were observed in the elderlyCOVID  patients  and rapid disease progress was noted in the dead 
One possible explanation involves the greater potential of seniors to be in a state of inflammation  nutritional deficiency and other complications 
Prealbumin is a globular  non glycosilated protein  synthesized by the liver  and complexed with a retinol binding protein  which acts as a transporter of retinol vitamin A and thyroid hormones 
Low plasma prealbumin level has far back emerged as an earliest laboratory indicator of poor nutritional status 
 
 
In addition  prealbumin are also associated with inflammation 
Previous studies showed that in response to the inflammation  the body responds by synthesizing a large number of cytokines 
These include interleukins and tumor necrosis factors that down regulate  decrease  plasma concentrations of albumin and prealbumin 
 
 
Therefore  assay of serum prealbumin concentration is recommended by some investigators as a screening marker for both malnutrition and inflammation Elderly with low plasma prealbumin levels mean that those people are at greater risk of malnutrition and inflammatory conditions  which may lead to poor prognosis 
Malnutrition is commonly seen in hospitalized patients in both the developed and developing world  especially among elderly patients 
A review of   published studies of acute care patients reported that malnutrition incidence ranged from  –  of hospitalized elderly 
It was found that compared to non famine regions of India  experiencing famine had significantly higher influenza mortality rates during the   Influenza pandemic 
Aging  frailty  and chronic diseases are associated with impaired immune function and are compounded by immune dysregulation from malnutrition 
When immune response is dysregulated  it would result in an excessive inflammation  even death 
In the current COVID  study  it was found that elderly patients have higher levels of white blood cells counts  CRP  inflammatory cytokines and are more likely to experience critical disease than did those younger patients 
 
 This retrospective cohort study included   elderly COVID  patients  until the date of February       of patients required mechanical ventilation    of patients admitted to intensive care unit  and the total in hospital mortality was  
The mortality rate was lower than that reported by wang L et al  among elderly COVID  patients 
This may have been the reason for some patients at the date of February     are still in hospital 
Nevertheless  this would not bias the relationship between prealbumin and in hospital outcomes because of the definite observation time we set previously 
Moreover  Wuhan tongji Hospital as one of the largest third grade Class A hospitals equipped with advanced life support training and equipment may partly account for the moderate mortality The results of this study have several clinical implications and strengths 
A low prealbumin concentration can therefore be regarded primarily as a signal identifying the at risk elderly patient who would suffer worse outcomes and requires careful assessment and monitoring for whom nutritional support and Inflammation detection may be needed as part of the treatment plan 
As observational study was susceptible to various confounders  we adjusted many variables that may affect the relationship between prealbumin and in hospital outcomes to minimize potential confounding 
In addition  we tested the robustness of the results by repeating the analyses in different subgroups of gender  age  history of hypertension and history of diabetes Our study has some limitations 
First  by including patients still in hospital as of J February     the case fatality ratio in our study cannot reflect the true mortality of elderly COVID 
Second  the record of data may be affected by prehospital medication and the time interval between admission and onset 
Third  since all subjects in our study were hospitalized Chinese elderly patients diagnosed with COVID  results of this study might not directly be applied to other ethnicities and age groups In conclusion  this retrospective cohort study revealed that the prealbumin is an independent risk factor for the in hospital mortality in the Chinese COVID  elderly patients 
Nutritional support and Inflammation detection should be careful assessment and monitoring for the elderly patients with low prealbumin concentration

Coping With COVID  Emergency Stress  Secondary Trauma and Self Efficacy in Healthcare and Emergency Workers in ItalyThe coronavirus disease  COVID  or the acute respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus    SARS CoV  began spreading in China at the end of   and  to date  represents an international health emergency without precedents in terms of its health  economic  and organizational effects on people s lives  World Health Organization   
After China  Italy was the first country to be affected by this epidemic  with the first deaths on February     and a rapid increase in the spread of infection and mortality 
COVID  was first detected in Northern Italy  and it then spread  although at different rates of incidence  to the other regions 
It was immediately evident that healthcare and emergency workers were at great risk of contagion and that protection and intervention protocols needed to be introduced in the absence of adequate points of reference because of the exceptional nature of the epidemic  the rate of spread of the infection  the seriousness of patients  health condition  and the mortality index 
The extreme conditions in which health workers have had to work  especially in the most affected regions in Northern Italy  are indicated by the following data from the Italian National Institute of Health   over   doctors died and   other health workers were infected within the general context of the population of   deaths and   infections in a span of   weeks 
It was also clear that the medical staff would experience serious psychological repercussions because of the working conditions as well as the difficulty of having scientific points of reference on care and intervention procedures 
To this must be added the increase in workload  the extension of working hours and  for health workers  the frequent exposure to the suffering and death of their patients 
Therefore  healthcare and emergency workers were subjected to serious psychological as well as physical stress 
Hence  the aim of this study  which was also the aim of a previous study  Vagni et al    is to focus on the similarities and the differences in the stress management of two professional groups healthcare and emergency workers during the acute phase of the pandemic 
Both groups have had to deal with COVID patients as frontline responders and have been exposed to the related risks of infection and psychological consequences  which  to date  have not been examined in detail through a comparative analysis As regards the stress that they experience  the literature clearly explains that healthcare and emergency workers who intervene in emergency situations are exposed to the risk of developing dysfunctional reactions that can be identified at different levels physical and or physiological  e g  psychosomatic disorders  sleep wake cycle alterations  and sense of tiredness  emotional  e g  irritability  nervousness  agitation  anger  low self esteem  and guilt  cognitive  e g  distractibility  sense of ineffectiveness  and negative anticipation of events  and relational  e g  increase in conflicts within emergency teams and or with their organization institution  and social withdrawal and may also develop reactions from secondary trauma  Del Missier et al    Sbattella    Argentero and Setti    Fraccaroli and Balducci    Bellelli and Di Schiena    Walton et al   
Faced with stressful events regarding which they lack previous experience and specific  necessary knowledge  and which cause tension owing to the need for rapid decision timings and a sense of responsibility  emergency workers may experience a sense of decision ineffectiveness 
In fact  emergency situations are characterized by high levels of decisional and operational uncertainty with associated regret and guilt  Del Missier et al   Several studies have highlighted that insufficient instructions and a lack of personal protective equipment  PPE  are important predictors of stress for healthcare and emergency workers in large scale emergencies  Oh et al    Du et al    El Hage et al    Walton et al   
Oh et al 
  highlighted that nurses involved in managing the Middle East respiratory syndrome  MERS  experienced lower levels of stress when the levels of goods supply and hospital training were higher 
Some studies have highlighted that frontline healthcare workers had lower secondary traumatization scores than non frontline health workers and the general public in contrast to the findings of previous research on the SARS outbreak in the same area in Singapore  Chan and Huak   
According to Barleycorn   and Tan et al 
  these results may be due to the dedicated training and psychological support given to healthcare workers after the SARS outbreak and demonstrate the validity of policy strategies for prevention of stress in the psychological health field An analysis of   studies published from January to March   aimed at investigating the stress experience of healthcare workers in facing COVID  shows that health workers experienced symptoms of depression and anxiety related to this stressful experience 
Moreover  the severity of their symptoms was influenced by their age  gender  role  specialization  type of activity performed  and exposure to patients with COVID  however  prevention  resilience  and social support interventions mediated their response to stress  Bohlken et al   
In a review of the literature  Spoorthy   underlined that sociodemographic variables  such as age  gender  profession  and workplace  and psychological variables  such as poor social support and self efficacy  affect the stress level experienced by health workers 
In addition  COVID  emerged as an independent stress risk factor 
Xiao et al 
  found that social support plays a role in reducing the anxiety levels in medical staff and increases their sense of self efficacy According to Walton et al 
  the specific stressors that health workers face in the COVID  emergency are related to the organizational context 
The challenges for medical staff include not only an increased workload but also a fear of infection  the need to work with new protocols that change frequently  and the use of PPE 
In uncontrollable situations such as a pandemic  when specific action protocols are absent and limited resources are available  health workers must make individual decisions with a heavy burden of responsibility that may be contrary to their moral principles 
For example  in the case of COVID  they may have to choose which patients to save because only a few places are available in intensive care 
In this regard  Cai et al 
  showed that for a sample of   healthcare professionals who worked closely with COVID  patients in Hubei  the most stressful factors were the lack of protocols for the treatment of COVID  the scarcity of PPE  the exhausting work shifts  their concern about the risk of infection  and their exposure to the death and suffering of their patients 
They also found that the support of superiors proved to be one of the most important motivational factors for medical staff  and the presence of clear guidelines and effective safety protocols were protective factors against the development of stress  in particular  for females 
Further  Walton et al 
  identified the organizational stressors as the changes in work shifts  the prevalence of night shifts  an excessive workload  staff roles  autonomy  the lack of support from superiors  and the absence of adequate information and clear instructions 
On the basis of these stressors  they estimated that   of the medical staff working on the front line of this pandemic are at risk of developing post traumatic stress disorder  PTSD 
In addition  limited resources  longer shifts  decreased hours of rest  and the occupational risks associated with COVID  exposure have increased the physical and mental fatigue  stress  anxiety  and burnout of these staff members  Sasangohar et al   The loss of a social support network  which can be an important resilience factor  is another risk factor  Ozbay et al   
In the COVID  emergency  healthcare and emergency workers have often experienced a separation from their affective links  either because of the restrictions on social contacts imposed by the lockdown or the fear of spreading the infection to their family members 
To this must be added that although  at first  health workers received unanimous encouragement from the population  later  they also experienced demonstrations of stigma and isolation 
Some studies have shown that being able to resort to their own social support network is a significant protective factor for health workers dealing with this emergency  Cai et al   As Favretto   stated  when individuals experience situations that go beyond their coping strategies  their vulnerability to  and risk of developing  psychopathological reactions increases 
Studies conducted during previous epidemics  such as the SARS  MERS  and Ebola epidemics  converge in detecting how healthcare and emergency workers may experience extremely high levels of stress and even develop secondary traumatic stress or vicarious trauma 
This trauma is defined as an experience of symptoms similar to those found in people with PTSD  such as in emergency nurses working with traumatized patients  Beck   
Figley   defined it as a form of stress that derives from the feelings of empathy experienced when helping traumatized people 
The symptoms may include intrusive recurring thoughts  disturbed sleep  fatigue  physical symptoms  hyperarousal  increased stress response  anxiety  depression  and feeling emotional  Adriaenssens et al   
Wolf et al 
  described how nurses may feel  overwhelmed  and this condition becomes a source of moral distress that triggers feelings of powerlessness  guilt  fear  anger  and frustration The sense of frustration and impotence felt by nurses when they are unable to treat and save a patient has been highlighted as a risk factor for secondary traumatic stress in several studies  Missouridou   
Avoidance and emotional numbing can become tools for self protection from intrusive symptoms that exceed the personal tolerance level  Coetzee and Klopper    Mealer and Jones   
Their frustration obviously intensifies on a patient s death 
The onset of PTSD in the health workers involved in treating MERS was also detected after the acute phase of the emergency was over  highlighting a risk not only in the immediate period but also in the medium term period  Lee et al   In reference to COVID  updated studies conducted on Chinese health workers have already highlighted the strong impact of the epidemic on the psychological health of doctors and nurses 
Some studies have found that healthcare workers have high levels of anxiety  depression  insomnia  and distress  Lai et al    Li et al    Zhu et al   
In particular  female professionals with more than   years of experience and previous psychiatric pathology present more risk factors of developing the symptoms of stress  anxiety  and depression  Lai et al    Zhu et al   
Huang J 
Z  et al 
  studied stress levels during the COVID  emergency in a sample of medical staff 
They found that females showed higher levels of anxiety and PTSD than males did and that the levels were higher for nurses than for doctors 
Moreover  Li et al 
  found that nurses had developed higher levels of vicarious trauma than those of the general population and that nurses who did not work closely with COVID  patients showed a more severe symptomatology  both physical and psychological  compared with their colleagues working on the frontline emergency services 
In Italy  a study conducted on healthcare workers found that doctors and nurses developed high levels of stress and anxiety  greater than those developed by the general population  and that healthcare workers operating in the North  the area of Italy most affected by the virus  showed a more severe symptomatology  Simione and Gnagnarella   
This study also confirmed that females tend to have a greater perception of the risk of infection  which increases their risk of developing the symptoms of anxiety and distress Because of their long  intense exposure to various stressors  it is important to note the nature of the coping strategies used by these healthcare and emergency workers in these situations and their effectiveness in terms of reducing and effectively coping with stress 
Indeed  the effective management of stress levels in the acute emergency phase could reduce the risk of developing long term PTSD or other pathologies  such as anxiety and depression  Fullerton et al    Slottje et al    Argentero and Setti    Sakuma et al    Birinci and Erden    Li et al   
Coping may be defined as a series of cognitive and behavioral efforts to manage specific internal or external issues that test or exceed individual resources  Lazarus and Folkman   
A distinction can be made between problem focused and emotion focused coping strategies 
The former is aimed at modifying and solving the stressful situation through active interventions 
By contrast  emotion focused coping is aimed at managing the emotions connected to the stressful event and regulating affective reactions  such as anxiety and the tension of response to stress  for example  by trying to avoid the threat  denial  or re evaluating it  reappraisal The choice of coping strategies is influenced by the individual s cognitive evaluation of the event  termed secondary evaluation  which involves estimating the resources available and the most effective strategies to deal with the situation  Lazarus and Folkman   
A key element of this assessment is the extent to which the individual can maintain control over the outcome of the situation 
The literature indicates that individuals apply dysfunctional coping when they face an uncontrollable event by responding primarily with a coping strategy focused on the problem  and conversely  when they face a controllable situation  they respond with coping strategies focused on emotions  Strentz and Auerbach    Vitaliano et al   
A coping strategy may be defined as adaptive when the controllability of the stressful event corresponds with the choice of coping strategy  in this case  the subject will experience fewer symptoms related to stress  Park et al   The strategies used to cope with trauma may differ among individuals  but they can also vary according to the profession and the features of the traumatic event  Nydegger et al   
Individuals differ in their choice of coping strategies  Connor Smith and Flachsbart    and factors related to the situation can also have a decisive influence on such choice  Brown et al   
A few studies have considered the ways in which gender influences the perception of stress in emergency situations and the choice of coping strategy 
These studies highlight that females tend to perceive events as more negative and uncontrollable and to resort more to coping strategies focused on emotions and avoidance  whereas males tend to resort more to applying problem focused coping and to inhibiting emotions  Matud    Matud et al    Matud and Garcia   The literature on the relationship between coping strategies and the stress levels of emergency workers has shown that the use of coping strategies focused on the problem usually tends to correlate with lower stress levels  both in healthcare workers  Watson et al    Howlett et al    and in other emergency workers  such as firefighters  Brown et al   
However  a coping strategy frequently used by emergency workers is that of avoidance and minimization  and this strategy is associated with higher levels of stress  Brown et al    Chang et al    Kerai et al    Witt et al    Theleritis et al   
Loo et al 
  found that in a group of emergency workers  avoidance as well as coping strategies focused on emotions were associated with the development of post traumatic symptomatology 
Rodríguez Rey et al 
  revealed that among health workers working in a pediatric emergency department  approximately   of the variance in PTSD was explained by the frequent use of coping strategies focused on emotions and the infrequent use of those focused on the problem 
In addition  Kucmin et al 
  who considered a sample of   paramedics  highlighted that the risk of developing PTSD symptoms was predicted by the use of coping strategies focused on emotions However  the literature does not offer unanimous results 
Chamberlin and Green   found that in a group of firefighters  all coping strategies actually correlated with high levels of stress  the authors explained this finding by suggesting that it is not the individual coping strategies that are maladaptive in themselves  but that greater effort is needed to adjust in stressful situations 
By contrast  Young et al 
  indicated that firefighters use problem focused coping strategies more often at the beginning of the operation and emotion focused coping strategies more commonly in the phase of breakdown and fatigue 
However  after the incident  they use both strategies  Young et al   
A meta analysis by Shin et al 
  highlighted that different coping strategies have different effects on work burnout  in particular  emotional stress and depersonalization are associated with the use of emotion focused coping strategies  whereas professional ineffectiveness is associated with the use of problem focused strategies Further  a few studies have investigated the coping strategies that emergency workers can use during health emergencies similar to COVID 
Maunder et al 
  revealed that healthcare professionals who tended to apply dysfunctional coping strategies  based on avoidance  hostile comparison  or self blame  tended to develop higher stress levels 
Wong et al 
  highlighted that during the SARS epidemic  doctors and nurses tended to use different coping strategies 
The doctors tended to turn more to action planning  but this strategy did not affect their stress level 
Instead  their stress level was positively correlated with their use of coping strategies based on emotional outlets 
By contrast  the nursing staff tended to resort more to behavioral disengagement and distraction strategies  which  however  correlated with higher levels of stress among them In this regard  during the MERS epidemic  hospital staff tended to adopt coping strategies related to the use of PPE and the adoption of all prevention measures  as well as social support  whereas the coping strategy that they adopted the least was that based on an emotional outlet  Khalid et al   
A recent study on healthcare workers in Hubei  China  during the COVID  epidemic  Cai et al    yielded similar results  to reduce stress  the medical staff tended to rely on active coping strategies  such as using security protocols  practicing social isolation measures  and seeking support from family and friends  but they did not find it necessary to discuss their emotions with a professional 
Huang L  et al 
  found that a sample of nurses working during the COVID  emergency presented greater emotional reactions and turned more to problem focused coping compared with university nursing students 
Emergency workers must have sufficient self efficacy in terms of their coping skills to be able to manage and cope with stress levels 
Self efficacy in coping appears to be an effective protective factor in relation to stress levels and maladaptive responses  Chesney et al   
Self efficacy to cope with traumatic events has been effective in reducing the risk of developing PTSD  Bosmans et al   The main objective of this study is to identify the coping strategies activated by healthcare and emergency workers to deal with stress factors related to the COVID  emergency that may be associated with the risk of developing vicarious or secondary trauma 
Few studies have considered both groups simultaneously when analyzing the strategies they have adopted to manage stress during the COVID  emergency 
Hence  in this study  we are interested in detecting the similarities and differences in the approaches they adopted to manage their stress during the acute phase of the current pandemic According to Walton et al 
  the main acute stress reactions of emergency workers to emergency medical situations are emotional  cognitive  physical  and social reactions 
Therefore  these factors were included in the questionnaire used in the present study 
Moreover  reactions linked to stress factors for difficulties due to ineffective decision making and dealing with stress were also considered  Chesney et al   
In addition  fears regarding contracting the virus and infecting their own families because of COVID  were specifically considered  Du et al    Huang J 
Z  et al    Ornell et al    Walton et al   Based on results found in the literature  the specific objectives of this study are as follows Participants were selected on a voluntary basis through a trasversal sampling in order to take a picture of the situation caused by the pandemic emergency 
We used an internet platform to conduct the study and approached the participants using social media  dedicated mailing lists  and forums 
Participants from all Italian regions completed the questionnaire online 
The sample consists of   participants  males   and   females  whose average age was   years  SD     min   – max  
Further    of the sample were married    were separated  and the remaining   were single 
We selected various professional figures who had directly worked in various sectors during the COVID  emergency and who could be divided into two main groups 
The first  the  Health Group  consists of   participants   who were healthcare workers    doctors     nurses     psychologists   and seven healthcare assistants  
Their average age was   years  SD     and their average years of active professional service was    SD    
The second  the  Emergency Group  consists of   participants     emergency workers     firefighters   and   Civil Protection staff   whose average age was   years  SD     and average years of service was    SD    
There was an age difference between the two groups  t     p   and the distribution of the gender variable differed between the two groups  with   males and   females in the Health Group and   males and   females in the Emergency Group  χ    p    
The study involved participants from the entire national territory  and their workplace could be divided as follows      and   were from North  Central  and South Italy  respectively 
Further    of the sample worked directly with COVID  patients and   worked in specific COVID  departments 
Among the healthcare workers    had worked in direct contact with COVID  patients  whereas among the emergency workers  only   had assisted these patients  χ    p    
In the present study  we included two variables  lack of necessary instructions and lack of PPE  in accordance with the findings in the literature on their impact on the stress reactions of healthcare and emergency workers during the COVID  pandemic 
Among the participants    and   of healthcare and emergency workers  respectively  did not have sufficient instructions to intervene  χ    p n s 
  and   and   of healthcare and emergency workers  respectively  lacked adequate PPE when working  χ    p n s 
 This study used an online questionnaire and was conducted during the lockdown period owing to the COVID  pandemic 
The questionnaire had three parts  one each to collect online informed consent and baseline sociodemographic information  and one with an online series of questionnaires  as described in the next section 
Participants  anonymity was maintained in collecting the data 
The institutional Ethics Committee approved all the procedures This instrument s   items enable verification of the presence of two symptoms of vicarious trauma  Intrusion and Arousal  and their relative frequency 
The STSS was built on the basis of the conceptualization expressed in the DSM   American Psychiatric Association    regarding the characteristic PTSD symptoms 
In detail  the Arousal items describe situations characterized by anxiety  confusion  physical and psychological complaints  and agitation 
Intrusion refers to the re experiencing of the traumatic event even if not directly suffered through internal images and memories 
Instructions for the STSS I indicated that respondents should specify how frequently an item was true for them in the previous   weeks 
The statements are evaluated on a  point scale     never      very often  that provides scores for Intrusion  example items   I thought about my work with victims when I didn t intend to   Reminders of my work with clients upset me  and Arousal  example items   I had trouble concentrating   I was easily annoyed   I expected something bad to happen   I felt jumpy 
The reliability coefficients of the instrument are   and   for Arousal and Intrusion  respectively This is a  item measure of perceived self efficacy for coping with challenges and threats 
This measure focuses on the changes in individuals  confidence in their ability to cope effectively  based on the self efficacy theory  Bandura    Chesney et al   
Participants were asked   When things aren t going well for you  or when you re having problems  how confident or certain are you that you can do the following  Then  they were asked to rate on an  point scale the extent to which they believed they could perform important behaviors for adaptive coping 
The instrument yields three subscale scores   problem focused coping   α      stop unpleasant emotions and thoughts   α     and  support   α    
Anchor points on the scale are    cannot do at all     moderately certain can do  and    certain can do We constructed an ad hoc  item questionnaire that included Yes No questions to detect stress factors identified by the literature  such as the availability of suitable equipment and the receipt of clear instructions during the COVID  coping experience 
In this study  we present the results related to two of these items   Instructions  which refers to having received the necessary instructions to intervene  and  Equipment  which refers to having PPE 
Predictions of these factors have also been made in other studies  Du et al    Walton et al   
In light of the relevance and specificity of the lack of clear information or instructions and adequate PPE in the management of COVID  in the Italian context  as well as the findings in other studies  we decided to focus attention on these two risk factors Our analysis of the literature revealed that in situations in which they have to cope with a pandemic  several factors may affect the stress of medical staff and emergency healthcare workers and that COVID  represents an independent specific stressor  Spoorthy   
These stress factors have been identified as frequently affecting healthcare and emergency workers in emergency situations and leading to physical  emotional  cognitive  decision making  relational  and organizational stress  Del Missier et al    Sbattella    Argentero and Setti    Fraccaroli and Balducci    Bellelli and Di Schiena    Du et al    Walton et al   
Focusing on the specificity of the COVID  epidemic  items have been constructed regarding the fears of contracting the infection and of infecting colleagues or family members  Walton et al    since COVID  represents a factor of independent stress  Spoorthy    that has great impact  Huang J 
Z  et al   
Consequently  we constructed the ESQ consisting of   items assessed on a  point Likert scale  with scores ranging from    not at all  to    very much  grouped into six scales 
The participants were asked to indicate how often they experienced certain emotions and thoughts while performing intervention and emergency activities during the COVID  pandemic The scales correspond to the factors identified and confirmed by factorial analysis through an analysis of the main components with orthogonal rotation of factors  varimax 
The number of factors to be extracted was initially verified through the unit s largest eigenvalue criterion and  subsequently  by the scree test 
The ESQ is based on six scales The ESQ demonstrated good internal consistency  α     overall and for each individual scale  Organizational–Relational Stress  α     Physical Stress  α     Inefficacy Decisional Stress  α     Emotional Stress  α     Cognitive stress  α     and COVID  Stress  α    First  we performed Pearson s correlation analyses to identify the associations between the variables for the two groups that we considered in this study 
Subsequently  we checked for significant differences between the two groups as their stress levels  coping strategies  and secondary trauma 
We used hierarchical linear regression models to verify the predictive effect of the risk factors  lack of adequate information and PPE  on the different stress levels  in step  
Then  we verified the protective effect of the coping strategies  in step  
The models were controlled for age  gender  and group 
Lastly  we used hierarchical regression models to verify the predictive effect of stress factors on the components of secondary trauma 
The models were controlled for age  gender  and group First  we conducted correlational analyses and comparisons of averages on the reference sample 
Table   shows the correlations between the scales of the ESQ and the other instruments Preliminary comparisons were made through the Student s t test between the Health Group and the Emergency Group in relation to the ESQ  CSES SF  and STSS I scores 
Table   shows the comparison between the two groups As shown in Table   significant differences emerged between the two groups in relation to their Stress and Arousal levels 
The results indicate higher levels of both for the Health Group  and that emergency workers turn more to the Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts strategy 
Further  we performed comparisons with reference to the gender variable to detect differences in the levels of stress factors  coping strategies  and secondary trauma 
Females reported significantly higher Physical Stress than males did  Females  M     SD     Males  M     SD     t     p     as well as Emotional Stress  Females  M     SD     Males  M     SD     t     p     and COVID  Stress  Females  M     SD     Males  M     SD     t     p    
No gender difference emerged in coping strategies and secondary trauma 
Within the Health Group  there were significant differences regarding Inefficacy Decisional Stress  F     p     Doctor M     SD     Psychologist M     SD     average difference     p     and COVID  Stress  F     p     Nurse M     SD     Doctor M     SD     difference     p    
Within the Emergency Group  there were no differences in levels of stress and secondary trauma or coping strategies 
Moreover  we found similar correlations between the two groups for the Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts strategy and the stress factors  whereas for the other two coping strategies  we found a different association  particularly for the Emergency Group 
However  the t test comparisons highlight differences only at the level of the Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts strategy 
Given the findings of the preliminary analyses  we considered it necessary to include the age  gender  and group variables to test the predictiveness of the coping strategies on the participants  stress levels To test the predictive effect of the coping strategies on various levels of stress  hierarchical regression was conducted 
Considering the Age and Gender differences within the groups  we included these variables in all models together with the Group variable  Health vs 
Emergency  and the  Instructions  and  Equipment  variables 
The models generated by assuming the ESQ scales as dependent variables are shown in Table  
Regarding the coping strategies  we observed an important effect of the Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts Coping strategy on all the stress scales  except for Physical Stress where the effect of the Focused Problem Coping strategy is recorded As shown in Table   significant negative associations between stressors and secondary trauma were found for both groups 
The hierarchical regression models of stress scales were analyzed for the Arousal and Intrusion levels of secondary trauma 
The models included the Age  Gender  Health Emergency Group variables  and the ESQ scales 
The results are shown in Table  The same regression models were generated by including coping strategies as predictors and were analyzed by Age  Gender  and Health Emergency Group 
Compared with Arousal  the Health Emergency Group and Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts are predictive  R    F     p     Beta  ∗∗∗  Beta  ∗  respectively 
Compared with Intrusion  only the Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts variable  R    F     p     Beta  ∗  assumes significance This study has several limitations 
The first is the limited sample size 
The second is that our study involved participants in the very midst of the COVID  emergency  which means that the level of stress in healthcare workers may have been more severe and acute 
Moreover  the long term psychological implications for the healthcare and emergency population should be investigated for the presence of a full secondary trauma 
Therefore  a large sized longitudinal study is called for to further explore the pathogenesis of vicarious traumatization 
The third is that participants were not selected based on whether they had existing psychological problems 
In proposing the hypothesis of this study  we anticipated that we would be able to discover the relationships between coping strategies  emergency related stress  and secondary trauma in healthcare and emergency workers and commenced our investigation by assuming that the impact of stress can provoke psychological consequences in emergency situations 
In future work  this assumption could be tested to verify whether an emergency situation has a different impact on workers who have already experienced psychological problems The raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors  without undue reservation  to any qualified researcher The studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by Comitato Etico per la Sperimentazione Umana – CESU of the University of Urbino

All authors contributed to the article and approved the submitted version The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest Recombination Every Day  Abundant Recombination in a Virus during a Single Multi Cellular Host InfectionAs increasing numbers of full length viral sequences become available  recombinant or mosaic viruses are being recognized more frequently   
Recombination events have been demonstrated to be associated with viruses expanding their host range   or increasing their virulence    thus accompanying  or perhaps even being at the origin of  major changes during virus adaptation 
It remains unclear  however  whether recombination events represent a highly frequent and significant phenomenon in the everyday life of these viruses Viruses can exchange genetic material when at least two different viral genomes co infect the same host cell 
Progeny can then become hybrid through different mechanisms  such as reassortment of segments when the parental genomes are fragmented    intra molecular recombination when polymerases switch templates  in RNA viruses     or homologous or non homologous recombination  in both RNA and DNA viruses 
Quantification of viral recombination in multi cellular organisms has been attempted under two distinct experimental approaches  in vitro  in cell cultures     and in vivo  in live hosts    
The in vitro approach  which has so far been applied only to animal viruses  allows the establishment of the  intrinsic  recombination rate in experimentally co infected cells in cell cultures   
However  it does not necessarily reflect the situation in entire  living hosts  where the frequency of co infected cells is poorly known and depends on many factors such as the size of the pathogen population  the relative frequency and distribution of the different variants  and host defense mechanisms preventing secondary infection of cells 
The in vivo experimental approach is closer to biological conditions and may thus be more informative of what actually happens in  the real world However  as discussed below  numerous experimental constraints have so far precluded an actual quantification of the baseline rate of recombination 
First  many experimental designs have used extreme positive selection  where only recombinant genomes were viable  e g    
Other studies did not use complementation techniques but detected recombinants by PCR within infected hosts or tissues    which provides information on their presence but not on their frequency in the viral population 
So far  no quantitative PCR or other quantitative method has been applied to evaluate the number of recombinants appearing in an experimentally infected live host 
Finally  recent methods based on sequence analysis inferred the population recombination rate  rather than the individual recombination rate   
While results from these methods certainly take in vivo recombination into account  there are other caveats  isolates have often been collected in different hosts sometimes in different geographical regions and sometimes the selective neutrality of sequence variation on which these estimates are based is not clearly established 
Estimates from such studies by essence address the estimation of the recombination rate at a different evolutionary scale Taken together  the currently available information indicates that no viral recombination rate has ever been estimated directly at time and space scales corresponding to a single multi cellular host infection  although this level is most significant for the biology and evolution of viruses 
This study intends to fill this gap by evaluating the recombination frequency of the cauliflower mosaic virus  CaMV  during a single passage in one of its host plants  the turnip Brassica rapa CaMV is a pararetrovirus  which is a major grouping containing hepadnaviruses  e g  hepatitis B virus  badnaviruses  e g  banana streak virus  and caulimoviruses  e g  CaMV 
Pararetroviruses are characterized by a non segmented double stranded DNA genome 
After entering the host cell nucleus  the viral DNA accumulates as a minichromosome   whose transcription is ensured by the host RNA polymerase II   
The CaMV genome consists in approximately   bp and encodes six viral gene products that have been detected in planta  Figure     
Viral proteins P  to P  are expressed from two major transcripts  namely a  S RNA  encoding P  and a  S RNA corresponding to the entire genome and serving as mRNA for proteins P –P    
Using the pre genomic  S RNA as a matrix  the protein P   product of gene V  reverse transcribes the genome into genomic DNA that is concomitantly encapsidated   The detection of CaMV recombinants in turnip hosts has been reported numerous times 
Some studies have demonstrated the appearance of infectious recombinant viral genomes after inoculation  i  of a host plant with two infectious or non infectious parental clones   or  ii  of a transgenic plant containing one CaMV transgene with a CaMV genome missing the corresponding genomic region   
While the former revealed inter genomic viral recombination  the latter demonstrated that CaMV can also recombine with transgenes within the host s genome 
Another study based on phylogenetic analyses of various CaMV strains has clearly suggested different origins for different genomic regions and  hence  multiple recombination events during the evolution of this virus   
Indirect experimental evidence has indicated that  in some cases  CaMV recombination could occur within the host nucleus  between different viral minichromosomes  presumably through the action of the DNA repair cellular machinery   
Nevertheless  the mechanism of  template switching  during reverse transcription  predominant in all retroviruses  most certainly also applies to pararetroviruses 
For this reason  and on the basis of numerous experimental data  CaMV is generally believed to recombine mostly in the cytoplasm of the host cell  by  legal  template switching between two pre genomic RNA molecules    or  illegal  template switching between the  S and the  S RNA   
Under this hypothesis  recombination in CaMV could therefore be considered as operating on a linear template during reverse transcription  with the  ′ and  ′ extremities later ligated to circularize the genomic DNA  position   in Figure  
The above cited studies clearly demonstrate that CaMV is able to recombine 
However  since these studies are based on complementation techniques  non quantitative detection  or phylogenetically based inferences of recombination  they do not inform us on whether recombination is an exceptional event or an  everyday  process shaping the genetic composition of CaMV populations In the present work  we aimed at answering this question 
To this end  we have constructed a CaMV genome with four genetic markers  demonstrated to be neutral in competition experiments 
By co inoculating host plants with equal amounts of wild type and marker containing CaMV particles  we have generated mixed populations in which impressive proportions of recombinants distributed in several different classes corresponding to exchange of different genomic regions have been detected and quantified 
Altogether  the recombinant genomes averaged over   of the population 
Further analysis of these data  assuming a number of viral replications during the infection period ranging from five to   indicates that the per nucleotide per replication cycle recombination rate of CaMV is of the same order of magnitude  i e  on the order of a few   across the entire genome 
We thereby provide the first quantification  to our knowledge  of the recombination rate in a virus population during a single passage in a single host From Figure   and supposing that all marker containing genomic regions can recombine  we could predict the detection and quantification of seven classes of recombinant genotypes   bcd a  a cd b  ab d c  abc d   cd ab  a d bc  and a c b d 
Indeed  all classes were detected  and their frequencies in the ten CaMV populations analyzed are summarized in Table  Altogether  the proportion of recombinant genomes found in the mixed viral populations was astonishingly high and very similar in the ten co infected plants analyzed  Table   last column  ranging between    plant   to    plants     and   with a mean frequency   standard error  of      
This result indicates that recombination events are very frequent during the invasion of the host plant by CaMV and represents  to our knowledge  the first direct quantification of viral recombination during the infection of a live multi cellular host The inferred per generation recombination and interference rates  assuming that CaMV undergoes ten replication cycles during the   d between infection and sampling  are given for each of the ten plants in Table  
Recombination rates between adjacent markers are large  on the order of   to  
Taking the distance in nucleotides between markers into account yields an average recombination rate per nucleotide and generation on the order of      
Interestingly  this recombination rate does not vary throughout the genome  Kruskal–Wallis test  p    To relax the assumption of the number of replications during the   d  we calculated the recombination parameters assuming five or   generations 
The effect of the number of generations on the estimates is linear  doubling the number of generations results in a halving of the recombination rate  detailed results not shown 
For example  the average recombination rates r
  r
  and r
  assuming   generations were equal to     and   respectively  compare with values in Table   yielding per nucleotide per generation recombination rates of             and      Inspection of Table   also shows that first order interference coefficients were in general negative  indicating that a crossing over in one genomic segment increases the probability that a crossing over will occur in another genomic segment  while the second order coefficient parameter had an average value close to zero with a large variance 
The mechanism leading to these results will be discussed in the following section One major breakthrough in the work presented here lies in the space and time scales at which the experiments were performed 
Indeed  the processes occurring within the course of a single infection of one multi cellular host are of obvious biological relevance for any disease 
Previous studies on viral recombination suffered from major drawbacks in this respect  basing their conclusions on experiments relying on complementation among non infectious viruses or between viruses with undetermined relative fitness  on phylogenetically based analyses  or on experiments in cell cultures 
For reasons detailed in the Introduction  the first two methods either do not provide information on the frequency of recombination  but only its occurrence  or address the question at a different temporal  and often spatial  scale 
Results from cell cultures  on the other hand  impose cell co infection by different viral variants  potentially overestimating the frequency of recombination events 
Our study circumvents these limitations by analyzing viral genotypes sampled from infected plants after the course of a single infection  and therefore the invasion and co infection of cells in various organs and tissues is very close to natural More than half of the genomes       see Table   present in a CaMV population after a single passage in its host plant were identified as recombinants  and these data allowed us to infer a per nucleotide per generation recombination rate on the order of       to      
The time length of one generation  i e  the time required for a given genome to go from one replication to the next  is totally unknown in plant viruses 
The only experimental data available on CaMV are based on the kinetics of gene expression in infected protoplasts  where the capsid protein is produced between   and   h   
The reverse transcription and the encapsidation of genomic DNA being two coupled phenomena    we judged it reasonable to assume a generation time of   d and  thus  an average of ten generations during our experiments 
In case this estimate is mistaken  we have verified a linear relationship between r and the number of generations  thereby allowing an immediate adjustment of r if the CaMV generation time is more precisely established 
At this point  we must consider that all cloned genomes may not have been through all the successive replication events potentially allowed by the timing of our experiments 
It was previously shown that about   of CaMV mature virus particles accumulate in compact inclusion bodies    where they may be sequestered for a long time  as such inclusions are very frequent in all infected cells  including those in leaves that have been invaded by the virus population for several weeks 
The viral population may thus present an age structure that could bias the estimation of the recombination rate 
In order to minimize this bias  the clones we analyzed were collected in one young newly formed leaf  where the chances of finding genomes from  unsequestered lines  were assumed to be higher 
In any case  our data analysis is conservative  since this age structure can only lead to an underestimation of the recombination rate Our results show that interferences between pairs of loci are negative  a recombination event between two loci apparently increases the probability of recombination between another pair of loci 
We believe that the most parsimonious explanation of these negative interferences is based on the way the infection builds up within plant hosts 
Indeed  one can divide infected host cells into those infected by a single virus genotype and those infected by more than one viral genotype 
In the former  analogous to clonal propagation  recombination is undetectable 
In the latter  recombination is not only detectable but  as our results indicate  very frequent 
Samples consisting of viruses resulting from a mixture of these two types of host cell infections will thus contain viruses with no recombination and viruses with several recombination events  thus yielding an impression of negative interference 
These conceptual arguments are supported by mathematical models 
It is indeed easy to show  detailed results not shown  that if a proportion F of the population reproduces clonally  analogous to single infections  while the remaining reproduces panmictically  negative interferences could be inferred even if they do not exist 
For example  assuming a three locus model with real recombination rates r
  and r
  and interference i
  the  apparent  recombination and interference parameters  would be r
        F r  r
        F r
  and i
     F   i
    F 
Interestingly  this example also shows that our estimates of the recombination rate are conservative  that a fraction F of host cells are singly infected while others are multiply infected leads to an underestimation of the recombination rate As judged by r
  r
  and r
  calculated between markers a–b  b–c  and c–d  respectively  we found evidence for recombination through the entire CaMV genome 
The values for r
 
r
  and r
  are remarkably similar  hence the recombination sites seem to be evenly distributed along the genome 
We considered the template switching model as the major way recombinants are created in CaMV 
As already mentioned in the Introduction  hot spots of template switching have been predicted at the position of the  ′ extremities of the  S and  S RNAs   
If other recombination mechanisms  such as that associated with second strand DNA synthesis or with the host cell DNA repair machinery  act significantly  hot spots would be expected at the positions of the sequence interruption     and     
Due to the design of our experiment and the position of the four markers  we have no information on putative hot spots at positions corresponding to the  ′ end of the  S RNA and to    at nucleotide position  
Nevertheless  the putative hot spots at the  ′ end of the  S RNA and at   and    nucleotide positions   and   respectively  fall between marker pairs c–d  b–c  and a–b  respectively 
Our results indicate that either these hot spots are quantitatively equivalent though predicted by different recombination mechanisms or  more likely  that they simply do not exist 
Whatever the explanation  what we observe is that the CaMV can exchange any portion of its genome  and thus any gene thereof  with an astonishingly high frequency during the course of a single host infection To our knowledge  the viral recombination rate has never previously been quantified experimentally for a plant virus   
In contrast  retroviruses and particularly HIV  have been extensively investigated in that sense 
As we have already discussed for these latter cases  the quantification of the intrinsic recombination rate was carried out in artificially co infected cell cultures 
The estimated intrinsic per nucleotide per generation recombination rate in HIV  is on the order of      less than one order of magnitude higher than our estimation for CaMV 
Because for various reasons detailed above we probably underestimate the within host CaMV recombination rate  we believe that the intrinsic recombination rate in CaMV is higher and perhaps on the order of that of HIV Other pararetroviruses such as plant badnaviruses or vertebrate hepadnaviruses have a similar cycle within their host cells  including steps of nuclear minichromosome  genomic size RNA synthesis  and reverse transcription and encapsidation 
Nevertheless  vertebrate hepadnaviruses  e g  hepatitis B virus  infect hosts that are very different from plants in their biology and physiology  and this could lead to a totally different frequency of cell co infection during the development of the virus populations 
Thus  even though our results can be informative for other pararetroviruses because of the viruses  shared biological characteristics  they should not be extrapolated to vertebrate pararetroviruses without caution We used the plasmid pCa  which is the complete genome of the CaMV isolate Cabb S  cloned into the pBR  plasmid at the unique SalI restriction site   
To analyze recombination in different regions of the genome  we introduced four genetic markers  a  b  c  and d  at the positions       and   respectively  thus approximately at four cardinal points of the CaMV circular double stranded DNA of   bp  Figure  
All markers  each corresponding to a single nucleotide change  were introduced by PCR directed mutagenesis in pCa  and resulted in the duplication of previously unique restriction sites BsiWI  PstI  MluI  and SacI in a plasmid designated pMark S  Because  in this study  we targeted the possible exchange of genes between viral genomes  all markers a  b  c  and d were introduced within coding regions corresponding to open reading frames I  IV  V  and VI  respectively 
Another important concern was to quantify recombination in the absence of selection  i e  to create neutral markers 
Consequently all markers consist of synonymous mutations  see below To generate the parental virus particles  plasmids pCa  and pMark S were mechanically inoculated into individual plants as previously described   
All plants were turnips  B  rapa cv   Just Right  grown under glasshouse conditions at   °C with a    light dark  photoperiod 
Thirty days post inoculation  all symptomatic leaves were harvested and viral particles were purified as described earlier   The resulting preparations of parental viruses  designated Cabb S and Mark S  were quantified by spectrometry using the formula described by Hull et al 
  
We fixed the initial frequency of markers to a value of   and a solution containing   mg ml of virus particles of both Cabb S and Mark S at a   ratio was prepared 
Plantlets were co infected by mechanical inoculation of two to three leaves with   μl of this virus solution  using abrasive Celite AFA  Fluka  Ronkonkoma  New York  United States 
The mixed CaMV population was allowed to grow during   d of systemic infection We designed an experimental protocol for quantifying marker frequency within a mixed Cabb S Mark S virus population after a single passage in a host plant 
Twenty four individual plants  inoculated as above with equal amounts of Cabb S and Mark S  were harvested   d post inoculation  when symptoms were fully developed 
The viral DNA was purified from   mg of young newly formed infected leaves according to the protocol described previously   
After the precipitation step of this protocol  the viral DNA was resuspended and further purified with the Wizard DNA clean up kit  Promega  Fitchburg  Wisconsin  United States  in TE  X   mM Tris HCl and   mM EDTA  pH   
Aliquots of viral DNA preparations were digested by restriction enzymes corresponding either to marker a  b  c  or d and submitted to a   agarose gel electrophoresis  colored by ethydium bromide and exposed to UV 
Each individual restriction enzyme cut once in Cabb S DNA and twice in Mark S  thus generating DNA fragments of different sizes attributable to one or the other in the mixed population of CaMV genomes 
After scanning the agarose gels  we estimated the relative frequency of the two genotypes in each viral DNA preparation and at each marker position  by densitometry using the NIH   Image program 
The statistical analyses of the frequency of the four markers are described below To identify and quantify the recombinants within the CaMV mixed populations  aliquots from ten of the   viral DNA preparations described above were digested by the restriction enzyme SalI  and directly cloned into pUC  at the corresponding site 
In each of the ten viral populations analyzed    full genome length clones were digested separately by BsiWI  PstI  MluI  and SacI  to test for the presence of marker a  b  c  and d  respectively 
In this experiment  with the marker representing an additional restriction site  we could easily distinguish between the Cabb S and the Mark S genotype at all four marker positions  upon agarose gel   electrophoresis of the digested clones 
Clones with none or all four markers were parental genotypes  whereas clones harboring     or   markers were clearly recombinants 
Due to the very high number of recombinants detected  markers eventually appearing or disappearing due to spontaneous mutations were neglected Here we present the different methods we used to quantify recombination in the CaMV genome 
Because all these methods assume that the different markers are neutral  we first discuss assumption We used two datasets to test the neutrality of markers  both resulting from plants co infected with a   ratio of Mark S and Cabb S 
The first consisted of viral DNA densitometry data derived from   plants  described above  where for each plant we have an estimate of the frequency of each marker in the genome population 
The second consisted of the restriction of   individual full genome length viral clones obtained from one co infected plant  described above  yielding an estimate of the frequency of each marker  and this was repeated on ten different plants 
The frequencies of the different markers were       and   for markers a  b  c  and d in the first dataset and       and   in the second dataset 
We tested whether these frequencies were significantly different from the expected value under neutrality    using either t tests  for datasets where normality could not be rejected  seven out of eight cases  or Wilcoxon signed rank non parametric tests otherwise  marker c in the first dataset 
In all cases p values were larger than  There are several cautionary remarks regarding these analyses 
First  in all cases we found an excess of markers 
Unfortunately  the two datasets cannot be regarded as independent because  even though the methods through which the frequency estimates were obtained were different  the plants used in the second dataset were a subset of the plants of the first 
We thus have only four independent estimates in each case  and there is minimal power to detect significant deviations from neutrality with such a small sample size 
It should be noted at this stage that deviations from the expected value could also be caused either by slight deviations from the   ratio in the infecting mixed solution  or by deviations from that ratio in the frequency of the viral particles that actually get into the plants 
Second  because of the relatively small sample sizes and low statistical power  the tests presented above could have detected only large deviations The results clearly show  however  precisely that the markers do not have large effects  if any  and that therefore recombination estimates would be affected only very slightly by any hypothetical selective effects of the markers 
Because of this  along with the fact that the introduced markers provoke silent substitutions in the CaMV genome  we assumed that markers were effectively neutral in the rest of the analysis The dataset used to estimate the recombination frequency consisted of the   full genome length viral clones   from each of ten co infected plants  individually genotyped for each of the four markers 
As discussed in detail in the Results  recombination was very frequent and concerned all four markers 
Indeed  approximately half of the genotyped clones exhibited a recombinant genotype 
It was therefore meaningful to try to obtain quantitative estimates of recombination from our data Our aim was to analyze viral recombination in a live host 
Consequently  we had to deal with the fact that more than one viral replication cycle occurred during the   d that infection lasted in our experiment  we had to wait that long for the disease to develop and to be able to recover sufficient amounts of viral DNA from each infection 
Based on the kinetics of gene expression    we postulate that each replication cycle lasts between   and   d  and that therefore seven to ten cycles occurred between infection and the sampling time 
In case this assumption is incorrect  we did calculations assuming five  seven  ten  or   replication cycles during these   d  As shown  the results were not affected qualitatively  and only slightly quantitatively 
It is important to note that we assumed that recombination occurred through a template switching mechanism  and that therefore  from a recombination point of view  the CaMV genome is linear 
The reverse transcription starts and finishes at the position   in Figure   which is the point of circularization of the DNA genome 
This implies that changes between contiguous markers a–b  b–c  and c–d can be considered as true recombination whereas those between a and d cannot  as they may simply stem from circularization of DNA  during the synthesis of which the polymerase has switched template once anywhere between a–b  b–c  or c–d To estimate the recombination rate between markers  we wrote recurrence equations describing the change in frequency of each genotype over one generation  assuming random mating and no selection  i e  the standard Wright–Fisher population genetics model 
We then expressed the frequency of all possible genotypes n generations later as a function of their initial frequency and of the recombination parameters 
Subsequently we calculated the maximum likelihood estimates of the recombination parameters and their asymptotic variances given initial frequencies  we assumed that the two  parental  genotypes  Mark S and Cabb S  had equal initial frequencies of   and that all other genotypes had initial frequencies of zero  and frequencies after n generations  the observed frequencies  as stated above we used different values of n 
All algebraic and numerical calculations were carried out with the software Mathematica The recombination parameters are the recombination rates between two adjacent loci  e g  r
  for the recombination rate between markers a and b  and the interference coefficients  e g  i
  for interference between recombination events in the segments between markers a and b and b and c  To define these parameters we followed Christiansen    and in particular the recombination distributions for two  three  and four loci  respectively  Tables     and   of   
It is important to realize that given the definitions of these parameters  the estimator of the recombination rate between two loci is not affected by the number of loci considered 
In other words  we obtain the same estimation of the recombination rate between markers a and b whether we consider genotypic frequencies at just these two loci  or the frequencies at these two loci plus a third locus  or the complete information to which we have access  the four marker genotypes 
Information on additional loci only affects the estimates of the interference coefficients It proved impossible to carry out the calculations for four loci algebraically 
Instead  we used a computer program to calculate the expected genotypic frequencies at all four loci after n generations  given the above stated initial frequencies and specified recombination parameters 
For each combination of recombination parameters we calculated a Euclidean distance between the vector of the expected genotypic frequencies and the observed genotypic frequencies  and considered that the estimated recombination parameters were those yielding the minimal Euclidean distance 
In all cases  the estimated recombination rates between pairs of loci were equal to the second decimal to those estimated algebraically from data for three or two loci Tumor Restrictions to Oncolytic VirusIn most solid tumors the tumor interior displays a high cellular density with multiple cell types  both malignant and normal  stromal  cells  interdigitated by strands of extracellular matrix  ECM  and other poorly defined tissue 
Stromal cells typically consist of fibroblasts  macrophages  neutrophils and other immune cell types 
Tumor associated fibroblasts are a source of the bulk acellular tissue in tumors    which is largely made up of polysugars and glycoproteins  such as collagens  laminins  fibronectins  proteoglycans  hyaluronan and water  forming a dense matrix around and between the cancer cells   
This matrix provides structural support but also haptotactic and chemotactic guidance for cancer cells   
Moreover  the prevailing tumor interstitium is rich in soluble angiogenic factors  such as members of the vascular endothelial growth factor  VEGF  family    cellular growth factors  including endothelial growth factor  EGF  basic fibroblast growth factor  FGF  platelet derived growth factor  PDGF  and pleiotrophic factors  particularly transforming growth factor  TGF  beta   
Additionally  both tumor  and stromal cells secrete cytokines and chemokines  such as interleukin  IL    IL   tumor necrosis factor  TNF  alpha  stromal cell derived factor  SDF    macrophage migration inhibitory factor  MIF    which on one hand recruit more stromal and progenitor cells into the tumors and on the other hand curb the activity of antigen presenting cells and anti tumor T cells   
In several independent cancer types  high serum levels of IL   and IL   are indicators of poor prognosis   Aberrant tumor and stromal growth combined with an overproduction of matrix leads to high interstitial pressure in the tumor  preventing lateral diffusion of therapeutic compounds within the tumor 
Tight cellular compactness combined with a high tumor proliferation rate also causes physical crowding and puts constraints on oxygenation  which due to aberrant angiogenesis and rupture of the haphazard vessels is mostly incomplete and results in chronic tissue hypoxia toward the tumor cores 
As cancer cells exist in a crowding hypoxic  and cytokine growth factor perpetuated chronic state of stress  they upregulate a number of key cellular molecules that function as a collective defense against a wide range of therapies  including oncolytic viruses 
The properties of oncolytic viruses and their status in clinical development as well as various delivery options have been reviewed elsewhere   
In this review  we provide an overview of two of the main intratumoral barriers to oncolytic virus spread  the extracellular tumor make up and the intracellular antiviral defense mechanisms Tumor cellular structure and composition may in concert with abundant extracellular matrix  ECM  deposition pose a severe hurdle for systemic virus entry and propagation of infection within the tumor 
The extracellular matrix is a complex dense network consisting of multiple proteins  glycoproteins and polysaccharides including collagens  laminins  fibronectins  proteoglycans and hyaluronic acid   
The interstitial fluid pressure  IFP  in the tumor surrounding blood and lymphatic vessels is mainly created by the high cell density that forms an increased physical pressure outwards and does not allow free diffusion of therapeutics   
A high IFP generally predicts an aggressive tumor phenotype as tumor cells tend to escape from tumor margins where the pressure drops  thus facilitating spread of metastatic cells   
On the other hand  for therapeutic virus  interstitial fluid concentration gradients may pose a hurdle as passive diffusion in viable regions  typically the rim  may occur mainly outward   
Given the limited arsenal of known chemicals alleviating tumor compactness and the poor penetration drugs in general into the tumor tissue  this is a considerable problem that may not be easy to tackle 
Some strategies are discussed below Viruses are passive particles and rely either on radial cell to cell spread or on soluble diffusion across concentration gradients to reach their target cells and to propagate the infection 
Tumor matrix is critical in this regard  as it can block both forms of spread 
Passively diffusing viruses may physically not fit through the strands of the ECM 
This was shown for oncolytic herpes virus  which has an outer diameter of over   nm  and whose spreading could be improved by matrix degrading bacterial collagenase co injection   
Bilbao and coworkers showed that adenovirus entry into experimental hepatocellular carcinoma nodules in the livers of immunocompetent rats following intravenous or intraportal injection was directly related to the thickness of the ECM capsule enveloping the nodules   
On the other hand  we found using Semliki Forest virus  which has an outer diameter of about   nm  that even upon intratumoral injection spread was blocked by ECM  which formed a physical barrier for virus infection  Figure  The foremost option to reduce interstitial fluid pressure and to remove physical molecule barriers imposed by the ECM is to use matrix degrading enzymes 
These act by digesting collagen  fibrin  and other types of fibrillar matrix deposits  creating more space between cell clusters  and glycosaminoglycan polymers  known to limit fluid movement in tumors 
Simultaneously  such strategies may also expose more cell surface to viruses  increasing the likelihood of infection 
In a study by Kuriyama  trypsin or collagenase dispase was injected into subcutaneous U  and U  glioma xenografts in immunocompromised mice  followed by a reporter adenovirus   
Both types of ECM degrading enzymes increased tumor transduction by the virus  but when doses got too high  transduction efficacy suffered  demonstrating a balance between ECM degradation and oncolytic virus efficacy 
In another study  treatment of PC  tumors with vaccinia virus producing matrix metalloprotease  MMP    resulted in reduction of collagen IV fibrils and increase in virus penetration into tumor  which yielded elevated virus titers   
Hong et al 
targeted orthotopic neuroblastoma xenografts engineered to express MMP  with oncolytic HSV  achieving increased virus distribution compared to control tumors   
Similar results were obtained when human soft tissue sarcoma HSTS T overexpressing MMP  or MMP  were injected with oncolytic HSV   
MMP expressing tumors contained significantly less sulfated glycosaminoglycans compared to control tumors 
Other enzymes and protein effectors  either engineered into virus expression cassettes or provided exogenously  include hyaluronidase  decorin  various other MMPs  and notably relaxin a peptide hormone normally expressed during particular phase of pregnancy that does not possess tissue degrading activity itself  but instead induces a number of key collagen degrading proteases seemingly in a tumor specific manner   
Beyer showed that relaxin expressed by murine stem cells improved trastuzumab penetrance and therapy outcome in syngeneic tumor models   
In another study  chimeric adenovirus Ad  expressing relaxin showed increased tumor transduction and virus dissemination   Several other strategies to increase penetration of therapeutics in tumors have been developed   
While the stromal ECM capsule of tumor nodules acts as a physical barrier to virus entry following intravenous injection  it was possible to improve tumor infection by administering vaso active compounds  angiotensin II  histamine  nitroglycerine  before the virus   
This is interesting  as vasculature per se would not be expected to alter or influence the physical composition of the ECM  such as collagen strand thickness 
Instead  virus access to the tumor was improved  most likely by increased access from the blood via tumor stromal adjoining vessels 
Interestingly  in a study with oncolytic herpes virus  anti VEGF monoclonal antibody Bevacizumab given before intravenous virus injection gave poorer anti tumor efficacy than when given after the virus   
The study showed that while HSV is able to enter and infect tumors better through their leaky vasculature compared to Bevacizumab normalized vasculature  vascular normalization by Bevacizumab still gave superior combination efficacy when the virus was already in the tumor 
This effect was likely dependent on altering both physical and biological properties of the tumor  including interstitial pressure and oxygenation 
In another study  anti VEGF A antibody injections in nude mice harboring U  human glioma xenografts led to an increase in MMP  expression and reduction in collagen fiber content  facilitating improved distribution of oncolytic adenovirus within the tumor tissue   
In general  targeting tumor vasculature by oncolytic viruses and including agents that affect tumor vasculature in combination regimens is gaining interest    and it will be interesting to see more specific studies on how vascular acting agents may affect the physical barriers to oncolytic viruses Some viruses do not need an extracellular step for propagating infection  such as members of the herpes and poxvirus families  and may be able to spread from cell to cell 
For example  HSV  is able to infect neighboring cells via lateral tight junctions in a manner dependent on its glycoproteins E and I   
Vaccinia virus  on the other hand  induces so called actin tails  which are actin filament driven membranous protrusions of the plasma membrane harboring a single virus particle at the outer tip 
These actin tails actively deliver and deposit virus particles onto or even into neighboring cells   
Because lateral spread without an extracellular step may circumvent neutralizing immunity as well as some of the physical obstacles the tumor microenvironment imposes  this ability has been engineered into viruses that normally do not possess it 
A promising strategy is to engineer OVs to express membrane fusogenic genes  MFGs  such as gibbon ape leukemia virus  GALV  glycoprotein  reptilian reovirus p  protein  FAST  or the membrane glycoproteins H and F of measles virus   
Quite intriguingly  expression of several different MFGs by oncolytic adenovirus synergized with chemotherapy in anti tumor efficacy both in vitro and in vivo    suggesting that membrane fusion facilitated lateral spread of also chemotherapeutics  which otherwise would not have occurred in a compact tumor 
The potential limitation of cell to cell dependent spread  however  may be that membrane free physical barriers  such as the ECM  may still pose a barrier to spread 
Also  it is unclear whether MFGs or other mechanisms of lateral spread may assist in reaching distant tumor nests Some other strategies to alleviate matrix imposed restrictions to oncolytic viruses have been discussed elsewhere   Tumors of epithelial origin mostly retain the firm cellular integrity seen in their original adhesive intercellular configuration 
Several viruses use cellular receptors which are located in paracellular tight junctions  which may be problematic in tightly packed tumors   
Adenovirus C group viruses use coxsackie adenovirus receptor  CAR  as their primary entry point  whereas adenovirus B  group members and measles virus Edmonston use CD  complement binding molecule as their cellular receptor   
Adenovirus B  group  serotypes       and   entry occurs using desmoglein   DSG    
Of these  CAR and DSG  are preferentially located within tight junctions and are hidden from virus binding   
Also the complement receptor CD  was ascribed a role in maintenance of epithelial cell integrity by interactions with the E cadherin catenin network   
These observations imply that before reaching the potential entry site on the tumor cell the virus must find its way into the junctional space 
Moreover  it has become increasingly clear that for example glioma tumors traditionally targeted by Ad  serotype adenoviruses often express only low levels of CAR and instead much higher levels of CD    Beyond that tight junctions hide multiple virus receptors  they contain a network of adhesion molecules  including ZO  cadherins  claudins and occludin  which  if perturbed  is associated with more aggressive disease in many types of cancer   
Since tight junctions also contain important receptors that mediate tumor promoting signaling and which have been targeted by monoclonal antibodies  notably Her  it would be highly useful to develop strategies that temporarily loosen the tight junction contacts even at cost of a transient increase in tumor metastatic risk 
One of the most interesting approaches has been to exploit the natural propensity of adenovirus serotype   which as part of its natural life cycle creates dodecahedral particles  PtDd  consisting of viral capsid proteins  penton base and fiber that open tight junctions by binding to and dissolving desmoglein  dimers and reducing E cadherin expression  to develop a specific tight junction opening molecule  JO    
Adenovirus type   uses PtDds to promote its own infection  opening the tight junctions ahead of infection to maximize access to desmoglein 
Analogously  when administered to human tumor xenografts  JO  facilitated penetration of trastuzumab much deeper into the tumor tissue than when the monoclonal antibody was administered on its own   
Moreover  JO  synergized with several chemotherapeutics in solid tumor models   
Backed by our own findings with oncolytic SFV  showing that both extracellular matrix and tumor cell compactness restrict virus spread and oncolytic efficacy  we believe combination approaches that target both tight junctions and extracellular matrix will prove effective in future virotherapy development  Figure  An alternative approach to increasing tumor penetration by oncolytic viruses is to alter tumor cell morphology and status 
Notably  cell death and in particular the type of cell death induced by virus has been shown to affect virus distribution within a tumor mass  in a study by Nagano et al  administration of apoptosis inducing paclitaxel before injecting oncolytic herpes simplex virus increased virus dissemination in the tumor  allowing its diffuse in  tunnels  created by shrinking dying tumor cells   Maintenance of physiological adherence is essential for proper ECM function and for retaining cellular integrity 
Therefore  a potential caveat of using ECM degrading proteolytic enzymes or tight junction openers is the risk of neoplastic cell detachment from the tumor ECM and increased risk of metastasis 
While ECM degradation or tight junction opening may operate innocuously  there is also a chance that loss of E cadherins via proteases or via non specific deregulation of tight junction integrity during ECM modulating therapy could trigger pro tumorigenic Wnt β catenin signaling  possibly driving epithelial to mesenchymal transition   
One study showed that ectopic relaxin expression stimulated MMP expression and enhanced breast cancer invasiveness    whereas another paper found short term relaxin exposure to increase breast cancer cell motility whereas long term expression reduced both motility and cancer invasiveness   
In the context of oncolytic viruses  Lavilla Alonso tested several proteases  including hyaluronidase  relaxin  and macrophage metalloelastase  and showed they all could assist adenovirus entry into tumors  yet  the authors did not detect treatment induced metastases or increase in tumor invasiveness   
Another strategy possibly balancing some of the putative risks of tight junction disruption could be to use Wnt dependent oncolytic viruses   Tumors are invariably fenestrated by host fibroblasts  myeloid cells and other non transformed cells  which driven by cancer induced cues can adopt various reprogrammed phenotypes to promote tumor angiogenesis and growth and to alter tumor responses to therapies   
As most of them normally play a role in immune homeostasis and pathogen sensing  they also respond to and influence oncolytic virus infection of tumors Fulci et al 
reported that injection of oncolytic HSV  directly into glioblastoma tumor parenchyma triggered upregulation of CD  and CD  monocytic markers and rapid clearance of virus  likely executed by infiltrating phagocytic cells   
When clodronate liposomes were used to deplete macrophages in vivo  the authors observed a  fold increase in virus titers in the brain tumors concomitant with an   reduction in peripheral CD  macrophages in animal spleens  suggesting that CD  cells migrate into the tumors upon virus injection and limit overall oncolytic efficacy 
While CD  cells were not reduced by peripheral macrophage depletion  arguing that these cells had been recruited to the tumors before the treatment  they could be eliminated in live glioma slices ex vivo  resulting in a  fold increase in virus replication 
Macrophages may secrete antiviral type I interferon constitutively at very low  subnanomolar  levels   and recently Liu et al 
showed that tumor resident CD  macrophages induced a protective antiviral state in ovarian and breast tumors which led to resistance to oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus  VSV  infection   
Type I IFN signaling  JAK  inhibitor Ruxolitinib reversed the resistance  facilitating VSV replication in the macrophage protected cancer cells 
It is tempting to speculate that tumor resident macrophages also rendered syngeneic GL  and DBT mouse gliomas completely refractory to VA  oncolytic alphavirus  as these cells were quite infectable in vitro and live glioma slices regained their sensitivity to virus within   h  indicating dilution of IFN I   Macrophages or the closely related myeloid suppressor cells are the predominant stromal cell type in many tumors and are actively recruited during cancer progression   
Heavy macrophage presence in the tumors indicates that such tumors may be resistant to oncolytic virotherapy  unless depleting preconditioning would be used 
Moreover  as part of the early immune response to virus infection  monocytic cells are rapidly recruited to tumors following intratumoral virus injection 
In one study  depletion of either CD b  cells or VEGF secreted by these cells in mice treated with oncolytic HSV  greatly increased oncolytic efficacy  tentatively linking pro tumorigenic and antiviral angiogenic mechanisms   Another key pro tumorigenic signaling employed by many tumors is up regulation of CXCR  the receptor for chemokine CXCL   also known as SDF  and recruitment of stromal cells expressing CXCL  which maintain the tumor and recruit additional cells to support tumor expansion and invasion  such as endothelial cell progenitors which contribute to neovascularization   
Indeed  high CXCR  expression is a negative prognostic factor for many cancers 
Oncolytic vaccinia virus engineered to express a soluble antagonist of CXCR  showed improved intratumoral virus replication  increased vascular disruption and a markedly reduced infiltration of the tumors by putative immune suppressive and tumor promoting stromal cells   
This study highlights how reducing pro tumor stromal cell effects may alleviate antiviral resistance and yield increased overall therapeutic efficacy 
On the other hand  if the paracrine antiviral effects of tumor homing monocytic cells could be selectively abrogated these cells could favorably be used to ferry oncolytic viruses into tumors 
Indeed  a significant delay in metastatic tumor potential was achieved when macrophages were harnessed to deliver a tumor specific oncolytic adenovirus   What is the antiviral status in human cancer 
Recent analyses from different normal cells that occupy the same organ reveal striking functional variation in components of the type I IFN signaling pathway that correlate with the tissue tropism and virulence of some virus strains   
Can similar variation in such components be found in cancer cells  or do cancer cells make an exception Transformed cells undergo selective elimination by the immune system before becoming cancerous  termed immunoediting  based on observations of differential capacity of immunocompetent mice to reject tumors previously grown in immunocompromised hosts versus syngeneic animals   
Cancer cell responsiveness to type I and type II IFNs plays a role during immunoediting  cancer cells that eventually progress to form a tumor display reduced capacity to respond to IFN gamma  which otherwise would upregulate MHC class I molecules and render the tumors amenable to CD  T cell mediated destruction  whereas responsiveness to type I interferon initially helps tumors avoid immune purging during the editing phase and is then irrelevant   
Of note  the anti tumor effects of type I IFN  still exploited today in several cancers  were shown to depend on host NK cells  and mice in which IFNAR was blocked by monoclonal antibody failed to reject even highly immunogenic tumors  as opposed to mice treated with control antibody  who all rejected the immunogenic tumor challenge   
Thus  whereas tumor responsiveness to type I IFN is not predetermined after immunoediting  other factors post immunoediting may influence it In several tumor types  varying levels of expression of components of the type I IFN signaling cascade have been detected  and in some tumor types these components have been found to have prognostic value  whereas in others they do not seem to influence survival   
However  emerging data suggests that antiviral genes may predict poor survival because they increase treatment resistance 
In one study  poor prognosis of several types of cancer due to genotoxic treatment resistance was found to correlate with increased activity of IFN I pathway genes   
In this study  a triad of type I IFN signaling pathway genes  STAT  ISG  and IFIT  formed a pan tumor type negative prognostic factor  and a broader seven gene cluster established negative prognostic criteria for treatment resistant breast cancer 
Treatment resistance was subsequently shown to depend on STAT  signaling  STAT expressing tumor clones were positively selected in animals in vivo  demonstrating increased proliferation and metastatic potential  and STAT expression mediated resistance against genotoxic assault by doxorubicin or ionizing radiation  knockdown of STAT  resulted in lower proliferation rate and metastatic capacity and increased sensitivity to genotoxic stress    
In another study  resistance to epigenetic DNA modifiers  AZA dC  a methyltransferase inhibitor  and LBH  or MGCD  both histone deacetylase  HDAC  inhibitors  was correlated with increased expression of IFN I pathway genes in small lung cancer cells   
Basal IFN related gene expression in several different SML cell lines was upregulated Interestingly  in many cancers  STAT proteins are not phosphorylated and persist in unphosphorylated form  U STAT 
Like its phosphorylated counterpart  U STAT  increases expression of genes contributing to resistance to DNA damaging agents   
While it is currently unknown why cancers may prefer to use unphosphorylated forms  it is known that U STATs activate distinct signals compared to their phosphorylated counterparts 
However  importantly for oncolytic viruses  in many tumors  constant expression and release of type I IFN leads to a constitutively high level of unphosphorylated forms of STAT  STAT  and IRF  which together form an unphosphorylated but functional ISGF like complex that relocalizes to the nucleus and drives expression of a specific set of ISGs distinct from acute IFN I exposure   
These ISGs are sufficient to maintain a functional antiviral defense and they play a critical role in resistance to DNA damaging agents On a cellular level  virus replication is controlled by antiviral defense molecules    which in turn are primarily controlled by type I IFN signaling 
In addition to classical type I IFN  or cytokine induced antiviral signaling  tumors may employ other antiviral defense mechanisms 
For example  stromal cells may secrete peptides with antiviral properties called defensins   
The defensins are amphiphatic and typically  –  amino acids in length and interfere with viruses by physically binding to and disrupting virus particles and or by inducing antiviral responses in target cells via pattern recognition receptors 
At least oral squamous cell carcinomas were found to overexpress defensins compared to normal control tissues   
While the role of defensins in oncolytic virus infection of tumors is unclear  one study showed that the immune stimulating properties of defensins may be exploited to increase overall therapeutic efficacy 
In this study  expression of beta   defensin from a conditionally replicating adenovirus yielded a superior therapeutic entity compared to the unarmed parental virus via enhanced anti tumor immune responses mediated by TLR dependent activation of dendritic cells   In summary  human cancers display varying degrees of expression of antiviral proteins or their signaling regulators at baseline 
Some of these may increase in response to genotoxic anti cancer treatments 
In the next chapter we will highlight some of the consequences to oncolytic virotherapy of the heterogeneity in type I IFN responsiveness in tumor cells All oncolytic viruses tested to date display variable infectivity in different cancer cell lines 
This variability is likely at least partly dependent on type I IFN as most oncolytic viruses are IFN sensitive 
IFN secretion follows virus sensing by the cells via Toll like receptors expressed on both the plasma membrane and in endocytotic vesicles  NOD like receptors  STING  AIM  NLP inflammosome and other danger sensing molecules  summarized elsewhere   
While all viruses carry an arsenal of counteracting molecules    no virus goes completely undetected 
Even HSV amplicons  which are devoid of functional virus genes  induce a type I IFN response that mediates a STAT dependent system wide antiviral defense in mice within one hour of intravenous vector injection  resulting in significant reduction of transgene expression compared to expression in STAT  knockout animals   During our own studies with attenuated SFV vector VA  it became apparent that the dramatic and lasting therapeutic efficacy achieved following mere single intravenous  or intratumoral  injection of the virus in immunocompromised mice bearing human A  melanoma or U  glioma xenografts   was not going to be recapitulated easily in immunocompetent animals   
The paradox in our studies was that while oncolytic SFV vector VA  effectively replicated in and destroyed a variety of IFN responsive cancer cell lines in vitro  it consistently failed to eradicate tumors generated from the same cell types in vivo  even if large doses of virus were injected directly into the tumor mass and even if the tumors were void of visible physical barriers  Figure  
Conversely  only tumors generated from IFN unresponsive cancer cells have seemed infectable in vivo by VA  so far 
In light of earlier findings by others  showing that type I IFN receptor knockout mice are highly susceptible to SFV infection and quickly succumb to multi organ systemic infection    the parameters for oncolytic SFV efficacy seem clear  tumor cells must be defective in type I IFN response for the virus to be effective These findings are in line with emerging data from other groups  showing a remarkably strict dependence of oncolytic virus replication on defective type I IFN responsiveness  a dogma introduced at the turn of the  st century   
For example  sarcomas and melanomas display differing permissiveness to oncolytic VSV  an obstacle which may be overcome by blocking type I IFN signaling   
In eight sarcoma cell lines  basal up regulation of RIG I and IFIT  and rapid induction of STAT  phosphorylation upon IFN I treatment correlated with resistance to oncolytic measles virus   
In other studies  human pancreatic and ovarian cancer cells display resistance against Rb dependent oncolytic adenovirus  strongly correlating with intracellular levels of MxA  and acquired resistance to repeated oncolytic adenovirus injections in an intraperitoneal ovarian carcinoma model was associated with an increase in MxA as well as several other key ISGs in the tumors   
A study comparing normal human or mouse melanocytes to a panel of melanoma cells revealed strong correlation between permissiveness to oncolytic VSV and capacity to mount antiviral defense in response to type I IFN   
In this study  VSV rp  harboring two mutations in P and L genes  was superior to several other tested oncolytic VSV strains  but the dependence on defective IFN responsiveness was still retained 
In yet another study  oncolytic VSV replicated in four out of twelve mesothelioma cell lines which were unable to mount antiviral defense upon IFN beta pretreatment or to respond to infection by up regulation of PKR  MxA or  OAS mRNA   
In contrast  the non permissive mesothelioma cells mounted antiviral defense  associated with PKR  MxA or  OAS mRNA up regulation  in response to infection or to exogenous type I IFN 
The authors of this study further linked the observed pattern of virus resistance to clinical mesothelioma samples  where in a mesothelioma tissue array  significant variance in immunoreactivity against PKR  p  and or IFNAR was observed  with only a few samples displaying lack of reactivity against all three components  arguing that most tumors in clinical settings would display at least some level of resistance to oncolytic VSV Oncolytic adenoviruses are often deleted for E A  which normally binds Rb and prevents it from sequestering E F  which results in the viruses being unable to replicate in normal cells 
However  since adenovirus  as with all viruses  contains elements that antagonize antiviral defenses  such elements have also been targets for deletion to render the virus sensitive to innate antiviral defenses  which would be expected to remain intact only in normal cells 
Cancer cells expressing Ras may down regulate protein kinase R and inhibit type I IFN induction by interfering with RIG I signaling   
Also  select interferon stimulated genes appear to be repressed by the Ras MEK ERK signaling cascade   
PKR activation shuts down E F dependent translation  including translation of virus messenger RNAs 
Therefore  an adenovirus deleted for VA RNA  which antagonizes PKR  should be capable of replicating in Ras overexpressing  tumor  cells 
However  while this was seemingly the case    it was later discovered that Ras is not an obligatory determinant for PKR inactivation and that virus replication was halted even in Ras overexpressing cells via functional PKR mediated E F phosphorylation  implying that the parameters of VA RNA deleted adenovirus replication had to be revised   
Similar findings were obtained with oncolytic reovirus  against which Ras independent tumor resistance emerged in vivo   
Thus  under some circumstances even tumor cells over expressing Ras may respond to type I IFN or to stimulants of pattern recognition receptors  activating PKR and inhibiting virus translation 
To complicate matters  MEK inhibitors have been shown restore antiviral signaling capacity in Ras overexpressing tumors   
This implies that human tumors treated with MEK inhibitors  such as Trametinib which was recently approved for treatment of BRAF mutated melanoma  may be poor targets for oncolytic viruses as antiviral signaling capacity in such tumors may be restored Some oncolytic viruses  such as members of the poxvirus family  are seemingly resistant to the antiviral effects of type I IFNs in vitro and may be controlled by other cellular factors   
However  in most cases  sensitivity or resistance to type I IFN is assessed in vitro and using only one cytokine  which may mask synergies with other factors present in vivo 
One possible explanation for the in vitro–in vivo discrepancy is the tumor micro environment  which not only imposes physical barriers to oncolytic viruses but also alters intracellular antiviral defenses 
For example  glioma cells were found in the brain to spontaneously secrete type I IFN  which conferred resistance against oncolytic HSV 
Resistance was linked to ECM protein CCN  interaction with glioma cell surface receptor alpha   beta   integrin  which activated interferon secretion   
It is tempting to speculate whether this or a similar ECM glioma interaction could have contributed to the resistance of syngeneic glioma cells we observed in vivo but not in vitro to both oncolytic SFV and vaccinia virus  FIG    
Also  while critical in many respects  antiviral signaling may occur without signaling via type I IFN receptor  IFNAR 
For instance  upon infection of IFNAR KO mice with murine hepatitis virus  MHV  brain cells were found to have upregulated antiviral GTPase TGTP and IFITm  and IFITm  all of which have confirmed antiviral activity in vivo against a variety of viruses   
In these cases  IFN gamma and TNF alpha likely account for at least part of the observed ISG activity  where e g  TGTP is upregulated by IFN γ signaling and TNFα has been shown to induce ISG  independently of IFNAR   Interestingly  while most cancers are heterogeneous in antiviral defence signaling  one broad class of tumors in particular may display consistently low capacity to ward off oncolytic viruses  oncovirus induced cancers 
This is because oncoviruses  as all viruses  carry a complement of factors that abrogate antiviral sensors and effectors  which may result in tumors that are uniformly devoid of antiviral signaling 
In an intriguing study  oncolytic VSV infected and destroyed human papilloma virus  HPV positive cervical carcinoma cells more effectively than HPV negative head  and neck cancer cells due to HPV E mediated suppression of antiviral signaling   
HPV positive or E expressing xenografts were efficiently eradicated from nude mice following VSV injection 
The potential of this approach is that even oncolytic viruses that are extremely sensitive to type I IFN  such as attenuated SFV or M mutated VSV  may function well against oncovirus induced cancers where the oncovirus machinery ensures the lack of antiviral defense While on first thought it would appear counterintuitive to antagonize the very factors that keep oncolytic viruses tumor specific  emerging data shows that this can be accomplished in a safe way 
One of the foremost strategies to increase oncolytic virus efficacy is to combine them with drugs that lower tumor antiviral defenses 
In this regard  a primary target for interference is the prototypical type I IFN signaling cascade 
While small molecular inhibitors against IFNAR are not available  activity of downstream signaling transducers may effectively be blocked 
Human pancreatic cancer cells were shown to constitutively express high levels of MxA and OAS and to mount type I IFN dependent resistance to oncolytic VSV 
Resistance could be overcome by blocking activity of IFNAR associated Janus kinase  JAK      
Similarly  JAK  inhibitor ruxolitinib overcame type I IFN dependent resistance of human SCC  head and neck cancer cells against oncolytic VSV   
Ruxolitinib also successfully abrogated type I IFN mediated antiviral effects elicited by macrophages    highlighting that this drug might also alleviate type I IFN dependent tumor resistance to oncolytic viruses imposed by stromal cells 
However  the obvious downside to using JAK inhibitors is their effects on critical host defense mechanisms  which may result in increased infection of normal cells 
Moreover  JAK inhibitors may reduce anti tumor immune responses elicited by oncolytic virotherapy 
For example  ruxolitinib was shown to impair the capacity of dendritic cells promote CD  T cell responses against model tumor antigens   
On the other hand  in this study clearance of adenovirus was delayed in ruxolitinib treated normal animals  which makes it difficult to predict the overall impact of JAK inhibitors on tumor therapy where prolonged virus presence might translate to better therapeutic efficacy 
Also  while the immune stimulating and anti tumor effects of type I and type II interferons may be adversely affected by JAK inhibitors  central tumor promoting cascades mediated by JAKs  such as IL STAT  may also be inhibited    yielding a difficult to predict net therapeutic outcome 
At the moment  more studies are needed to establish the overall impact of interference with JAK  signaling in cancer therapy Spurred by earlier reports of oncovirus reactivation and promoter enhancement by histone deacetylase  HDAC  inhibitors  this class of agents was assessed for capacity to enhance oncolytic virus potency by inhibiting antiviral responses 
Indeed  such enhancement was observed with oncolytic VSV and SFV  and while it has been difficult to pinpoint the exact mechanisms that underlie HDAC inhibitor enhancement of oncolytic virus replication in cancer cells  antiviral defenses in general are inhibited for yet unknown reasons mainly in cancer cells and not in normal cells  which indirectly facilitates virus replication   
Interestingly  combination of HDAC inhibitors with conditionally replicating   E A deleted adenovirus gave improved virus replication rate and therapeutic efficacy in subcutaneous xenograft models only when the inhibitors were given before the virus  otherwise inhibition of replication was observed   
Similarly  HDAC inhibitors increased replication and oncolytic efficacy of HSV when given before the virus but not when given at the same time   
With nuclear DNA viruses  such as adenovirus and HSV  it is possible that HDAC inhibitors also alter virus genome accessibility to transcription factors  resulting in reduced replication or other adverse effects  implying that with these viruses HDAC inhibitors should be administered before the viruses Recently  it was found that HDAC inhibitor vorinostat activates NfκB signaling by facilitating hyperacetylation of the p  subunit  which in turn activates cellular autophagy   
Autophagy was in another study shown to be important for VSV replication  presumably by inhibiting antiviral signaling 
This is interesting  as a previous study revealed enhancement of VSV replication by inhibiting TNF alpha induced antiviral signaling mediated by p  using NfκB inhibitors BMS  or TPCA    
In this study  neither inhibitor had an effect on STAT  or STAT  phosphorylation or their nuclear relocalization in response to type I IFN but the authors observed clear induction of ISG  GBP  and MX  in response to type I IFN in U  glioma cells  with the latter two being dependent on NfκB signaling 
Taken together  NfκB pathway activation may result in different antiviral responses in different cancer types  and inhibition or enhancement of oncolytic viruses by NfκB inhibitors is dependent on other concomitant cellular mechanisms  such as autophagy Since HDAC inhibitors modulate promoter activity accessibility  it is conceivable other epigenetic or promoter modifying agents could work in a similar manner to repress antiviral defense induction and enhance oncolytic viruses   
DNA demethylating agents  azacytidine  Aza  and decitabine synergized with oncolytic herpes simplex type   virus in glioma models in vitro and in vivo  as did HDAC inhibitor valproic acid  VPA  which was already shown before to work well with oncolytic HSV as well as several other oncolytic viruses   
Moreover  inhibition of cancer antiviral defenses  specifically RNAseL and PKR  resulted when cancer cells were exposed to sunitinib  a multi tyrosine kinase inhibitor originally developed as an inhibitor of VEGF R and PDGF R signaling  yielding strong anti tumor synergy with IFN sensitive oncolytic VSV   
Since sunitinib is approved for renal cell carcinoma and imatinib resistant gastric cancers  combination with oncolytic VSV constitutes a promising and clinically relevant approach warranting further investigation 
Interstingly  sunitinib as well as several other receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors displayed antiviral effects against polyomavirus BK    arguing that these compounds are not universal virus enhancers Cyclophosphamide  CPA  is a general immunosuppressant used to minimize Treg presence during immunotherapy and also oncolytic virotherapy 
CPA may  however  also enhance replication and efficacy of oncolytic viruses by diminishing cytokine secretion by stromal cells  including type I IFN   
Another compound enhancing oncolytic virus efficacy by lowering cell responsiveness to type I IFN is triptolide  which acts downstream of IRF  activation   
Further  the kinase mammalian target of rapamycin  mTOR  enhances the antiviral effects of type I IFN by activation of its effector proteins  E BP  which binds and inactivates translation factor eIF E  and S K  which carries out cell type specific signaling functions of type I IFN  such as activation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor  B and promotion of ISG  transcription 
Consequently  rapamycin was able to enhance oncolytic VSV replication and anti tumor efficacy by inhibiting type I IFN mediated antiviral signaling via mTOR   Several other compounds synergizing with oncolytic viruses have been identified via high throughput drug library screening  many of which seem to act by antagonizing antiviral defenses 
For instance  a novel virus sensitizer  Vse  was found to greatly diminish antiviral effects of type I IFN against oncolytic VSV in several cancer cell types  and the drug also synergized with the virus in subcutaneous mouse tumor models   
For many of these new compounds  the mechanism of action is still poorly understood  necessitating extensive safety studies to exclude undesirable effects against normal cells Apart from classical type I IFN induced antiviral defenses  which typically prevent virus translation and degrade virus genomes  other cellular machineries regulate oncolytic virus efficacy 
Notably  strategies to increase cancer cell death in response to oncolytic viruses have been tested 
In a recent study  a class of compounds called SMAC mimetics synergized in several cancer models with oncolytic VSV by removing cancer cell block to apoptosis in response to virus induced type I IFN  TNF α or TRAIL   
Interestingly  since virus infection triggered cytokines act on nearby non infected cells  SMAC mimetics may in combination with oncolytic viruses also cause significant bystander tumor destruction 
Normal cells are not affected by the IFN SMAC mimetic synergy  providing an important safety aspect 
In another study  blocking the ER stress response circuitry triggered by oncolytic rhabdovirus infection by a small molecular inhibitor of serine threonine protein kinase and endoribonuclease IRE α  which was identified in a genome wide siRNA screen  greatly enhanced cytotoxicity via caspase induced apoptosis and increased oncolytic efficacy in refractory tumor models in mice   
This effect was independent on induction or responsiveness to type I IFN 
Conversely  inhibitors of nucleoside transporter   ENT  were discovered from a high throughput screen of enhancers of oncolytic HSV  and to date such inhibitors have not been reported to alter cellular antiviral responses   
Other compounds  such as common chemotherapeutics  and their mechanisms synergizing with oncolytic viruses have been discussed elsewhere for most of them the possible role of antiviral defense antagonism in enhancing oncolytic virus efficacy remains to be studied   Thus  many compounds are available to interfere with tumor antiviral defenses 
The outstanding question for most of them  however  seems to be why such compounds do not render normal cells sensitive to oncolytic viruses 
Elucidation of the exact mechanisms of action and the differences between normal and cancer cells constitute a worthy goal for studies in the near future Already in the  s it became clear that using certain pathogenic wildtype viruses  such as West Nile virus and Bunyamwera virus  in cancer patients would result in off target toxicity   
Characteristic for pathogenic viruses is a greater ability to circumvent or antagonize cellular innate antiviral defenses than attenuated strains 
For example  unlike the prototypical oncolytic reovirus strain type   Dearing  the T L strain of reovirus causes accumulation of IRF  in the nucleus and inhibits activation of a select group of ISGs yet because of this property the T L strain is myocarditic unlike the oncolytic type   Dearing strain   
For these reasons  many oncolytic viruses used today  such as reovirus type   Dearing  oncolytic strains of Newcastle disease virus and M mutated VSV have either a stronger capacity to induce or a weaker capacity to resist antiviral type I IFN than the corresponding wildtype strains   An open question  however  is whether strain specific or virus specific differences that relate to specific components of the cellular antiviral machinery may be exploited for greater anti tumor efficacy  i e  if one virus fails  could another be used in its stead 
While Ras expression was critical for oncolytic reovirus replication in cells overexpressing CUG  oncogene  oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus was unable to replicate in the same cells due to increased activation of STAT  and OASL    
Thus  in these cells reovirus was not affected by STAT  or OASL  and it therefore remains interesting to see which other antiviral effectors may have been lacking in the CUG expressing cells and  conversely  how reovirus and VSV differ in terms of sensitivity to antiviral effectors 
While several oncolytic viruses have been compared to each other in terms of replication rate and cytotoxicity  systematic studies with regard to tumor antiviral defenses have not been conducted As any attenuated virus is likely to replicate effectively only in its own niche  i e  to be restricted by a specific set of ISGs  and as wild type strains may be too toxic for use in humans  a compromise may be achieved by incorporating select elements from wild type viruses into oncolytic virus backbones 
Indeed  several chimeric and recombinant viruses have been generated that harbor specific elements of wild type strains or even of other unrelated viruses in order to better resist cancer antiviral defenses  Table  
As an example of introducing wild type elements into attenuated viruses  Haralambieva reported on a measles virus Edmonston vaccine strain in which P gene was replaced with the counterpart from the wild type IC B strain   
Later  Meng et al 
included N  P  and L genes from wild type measles in Edmonston backbone  producing an enhanced but still safe oncolytic virus   
Edmonston vaccine virus induces a more robust IFN response compared to wild type measles virus partly due to the weaker ability of V protein to suppress MDA mediated activation of IRF  and IFN I induction   
In vivo  P gene encoded proteins  particularly V  control the quality of the cytokine response to measles so that vaccine strains qualitatively induce a stronger inflammatory response compared to WT strains  where WT V protein suppresses multiple cytokine secretion 
V protein short cytoplasmic tail has been shown to bind and inactivate STAT  IRF  MDA  and the Rel homology domain of the NfκB subunit p  but not of p    
Also  V causes LGP  protein to bind and inactivate RIG I    but it seemingly does not interfere with TICAM   TRIF  multiple TLR adaptor  including TLR mediated IFN β induction 
Thus  if cancer and normal cells would differ with regard to TICAM  or IRF  then such a virus could potentially target specifically cancer cells rather than normal cells 
So far  the measles Edmonston WT chimeras have proven safe in animals As an example of heterologous virus constructs  lentogenic Newcastle disease virus engineered to express influenza virus PR   H N  NS  showed enhanced oncolytic efficacy in vivo due to dampening of antiviral responses   
While such a virus did not display enhanced pathogenicity in that study  a mesogenic NDV virus harboring NS  from influenza strain H N  did show increased pathogenicity in chickens as well as an increased ability to replicate in human cells    raising some cautionary warnings for future engineering of similar replicative viruses 
As another example  vaccinia virus soluble type I IFN scavenger B R  NOTE  B R is often used in the literature  has been engineered into both oncolytic HSV and oncolytic rhabdoviruses  resulting in all cases in more effective therapy agents without loss of tumor specificity   
Oncolytic γ  gene deleted HSV was complemented by two different PKR antagonists from human cytomegalovirus  TRS  and IRS  generating a chimera capable of reaching wild type virus replication levels in cancer cells in vitro and in tumor models in vivo   The selection of various viral IFN I antagonists that potentially could be used to augment attenuated oncolytic viruses is vast   
For example  increased replication of several viruses  including HIV  Sindbis virus and E deleted adenovirus in mammalian cells was observed when the cells were engineered to express vaccinia virus E L protein  influenza A virus NS  protein  ebola virus VP  protein or HIV  Tat protein   
The choice of antagonist must primarily be made with safety in mind  but virus specific and cell specific differences in antagonist functions may potentially be exploited rationally when considering the overall combination 
For example  vaccinia virus E L is able to rescue VSV but not EMCV from exogenous IFN  whereas vaccinia virus K L partially rescued EMCV but not VSV   In anticipation of systematic  perhaps bioinformatically guided   super chimera  studies  two or more viruses that may complement each other s shortcomings in antiviral defense antagonism have been considered 
Notably  vaccinia virus was favorably combined with IFN I sensitive oncolytic VSV and SFV  yielding tumor model dependent increases in overall therapy efficacy that were dependent on vaccinia virus antagonism of type I IFN responses  which increased the replication of the IFN sensitive viruses   
Such heterologous virotherapy approaches may also be used to generate immunological synergy  similar to heterologous prime boost vaccination  anti tumor immune responses may be increased due to targeting of the tumor by two different viruses  on two separate occasions  but anti virus immune responses would be generated against different viruses each time  avoiding the problem of neutralizing immunity to and predominance of antivirus immune responses   
Some other ideas explored experimentally include engineering oncolytic viruses to express other oncolytic viruses 
For example  the entire oncolytic parvovirus H  genome was placed under a regulatable promoter in oncolytic adenovirus  resulting in a more effective therapeutic entity than either virus alone without loss of tumor specificity   
The genetic material of Semliki Forest virus replicons has been engineered into adenovirus and vaccinia virus backbones   and several other virus chimeras have been constructed   
However  the effects on tumor antiviral defenses of such a constructs remain to be studied The attribute  oncolytic  implies for a virus that it infects and  indeed  lyses the infected tumor 
This property is primarily tested in vitro in cultured tumor cells 
We have learned  however  that in the native tumor microenvironment in living hosts many viruses are no longer able to infect tumor cells or to kill them even if they manage to infect them 
Tightly packed tumor cells and the network of supportive molecules of the extracellular matrix form a physical barrier to virus particle diffusion 
It has also become evident that the tumor cells themselves may be much more capable of thwarting oncolytic virus advances than previously thought  with some tumor cells residing in a seemingly permanent non permissive antiviral state 
Tumors harbor multiple cell types in addition to the neoplastic cells  which may promote and propagate both physical and cellular virus resistance 
As the efficacy of virotherapy in human cancer patients still falls shy of the achievements in animal models  it appears quite plausible that one or more of the barriers described in this review indeed constitute a real and formidable obstacle for oncolytic virus advancement into routine clinical use 
Fortunately  some of the most difficult barriers have been identified  and a rapidly expanding arsenal of countermeasures is at our disposal 
Our task is now to separate the wheat from the chaff and to systematically evaluate the proposed combination regimens that will yield the best results without compromising patient safety Evidence of prenatal toxicity of herbal based indigenous formulations for sex selection in rat modelsTraditional or indigenous preparations  IPs  are getting considerable attention in global health debates  It continues to be used widely in several countries and its consumption is rapidly increasing 
 
  Many reports have documented the use of such preparations 
For instance  in China  traditional herbal medicines played a critical role during the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome  SARS  In fact  many drugs in modern medicine had their roots in the traditional system of medicine 
Drugs like Penicillin  from Penicillium fungi  and Digoxin  from Digitalis purpurea  are some such examples 
One of the promising therapies for Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus  MRSA  infection is a ninth century treatment for eye infections which is a recipe consisting of garlic and onions  wine  and bile from a cow s stomach brewed in a brass cauldron 
It is however important to note that culture specific practices are not always safe 
Digitalis is a classic example where herbalists use this plant in allopathic treatment strategies  while in some countries such as Britain  law restricts their vast availability  A report from Australia describes the adverse effects of ‘herbal  preparations or IPs  Problems arise when people do not report about the consumption of such preparations assuming that these are devoid of any side effects by virtue of them being natural products  The need for research in this field is huge and scientific research into the quality  safety  molecular effects and clinical efficacy is crucial 
 
 
Pregnancy is considered a time of minimal intervention  and a period when herbal medicines are usually contraindicated  It is reported that many women consume indigenous medicines  that contains Bryonia laciniosa  Quercus infectoria and Putranjiva roxburghii along with other ingredients  during early pregnancy to beget a male child in India 
These preparations  often called sex selection drugs  SSD  contain herbal ingredients but these are off the label prescriptions and hence cannot be certified as ‘herbal  medicines 
The prevalence of consumption varies from   to as high as         Studies have indicated that there is  –  times higher risk of birth defects including major malformations of internal organs like urogenital and renal malformation  trachea esophageal fistula  and visible defects like spina bifida  cleft lip palate and imperforate anus 
 
  Risk of stillbirths also increases   folds 
Studies suggest that a single exposure during pregnancy can be deleterious 
 
 
 
  SSDs are reported to contain phytoestrogens  steroids and heavy metals 
 
 
 
  It is also known that although placenta serves as a barrier  most drugs and environmental chemicals enter the foetal circulation by passive diffusion or active transport  However  despite growing evidence on deleterious effects of these herbal formulations  few studies have attempted to systematically understand the risk of such preparations using animal models 
Genetic sex of a child is determined at the time of conception by the fertilization of the ovum with X or Y sperms and intake of so called preparations for sex selection can never alter that In view of these  the current study was conducted with an objective to determine the embryo foetal and development toxicity of SSDs following maternal exposure during critical period of organogenesis using a small animal model The study was guided by the OECD guidelines for testing of chemicals  Guideline no    adopted on  nd January   Prenatal Developmental Toxicity Study  and was based on a mutually approved protocol

The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee  Venus Medicine Research Center 
Due permission was taken from the Ethics Committee of Indian Institute of Public Health Delhi For this experiment  strain of Sprague Dawley of rats  Rattus norvegicus  was used 
The number of dams per group was   instead of   as laid down under OECD guidelines 
Rats of both sexes  –  g  were obtained from National Institute of Biologicals  India at  –  weeks of age  acclimatized for five days and then subjected to the experiment at  –  weeks of age 
They were housed in standard polypropylene rat cages with stainless steel top grill  one dam per cage  at a temperature of       °C  with  –  relative humidity 
Bedding material and cages were changed once in six days and   hourly light dark cycle was followed 
Animals were identified by their existing ear numbering 
Cages were labelled by tags indicating the study number  sex  group of the animals  experimental start and completion dates 
Standard pelleted feed  from Ashirwad Industries  Mohali  India  was provided ad libitum to all the animals 
They also had free access to purified water via drinking bottles throughout the study 
The feed  cages and drinking bottles were not analysed for the presence of phytoestrogens and bisphenol A 
However  similar materials were used for all the rats across all groups The drug comprised of IPs for sex selection  SSD 
These non branded locally made preparations are made available  –  days after placing an order and are never sold openly 
These preparations essentially contain herbal ingredients such as Shivlingi  Bryonia laciniosa  Majuphal  Quercus infectoria  Putrajeevak  Putranjiva roxburghii  Nagkesar  Mesua ferrea  and feather of peacock  Pavo cristatus 
A total of   such samples of SSDs were procured from varied sources like ‘pansari  shop owners  grocers  local alternative medicine practitioners  rickshaw pullers  drivers and commoners from different states 
SSDs are advised to be consumed between   and   weeks of pregnancy The samples were categorized into   groups based on redundancy of the preparations and common ingredients reported 
This was followed by chemical analysis in an accredited laboratory to detect the presence of phytoestrogens and steroids 
Since we explored the toxic effects of these preparations we wanted to select two samples that would be most predictive of toxicity 
Due to resource constraints  we did not want to subject all the   samples for animal study 
Hence  three samples of SSDs  found to be most rich in phenols and steroids were selected for toxicity study  All the three samples were also tested for heavy metals which suggested that Lead and Mercury were in very high quantities  The toxicity was examined using C  elegans  an alternate animal model 
Survival analysis and reproductive toxicity was assessed from the brood size and progeny count assay  The two SSDs that were found to be most toxic were selected as test items for the subsequent study in rat models 
SSD   was reported to contain Shivlingi and Putrajeevak while SSD   contained Shivlingi  Majuphal  Putrajeevak  Nagkesar and feathers of peacock 
Both the samples were obtained from grocers 
Local preparations like these are bound to have certain degree of variability in concentrations but more often than not  these remain the major ingredients According to studies reported  women consume such preparations along with cow s milk in dosages and schedule that are quite varied 
While some advise these IPs to be consumed for one day  others prescribe it for   days  to be taken thrice a day 
We considered the amount of SSDs most commonly reported by pregnant women  weighing   kg  which was  –  g daily for   days 
The dose of the test item   mg kg  was calculated by using conversion factor of  Conversion factor is the ratio of the correction factors  estimated by dividing the average body weight in kgs of species by the body surface area in m  of the species  Km

On the day of dosing  the doses were administered between  –  h  The test items were administered in fresh cow s milk at a final volume of   ml kg 
The doses were calculated on the basis of the latest body weight recorded for the study 
A stainless steel gavage cannula fitted to a calibrated syringe was used for dosing the animals For control animals  cow s milk was used as a vehicle while feeding The study was performed in two phases to evaluate the effect of SSD consumption duration during gestation period Adult  nulliparous female rats were mated with males of same species and strain in  
Each morning  dams were examined for the presence of a vaginal plug and vaginal smear was taken from each dam by using pipette smear technique 
The day of vaginal plug formation or sperms observed in vaginal smear  also known as successful mating  were considered as GD   Gestation day  
The mated females were housed individually in clear polycarbonate cages with stainless steel wire lids 
Mating process was carried out to result in   pregnant animals per group 
Successfully mated females were randomized into control and treatment groups 
All the rats were sacrificed on GD  
According to OECD guidelines  the test chemical should be administered daily from implantation to the day prior to scheduled caesarean section in order to assess toxicity 
Test chemicals were administered to pregnant animals and sacrificed as per the schedule  which was as close as possible to the normal day of delivery without risking loss of data resulting from early delivery i e GD  
The females were killed  before caesarean section  the uterine contents were examined  and the fetuses were evaluated for soft tissue and skeletal changes The pregnant rats were randomized to two intervention and one control groups 
SSD was given during pre implantation to implantation stage  GD  – 
Each group of rats was treated either with vehicle  G  VC  SSD   G    mg kg  or SSD   G    mg kg SSDs were given from GD  – 
Each group of rats was treated with either vehicle or SSD  or SSD 
Allocation of animals was randomized to the following groups  G   Control  VC  G   SSD    mg kg  G   SSD    mg kg  G   SSD    mg kg  G   SSD    mg kg  G SSD    mg kg  G   SSD    mg kg The following parameters were observed •Clinical Signs  Animals were observed once after successful mating or on GD  and after administration of the first dose 
Cage side observations for clinical signs of toxicity in the animals were recorded once daily until the day before necropsy •Body weight  Body weight of all experimental animals were recorded once before mating  initial body weight  and then after confirmation of mating 
Body weights were recorded on days               and on terminal day before sacrifice 
These recorded body weights were used for calculating the dose volume to be administered •Food consumption  Food consumption was evaluated once after successful mating or on day   of gestation  the day of vaginal plug formation or sperms observed in vaginal smear  and on days             and one day prior to sacrifice 
Calculated amount of feed were placed in the trough of each cage and the quantity of feed remaining after approximately   h were weighed and recorded •Morbidity Mortality  All the animals were observed twice daily  once in the morning between   and   h and once in the evening between   and   h  for incidence of morbidity and or mortality •Maternal examination related parameters  At the end of the observation period  all the dams were sequentially euthanized  by CO  asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation  and subjected to gross necropsy 
After termination  dams were examined macroscopically for any structural abnormalities or pathological changes 
Blinding was done while evaluation of the dams during caesarean section and subsequent foetal analyses to minimize bias 
Pregnancy rate was calculated as the proportion of mated pairs that had produced at least one pregnancy within a fixed period where pregnancy was determined by the earliest available evidence that fertilization has occurred 
Gestation index was calculated to indicate number of females with live born as a proportion of number of females with evidence of pregnancy •Examination of uterine contents  Immediately after termination  the uteri were removed and the pregnancy status of the animals ascertained 
Gravid uteri including the cervix were weighed  and number of corpora lutea were determined 
The uterine contents were examined for numbers of embryonic or foetal deaths and live foetuses 
The degree of resorption was described in order to estimate the relative time of death of the conceptus 
Any increase in the number of resorption and or implantation loss is an indicator of litter size for the individual dam •Examination of foetuses  The sex and weight of each foetus were determined 
Approximately one half of each litter were prepared and examined for skeletal alterations from selected dams 
The remainder were prepared and examined for soft tissue alterations  using accepted or appropriate serial sectioning methods or careful gross dissection techniques 
Each foetus was examined for external alterations 
Foetuses were examined for skeletal alterations  using Alizarin Red S staining method 
The fetuses for skeletal staining were kept in pre labelled plastic containers containing   ethanol before staining 
After skinning  we processed the foetus for staining by immersing in   alcian blue   GX for three days  then performed rehydration through a gradient series of ethanol   ethanol   –  h twice    ethanol   –  h  ethanol   –  h  distilled water until the samples sank to the bottom of a conical tube 
Samples were further treated with   KOH for  –  days or until it became clear and again treated with   alizarin red for next  –  days until bones became purple 
Samples were rinsed   times in   KOH  for  –  h at each time point 
Samples were further treated with a gradient series of glycerol  KOH    h   glycerol   h X  Visceral examination was done by micro dissection technique 
Fetuses were preserved in   formalin until they became fixed 
An illuminated magnifier was used for visceral examination 
We placed the foetus in a supine position on a paraffin wax block tray covered with paraffin wax  secured the fetal limbs by paper pins to the paraffin wax block  made a ventral midline incision from the umbilicus  cutting caudally to the genital tubercle and cranially to the diaphragm 
Once incision was completed  we located the ventral attachment of the diaphragm and lifted the liver carefully to examine the diaphragm for abnormal opening 
After observation  the diaphragm was clipped 
We gave a longitudinal cut to open the rib cage slightly lateral to and on the right of the sternebrae and then extended the cut anteriorly to neck region 
The rib cage was opened gently and secured to the paraffin block petridish tray with pins Foetuses were examined for soft tissue alterations  e g 
variations and malformations or anomalies  using Wilson s Technique 
The fetal viscera were examined sequentially  beginning with thoracic organs and moving caudally 
We performed hearts cuts after completion of other observations 
We examined the bilobed thymus for size  shape  coloration and presence of haemorrhages and then removed it for observation of trachea and esophagus 
We observed the lungs for size  color and number of lobes  observed the trachea  esophagus for normal alignment and presence of fistula  opened the pericardial sac and cut off pericardium to expose the heart for observation 
We checked the size  shape  color of the heart and normal development of major blood vessels 
After observation of thoracic viscera  we observed the abdominal viscera and liver for size  shape  color  texture  and number of lobes 
External anatomy of heart was examined by making two incisions using micro dissecting scissors We examined the stomach  spleen  pancreas  small and large intestines for size  position or any other developmental anomalies 
The intestines were moved aside after observation for seeing the underlying structures 
Ureters were checked for normal size and location and for continuity from the renal hilus to the urinary bladder 
One kidney was cut transversely and another was longitudinally to examine renal papilla and renal pelvis 
To confirm the sex of the foetus  the gonads were inspected carefully 
We examined the reproductive organs for size  shape and location GraphPad Prism® statistical software version   was used to analyze the data and all the results were represented as mean   S E M 
Intergroup variance for most of the parameters was calculated by one way analysis of variance  ANOVA  followed by Tukey s test 
A value of p     was regarded statistically significant 
Linear regression was performed to examine the weight change of dams during pregnancy for each group comparing with the control after adjusting for the litter size 
The malformations were analysed by performing Chi square test for trend for two groups  SSD  G  G  G  G  and SSD  G  G  G  G The ARRIVE guidelines were followed to report the findings 
In phase   pre natal study  all the dams dosed with SSD  and SSD  had normal food intake and weight gain 
The average gain in weight from GD  to GD   was       gms for controls while it was       gms in SSD   and       gms in SSD 
 Webtable  
No test item related mortality or clinical sign of toxicity was encountered during the study 
All dams in treatment groups and control group survived to scheduled terminal sacrifice 
They showed normal behaviour until euthanized 
There were no differences in mean maternal body weights  body weight gains  pregnancy rate  gestational index  pre and post implantation loss  and resorptions 
No significant differences were observed in foetal sex ratio  foetal body weights 
However  one dam from SSD  had all male foetuses 
No abnormality was detected in skeletal and visceral examination In phase   controls and SSD  and SSD  treated dams exhibited a comparable food intake  Table  
 
However  a dose response relationship was observed with reduced weight gain with higher doses of SSDs 
 Table  
 
Two dams  one in G   SSD    mg kg  and the other in G   SSD    mg kg  categories showed decreased or consistent body weight GD  onwards 
On an average  the weight on GD   was       gms in controls while it was       with SSD    mg kg  and       gms with SSD    mg kg 
The adjusted analysis indicated that except in G  there was a significant reduction in weight gain in all the intervention groups as compared to the control group after controlling for litter size  Table  
 During follow up  one dam from SSD    mg kg  and one from SSD    mg kg  showed haematuria during gestational day  – 
However  no another clinical sign of toxicity was encountered during the study 
All the dams in treatment and control groups showed normal behaviour and survived to scheduled terminal sacrifice 
In phase   pregnancy rate and gestational index were found to be   at all dose levels with SSD  whereas  in SSD  it decreased to   in G   SSD    mg kg  and G   SSD    mg kg  groups 
One dam from G   SSD    mg kg  and another one from G   SSD    mg kg  group showed mating confirmation during vaginal smear examination and showed positive sign in initial days of pregnancy but during necropsy on expected day of delivery  GD   no foetus was found 
Body weights of dams increased in the initial stages that became constant at a later period 
To reconfirm it  non gravid uterus was stained in salewski strain and presence of conceptus was found 
This indicated the possibility of miscarriage Increased pre and post implantation losses as well as resorptions and reduced live foetuses were observed with both SSD  and SSD 
No significant differences were observed in foetal sex ratio  but decreased foetal body weights were noted in both sexes 
On an average one early resorption in a group was a normal observation 
More than one late resorption was observed in all treatment groups while there was none in the control group 
Total count of live foetuses count was significantly reduced with SSD  and SSD  treatment in a dose dependent manner 
Total number of live foetuses were reduced up to   in SSD  at   mg kg treatment group and   in SSD  at   mg kg treatment group Both SSD  and SSD s at different dose levels showed decreased fetal weight in dose dependent manner  although the difference was not significant 
Skeletal and soft tissue alterations were observed in both treatment groups 
In general  the embryo–foetal examination showed abnormalities  which could have caused some functional damage to these foetuses if allowed to grow in the normal course 
In visceral examinations  slight dilation of the renal pelvis  reduced papilla size  urinary bladder hypertrophy was observed in few foetuses from both SSD  and SSD  treatment groups 
Few incidences of foetal soft tissue abnormalities encountered in this study were normal variants 
Skeletal examination showed variations in the ossification patterns like incomplete or poorly ossified skulls  ossification of sternebra  cleavage ossification of thoracic centrum  asymmetric thoracic centrum  and supernumerary rib in many foetuses in SSD  and SSD  groups  Table  
 
A trend was noted with increased incidence of certain malformations with increasing dosages of SSDs that was statistically significant for most malformations with SSD The results of this developmental toxicity study suggest that administration of SSDs to pregnant rats had significant impact on intrauterine foetal growth  early and late resorption as well as developmental anomalies 
These formulations have teratogenic potential but does not affect sex ratio IPs contain phytoestrogens like diadzein and genistein  In vitro rat whole embryo culture assay  WEC  studies of genistein in rats have indicated fetotoxic and teratogenic potential at concentration of ≥  μg mL  However  in vivo  an oral  gavage  embryonic and fetal development pilot study could not demonstrate any teratogenic effect in the same study 
These findings are different from our study probably because we used SSDs containing natural herbal and non herbal ingredients unlike those studies where synthetic genistein was used 
In both the studies  decreased body weight was observed indicating slight maternal toxicity 
Food consumption was unaffected in our study which is contrary to what was reported 
In another study  pregnant rats exposed to oral isoflavones  diadzein and genistein in varying combinations  showed alterations in the number of live foetuses  lysed foetuses  number of resorption sites  and implantation sites while no clinical signs suggestive of maternal toxicity  seizures  tremors and salivation  that was observed similar to our study 
Maternal mass gain was significantly reduced in rats treated with   mg kg of isoflavones  Ratio of females to males in the litter of different groups was similar akin to our finding  These observations clearly nullify the claim that consumption of SDDs could alter the sex of the growing foetus 
An analysis done by the same authors earlier revealed that SSDs contain testosterone and steroids 
 
  The prenatal testosterone in pregnancy is known to affect sexual development adversely      The principles of reproductive biology state that the genetic sex of an individual is determined at the time of conception and can never be altered under any circumstances 
However  phenotypic sex of the growing foetus is likely to be influenced by the hormonal milieu of in utero environment 
Our analysis was confined to phenotypic sex only and hence it is difficult to state if any differences existed with reference to genetic and phenotypic sex 
This requires further inquiry Evidence on the effects of SSDs on humans should best be obtained from human beings 
The findings of the current study corroborate well with the evidence generated from observational studies in human beings      Presence of skeletal and visceral malformations could explain why stillbirths are likely to be more in women who consume SSDs 
The dosing of the test drugs was intended not only to examine the period of organogenesis solely but to assess effects from preimplantation  through the entire period of gestation to the day before caesarean section 
The results were based on observations of more than   female animals with implantation sites at necropsy that added to its strength 
Unnecessary handling of pregnant animals as well as any stressors from outside was avoided 
At least three dose levels and a concurrent vehicle control were used with dams randomly allocated to different treatment groups that support the validity of the results 
However  absence of   rats per group does not support it to be a fully OECD compliant study 
We did follow the principles of Good Laboratory Practices  GLP  but due to constraints of resources the study could not be conducted as a GLP compliant study  though this is optimal for academic interests There is a lack of systematic approach to assess the safety and effectiveness of herbal preparations 
Ingredients for herbal medicines are often drawn from different sources and are used in combination  which may exhibit variability in terms of species  growing conditions  and biologically active constituents 
To isolate each active ingredient from each herb and then to establish its toxicity is time consuming  resource intensive and not practical 
Moreover  drug approval process does not accommodate undifferentiated mixtures  Though important  it surpasses the herb herb interaction and the potentiating effect of one compound over another 
Therefore  in our study  we administered the herbal mixture to assess the effects 
Real time evaluations have yielded important observations for several herbal drugs especially related to pregnancy 
For instance  Wang et al 
  used mice model to evaluate the adverse pregnancy outcomes after maternal exposure to the herbal medicines  particularly during early pregnancy  The major events included maternal and perinatal mortality 
Maternal weight gain  embryo growth and post natal weight gain were significantly decreased 
Moreover  foetal resorption and skeletal malformations were increased  signifying potential toxicity of Chinese herbal medicines 
This is comparable to our findings To conclude  the results of this developmental toxicity study suggest that administration of SSD  and SSD  to pregnant rats exerted significant impact on intrauterine foetal growth and development without any effect on sex ratio when administered during the period of organogenesis

It is therefore natural to expect that the distribution of amino acids  across all protein sequences  would appear to be fixed  given no mutations over a specific period of time 
Of the   naturally occurring amino acids  each seems to appear randomly located at a particular position within the sequence of a protein 
However  when the sequences of a group of proteins are compared to one another  specific patterns begin to emerge 
These patterns are commonly referred to as motifs and frequently produce similar structural elements and in many cases  similar functions between the proteins that contain them 
In recent years  significant efforts have been made to reduce sequences into discrete motifs  so that each can be linked to some specific biological function based on particular rules      
Databases that consist of identifiable amino acid motifs  such as PROSITE  Pratt and EMOTIF  have been constructed to allow researchers an easy classification of unknown proteins into families based on their common motifs               
All of these methods share one property  they depend on specific alignment algorithms  such as the basic local alignment search tool  BLAST or PSI BLAST  to perform the sequence comparison between diverse families of proteins being analyzed      
These methods have already led to a number of key discoveries and offer the promise of determining biologically meaningful information about function from a protein s primary sequence It is generally accepted that a strong correlation exists between a protein s amino acid sequence and its resulting structure and function         
Techniques that can quickly determine significant similarities between protein sequences are valuable in predicting an unknown protein s function within the cell 
Here we describe a procedure that  by computing the frequency of key amino acid pairs  can quickly classify large groups of proteins into functional groups 
In order to uncover any relevant amino acid strings  we have utilized statistical methods applicable to datasets with large fluctuations in the search of human protein sequences within both the Swiss Prot and Complete Human Genebank databases The goal of this manuscript is to demonstrate how these two residue motifs can be used to develop rapid methods for searching protein or genomic databases in order to locate potentially interesting or aberrant protein sequences 
As an example  we describe the distribution of select amino acid pairs within the genome of the Coronavirus  Tor  which is responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome  SARS    
We have examined additional sets  but the limited format of this paper precludes a large presentation of potential applications The set of all   naturally occurring  amino acids are described by their standard single letter representations  and are taken as the complete set contained within all protein sequences as shown below Zq A R N D C Q E G H I L K M F P S T W Y V Residues that are arranged in a certain order can be referred to as vectors and are represented symbolically as b n b b bn bj Zq The coordinates of each vector represent the amino acid symbols contained within any given protein  where n is the total length of the vector 
The collection of all vectors b n  in the proteome can therefore be denoted simply by Zq n The underlying structure of a protein sequence  which is the order of the amino acids  has unique and identifiable characteristics 
As an analogy  in written English  the letter q is almost always followed by u 
Also  the frequency of the word  and  is much higher than that of the related three letter strings   nad   nda   dan  and  dna  which are simply permutations of the same set of individual letters to construct a word with a different meaning 
Utilizing similar characteristics  we can intuitively scan for unique sequence vectors contained within any given protein 
We expand on these characteristics  by utilizing the concepts of affinity and order stability in Section  Using the entire Swiss Prot database  release number   as the basis for our calculations  we have constructed a probability table for the occurrence of the   naturally occurring amino acids  see Table  
    
In addition to the Swiss Prot database  we have also included data from Complete Human Genebank  NCBI Build Number   March    as a source for all characterized and hypothetical human protein sequences We use the symbol Ω to denote the Swiss Prot database  and the letter M to denote the number of proteins in the database  
Hence we can state that Ω As s M  where As a a as Ns  is the sth protein  ai with i Zq is the ith amino acid in the sequence  and Ns is the length of the protein sequence As 
For any vector b n  if there is a sequence As in Ω such that b n  is a segment of As  then we can say b n  occurs in Ω 
We can then use NΩ b n  to denote the total number of outcomes that b n  has occurred in Ω  and let NΩ n  be the total number of all vectors occurring in Ω with length n  Therefore p b n NΩ b n NΩ n is the probability that the vector b n  occurs in Ω 
We then introduce k p q b n log p b n q b n where p b n  and q b n  are any two probability distributions on Zq n  and b n  belongs to Zq n 
The quantity k p q b n  in Eq 
  is defined for any two probability distributions p b n  and q b n  on Zq n  where the distribution q arises from independent letter  i e  amino acid  probabilities 
Then  k p q b n  can be viewed as a random variable about b n  and its probability distribution is defined as follows F p q x PI k p q b n ⩽x b n k p q b n ⩽xp b n The expectation value μ p q  and variance σ p q  of p b n  are expressed mathematically as μ p q b n Zq n p b n k p q b n 
 σ p q b n Zq n p b n k p q b n μ p q  Hence we see that μ p q  is simply the Kullback–Leibler entropy   
As a consequence  μ p q  is always non negative and μ p q  if and only if p b n q b n 
As a result  the amino acid sequence of b n  can be represented by k p q b n In Eq 
  the probability distributions p  q in the k p q b n  have several possible values 
For example  if we let p be the probability of b n  and only change the value of q in k p q b n  we obtain the following expression q b n j np bj p b p b p bn Based on Eqs 
  and   the value of k p q b n  gives us the affinity for all amino acids within vector b n 
Here two situations are identified as especially interesting i When k p q b n  implies that among the amino acids in vector b n  there is an increased affinity 
That is  the vector b n  occurs more frequently than expected 
 ii When k p q b n  implies that among the amino acids in vector b n  there is a decreased affinity 
That is  the vector b n  occurs less frequently than expected In a similar approach to the condition described above  we may choose q b n p πn b n  where πn b n  is a permutation of b n  and πn denotes a permutation transform 
In this case  the order sensitivity of b n  can also be reflected by the value of k p q b n  and produces the following outcomes i when k p q b n  implies that b n  occurs much more often than πn b n ii when k p q b n  implies that πn b n  occurs much more often than b n In addition to the concepts of affinity and order sensitivity  we can also design other analysis techniques by choosing alternate representations of q b n 
Quantifying the terms k p q b n  we can represent vector frequency numerically 
In cases where k p q b n μ p q ⩾ σ p q  the corresponding vector b n  is called  positive  while in those cases where the opposite takes place  k p q b n μ p q ⩽ σ p q  the vector b n  is called  negative 
By judiciously choosing a   equal to   we obtained   two residue  positive pairs  and   two residue negative pairs  see Table  
  out of a total of   possibilities of amino acid pairs Using any one of the positive motifs from Table   we can develop a test method to detect changes in their distribution through any protein database 
If b b b  is  positive  then p b b μ σp b p b  where p ⋅  is the probability of the amino acids or vectors ⋅ in the database 
Since NΩ μ M Nμ p bj NΩ bj μ MNμ we have NΩ b μ M Nμ μ MNμ μ σp b NΩ b or NΩ b μ M Nμ μ MNμ μ σp b NΩ b and since μ M Nμ is very close to μ MNμfor Swiss Prot database we have NΩ b μ σp b NΩ b and NΩ b μ σp b NΩ b As a consequence of Eq 
  the detection of a deleterious mutation based on the increased appearance of an arbitrary string of these residues becomes possible 
For example  according to Table   CC is an attractive motif with   then NΩ CC μ σp C μ M Nμ μ MNμNΩ C ≈ μ σp C NΩ C Let Ns CC  and Ns C  be the number of CC and the number of C in the sth protein 
Then we have NΩ CC NΩ C  because μ σ  and p C  since NΩ CC s MNs CC NΩ C s MNs C Based upon the result that the CC pair represents a rare event  proteins satisfying Ns CC Ns C  as defined in Eq 
  suddenly become interesting 
We can therefore consider the number Ns CC  as an index to develop detection methods to test for the presence of a CC containing protein within a database 
Using this same reasoning  one can also use any other one of the remaining motifs in Table   to develop detection methods for additional proteins In an identical fashion to the previous example using the positive two residue motifs in Table   we can also use any of the  negative  two residue motifs to develop search methods 
For example  the CM pair is a  negative  two residue  word  with  
That is  p CM μ σp C p M 
Using identical arguments to those described in Section   we obtain NΩ CM NΩ M  and NΩ CM NΩ C 
Since both Ns M  and Ns C  are small numbers for fixed proteins  the overall number of CM pairs in most proteins should be close to zero 
Therefore  we can also use any of the remaining seven  negative  motifs in Table   to develop additional detection methods In contrast to the CC motif  the total number of proteins in the Swiss Prot database having more than one CM pair is quite small 
For example  among the   proteins contained within this database  the number of proteins such that Ns CM ⩾  is   and the number of proteins satisfying the condition Ns CM ⩾  is only  
For human proteins in Swiss Prot  the total number of proteins containing CM pairs is   and there are only   proteins that satisfy Ns CM ⩾   Table  
However  we would expect to find about   proteins having CM pairs in the Swiss Prot database  based upon the amino acid frequencies given in Table   which is greater than the number observed Cysteine rich proteins and the presence of CC pairs in proteins are both concepts that have been studied previously      
If we combine these two concepts and describe them in mathematical terms  we observe that the rates q Ns C Ns and q Ns CC Ns C  describe these two conditions  where Ns  Ns C  and Ns CC  are the numbers of all amino acids  cysteine  and CC  respectively 
We can then derive proteinsNs C Ns p C σ Ns CC Ns C p ξτ C ξτ C σ where σ  and σ  are the standard deviations about Ns C Nss Mand Ns CC Ns C s M respectively We have found the following computational results based on Swiss Prot database σ ≈ σ ≈ andp ξτ C ξτ C ⩾ p C For   we have a much simpler method to determine that a protein sequence is both C  and CC rich if proteinsNs C Ns ∩proteinsNs CC Ns C So  a much simpler method to test whether a protein is a both C  and CC rich for   isNumber of CC  Number of C Number of C  Length of protein Using this principle  we found a total of eight proteins that are both C  and CC rich within the Swiss Prot database For   there is an easier method to determine whether a protein sequence is both C  and CC rich if proteinsNs C Ns ∩proteinsNs CC Ns C So  a much simpler method to test whether a protein is both C  and CC rich for   is based on the inequalitiesNumber of CC  Number of C Number of C  Length of protein Using this principle  we can get a total of   proteins that are both C  and CC rich within the entire Swiss Prot database For   there is also an easier method to determine if a protein sequence is both C  and CC rich sequence when proteinsNs C Ns ∩proteinsNs CC Ns C So  a much simpler method to test whether a protein is both C  and CC rich for   is based on the inequalitiesNumber of CC  Number of C Number of C Length of protein Using this principle  we have identified a total of   proteins that are both C  and CC rich within the Swiss Prot database 
From these results  it becomes clear that there are many C rich proteins and many CC rich proteins that are not mutually inclusive 
The sets of both C  and CC rich proteins are only subsets of the set containing all C rich proteins or that containing all CC rich proteins Because the Swiss Prot database is somewhat biased to those proteins that are of interest to researchers  we have decided to examine a database that was  in essence  complete 
For this  we chose the human subset sequences contained within the Complete Human Genebank database 
This was the most complete and readily available source of human genetic sequences and should therefore provide us with an accurate representation of both CC and CM pair distributions 
We observed that the total number of CC pairs within the human subset of sequences contained in Genebank  a total of   proteins  was  
These pairs were contained within a total of   proteins  Table   a number that is substantially larger than the   we obtained from Swiss Prot data  Table  
Since the total number of amino acids in The Complete Human Genebank is   we can easily get the expected number of CC in Complete Human Genebank is   which is much less than this actual value  
The same also holds true for the CM pair  where we would expect to see   CM pairs  but actually observe    Table  
 
This result is surprising but true and shows that there are fundamental difference between the Human and other species in terms of the frequency of CC and CM pairs To create a single CM pair  it is obvious that one needs only a single C  If a protein sequence also contains a CC pair  the total number of cysteines available to create a CM pair has been reduced by a factor of  
Using the cutoff value of four CC pairs as statistically significant  we determined the probability of finding a CM pair within proteins that already contained a CC pair  Table  
Even though both CC and CM can occur in the same protein  the total number of proteins in Genebank that contain both CC and CM pairs is   and these pairs almost always occur at different locations in the sequence 
However  in some rare cases the second C within the CC pair is shared with the first C within the CM pair  giving us a new triplet CCM If we filter the set of proteins described above for redundant entries  we obtain a set of   unique proteins that contain the CCM triplet in the human proteome 
Using the probability distributions obtained from Swiss Prot  we obtained the probability of CCM as  
Since the total of all protein lengths in the Swiss Prot database is   there should be a total of   CCM triplets 
This value is almost identical to the predicted number of CCM of  
This result suggests that the CCM triplet at least in Swiss Prot occurs randomly 
However  we can also analyze the CCM probability using a different approach  putting q CCM p CC p M  into Eq 
 
If CCM occurs randomly  then we have p CCM p C p C p M  and since p CC μ σp C p C  we will get k p q CCM log p CCM q CCM log p C p CC ⩽ μ σ Based on Eq 
  it is clear that the presence of a CC pair strongly excludes M  Therefore  the probability of the CCM triplet should occur less frequently than that of CC or M individually We have obtained the following statistical results with regard to the total number of CC and CM pairs contained in the Swiss Prot database i The total number of these proteins satisfying Ns CC ⩾  is   and   of these are found in humans 
 ii The total number of human proteins in Ω that satisfy Ns CC ⩾  is  
 iii The total number of the proteins in Ω that satisfy Ns CM ⩾  is     of these are found in humans 
 iv The total number of human proteins in Ω that satisfy Ns CM ⩾  is only

After examining the complete proteome the SARS associated Coronavirus we observed a statistically significant increase in the occurrence of the CC and CM pairs in the SARS associated Coronavirus  genome Of the   putative proteins  four contain either CC or CM pairs 
Two large poly proteins  GI  and GI  contain   CC and   CM pairs  as well as   CC and   CM pairs  respectively 
The putative spike glycoprotein  GI    contains   CC and   CM  while the small envelope protein  GI    contains only   CC pair 
The remaining   proteins  of which two have been identified as a nucleocapsid and matrix protein  contain no CC or CM pairs 
When compared to the occurrence of CC and CM pairs within all human proteins found in the Swiss Prot database  it becomes clear that there is an increased occurrence of these pairs within the SARS associated Coronavirus proteome It is clear that the frequency of CC and CM pairs is significantly higher in the SARS genome than it is in the human genome 
It is our hope that these unique two residue motifs could be used as a means of identifying a virus such as SARS 
While currently impossible to determine  one can see a possible clinical use for determining the frequency of CC or CM pairs in an individual 
If a person has been infected by SARS  we would expect the numbers of CC and CM pairs to be much higher than in a healthy individual 
If we were then able to develop a clinically feasible technique that could identify the CC or CM pair content in total cellular protein  without damaging the cell  it could be possible to implement a detection method simply by counting the numbers of CC or CM pairs in all proteins examined 
If the presence of increased CC or CM pairs was indicative of infection by SARS we could develop new drugs to inhibit the translation of proteins that contain these pairs within infected cells 
As a very specific example  this could be accomplished through the use of specific tRNA mimics that could block translating ribosome when these pairs appear at the P and A site simultaneously      
While tRNA mimics could normally be seen as non specific protein synthesis inhibitors  the lower frequency of the CC or CM motifs in host proteins as compared to the relatively high occurrence in viral protein provide a starting point for the analysis of treatments using methods such as these In this paper we have performed a detailed search of the Swiss Prot and Complete Human Genebank database in relation to the frequencies of each of the   natural amino acids and motifs made up of two residues 
This has provided us with a new insight into the distribution of proteins within these databases and the information that may be contained within a protein s primary amino acid sequence 
Our focus in this quest has been to examine specific pairs or triplets of residues and use probability theory to assess whether or not particular strings of residues occur more frequently than their probability would indicate 
By analyzing affinity and anti affinity  we developed a procedure to search out all two  and three residue clusters within these databases 
Through this technique  we can rapidly classify large groups of proteins into families based on the occurrence of these motifs 
Combining this concept with a specific knowledge of protein function  we propose novel ideas aimed at developing fast detection methods for specific diseases based on the unusually high occurrence of some of these motifs when compared with the expected probabilities 
A timely example of the application of this method is given  namely the analysis of the SARS virus 
This method will hopefully lead to the discovery of new diagnostic techniques and possible treatment of diseases  by recognizing the location of target domains in the expressed sequence Cell type specific expression of the putative SARS CoV  receptor ACE  in human heartsThe coronavirus disease    COVID  caused by SARS CoV  infections imposes a major threat for the world s healthcare systems and is leading to thousands of deaths 
Angiotensin converting enzyme    ACE  has been identified as a potential receptor for SARS coronavirus  and is also considered the main receptor for SARS CoV  SARS CoV  binds to ACE  via its glycosylated outer membrane spike proteins 
ACE  is highly expressed in the lung and heart  and is known for its vital role in the cardiovascular system –  Although SARS CoV  mainly invades alveolar epithelial cells  it can also cause myocardial injury  as assessed by increased troponin T and NT proBNP levels accompanying increased cardiovascular symptoms in COVID infected patients  It is unclear whether elevated biomarkers of cardiac injury  or long term effects on the cardiovascular system  are directly caused by viral infection of cardiac tissue or are secondary to hypoxia and systemic inflammation 
However  patients with underlying cardiovascular disease represent a significant proportion of the patients who may suffer from a severe course after COVID  infection  This situation may be aggravated by findings showing that ACE inhibitors  which are often used to treat cardiovascular diseases  augment the expression of the SARS CoV  receptor ACE  in lung cells  This is probably mediated by an effect on angiotensin II  which is known to reduce ACE  expression  Thus  ACE inhibition decreases angiotensin II  leading to an indirect up regulation of ACE  The effect of angiotensin II receptor blockers  ARBs  which primarily target the angiotensin receptor   is unclear 
One may speculate that ARBs indirectly reduce ACE  levels by augmenting free angiotensin II levels  which in turn is expected to down regulate ACE  via activating the angiotensin receptor  
However  the effect of the two different treatments on the expression of ACE  in the heart requires further investigation Therefore  we used single nuclei RNA sequencing to determine the expression of ACE and ACE  in the different cell types of the human heart 
Gene expression signatures were detected in cardiac tissues of five patients with aortic stenosis  AS  and two patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction  HFrEF   Figure  A  and compared with with samples of one healthy donor heart  age    years  male  that was not used for transplantation 
After single nuclei RNA sequencing  data were pooled  and unsupervised clustering was performed with a total of     nuclei 
We found   distinct clusters 
Using cell type specific gene markers  major cell types were annotated  including cardiomyocytes  six clusters  fibroblasts  one cluster  endothelial cells  three clusters  leucocytes  two clusters  pericytes  one cluster  and smooth muscle cells  one cluster   Figure  B–D 
ACE  was expressed in cardiomyocytes  Cluster   and   and mural cells  particularly pericytes  Cluster   and was detected at a lower expression level in fibroblasts  endothelial cell  and leucocytes  Figure  D 
Comparison of ACE  in a pooled analysis of nuclei of the different groups showed that ACE  was significantly elevated in cardiomyocytes of patients with heart disease compared with healthy controls  Figure  E 
ACE  was also slightly  but not significantly  increased in endothelial cells  and the expression was lower in fibroblasts of patients with heart disease compared with healthy controls  Figure  E 
Immunostaining confirmed an increased expression of ACE  in cardiomyocytes of patients with aortic stenosis  Figure  F 
In addition  ACE was augmented in cardiomyocytes of patients with AS and HFrEF  Figure  G 
Interestingly  cardiomyocytes of patients who were treated with ACE inhibitors showed a significantly higher ACE  expression compared with ARB treated patients  Figure  H 
Moreover  patients treated with ACE inhibitors had an imbalance of ACE to ACE  expression  with a more than four fold higher ACE ACE  ratio compared with healthy control cells  Figure  I In conclusion  these data provide novel insights into the cell type specific expression and regulation of ACE  in the heart 
Patients with varying heart disease aetiology show augmented expression of ACE  levels particularly in cardiomyocytes 
Treatment with ACE inhibitors tends to be associated with increased ACE  mRNA and unfavourable ACE ACE  ratios  which are believed to be a driver of cardiovascular pathologies  This study is limited by its small sample size and therefore is only hypothesis generating 
However  these novel data suggest that it will be important to monitor SARS CoV infected patients for cardiovascular complications and assess the impact of ARB ACE inhibitor therapy 
Conflict of interest  none declared New onset acute symptomatic seizure and risk factors in coronavirus disease   A retrospective multicenter studyIn December   pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus  later called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus    SARS‐CoV‐  was first reported in Wuhan  China 
On March     the World Health Organization  WHO  declared the syndrome caused by SARS‐CoV‐  infection  coronavirus disease    COVID‐  a pandemic 
According to a WHO Situation Report of April    
 
 there are   confirmed COVID‐  cases and   deaths globally 
COVID‐  affects people of all ages 
 
  
 
 and in severe cases  it may cause dyspnea  hypoxia  acute respiratory distress syndrome  and septic shock 
 
  
 

The current situation has raised concerns regarding whether people with epilepsy have a higher risk to be infected with COVID‐  and whether people would develop acute seizures during the course of COVID‐ 
The objective of this study is to clarify the incidence and the risk of acute symptomatic seizures during acute COVID‐  infections This retrospective multicenter study was approved by the ethics committee of West China Hospital  Sichuan University  approval   
The study was conducted in   officially designed hospitals in Hubei province  the epicenter of the COVID‐  epidemic in China  Sichuan province  and Chongqing municipality 
These hospitals included the East Branch of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University  West China Ward  Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital  and hospitals in Sichuan province designated by the government to treat COVID‐   see the list of hospitals in Appendix S People with COVID‐  who were discharged from or died in the participating hospitals between January   and February     were consecutively enrolled 
All cases were diagnosed according to the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for COVID‐   trial version  
 
 All those enrolled tested positive through nucleic acid detection 
Disease severity was classified as mild  moderate  severe  or critical according to the national guidelines  see Box   for classification criteria 
 
 For our study  we aggregated severe and critical cases into a single severe group  whereas mild and moderate cases were aggregated into a single milder group 
The clinical outcome at discharge was either cured or death Electronic medical records of all enrolled cases were reviewed by   neurologists using a standard case report form  Appendix S 
Data were extracted on demographic characteristics  medical history  complications  treatments  and presence of risk factors for seizures 
These risk factors were considered to be the following  acute cerebrovascular disease  traumatic brain injury  TBI  central nervous system  CNS  infection  shock  hypoxia  severe metabolic disturbance  based on criteria from the International League Against Epilepsy
 
  multiple‐organ dysfunction syndrome  sepsis  and exposure to drugs or toxic substances Continuous variables were presented as median  interquartile range  and categorical variables as n  All of   people discharged from or who died at participating hospitals were consecutively identified and enrolled 
Most were from Sichuan province  n     followed by Chongqing  n     and Hubei  n    Ten individuals died  giving case fatality rates of    n     in Hubei     n     in Chongqing  and    n     in Sichuan 
Of the   severe cases      received mechanical ventilation  and     were given sedatives 
Apart from the effect of sedatives  mental state was relatively normal in   people 
Eight were encephalopathic  one was obtunded  one was delirious  and six were comatose 
The diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus was not made in any of these cases based on clinical presentation  results of investigations  or response to therapy 
No routine or long‐term electroencephalogram  EEG  was recorded due to exposure concerns None in this cohort had a past history of epilepsy 
None had any seizures  including febrile seizures  or status epilepticus during hospitalization 
Seizurelike events were seen in two people  it was believed that this was the result of an acute stress reaction in one and hypocalcemia in the other The first was a  ‐year‐old woman who reported bilateral bodily spasms lasting for about   minute  with mouth deviation but no impairment of awareness 
She was evaluated neurologically and psychiatrically and was diagnosed with an acute anxiety disorder  which was treated with olanzapine  paroxetine  and diazepam The second case was a  ‐year‐old woman who displayed bilateral myoclonus in the limbs with no impairment in consciousness   hours after admission 
Although this was initially suspected to represent seizures  she was found to have an electrolyte disturbance including hyponatremia  hypokalemia  and hypocalcemia  and the myoclonus resolved with correction of the metabolic disturbances Eighty‐four   cases reported systemic or direct brain insults that increased their risk for acute symptomatic seizures  Table  
The most common risk factor was hypoxia 
No severe electrolyte disturbance was seen  but hypokalemia  n       hyponatremia  n       and hypocalcemia  n       were frequently seen in the cohort 
Urea  creatinine  and serum glucose levels were moderately altered in most of cases 
In two cases who had chronic kidney dysfunction  substantial increases in creatinine levels were noted 
Results of investigations are shown in Table  
One case with TBI had an epidural hematoma  cerebral contusion  and skull base fracture 
Five people with severe COVID‐  experienced septic shock 
Three other cases of shock had hypovolemia or cardiac problems 
Ninety‐four   were given antibiotics  moxifloxacin  n       piperacillin sulbactam sodium  n       and third‐generation cephalosporins  n       were most commonly used We found no new onset seizures or status epilepticus in a large cohort of people hospitalized during the acute phase of COVID   infection despite a substantial proportion having risk factors for acute symptomatic seizures 
This is useful information  given the prior lack of knowledge about seizure risk during the acute phase of infection No individual in this cohort had a history of epilepsy prior to hospital admission 
To date  there is not much information available on people with epilepsy during the COVID‐  crisis 
There is one report of epilepsy in a case COVID‐  from Wuhan 
 
 As information is limited  it is not possible to establish whether this was a patient who had a history of epilepsy or whether the patient presented acute seizures 
There is at this time little if any evidence indicating that people with epilepsy are at an increased risk of COVID‐  infection 
A major challenge for people with epilepsy in this outbreak is nonadherence with the prescribed antiseizure medication  which was seen during the in SARS endemic in  
 
 This indicates the need to ensure the availability of supplies of medications and to advocate patients  self‐management 
Possible strategies for coping could also include online consultations and telemedicine networks Although many neurological and systemic disorders regarded as potential triggers
 
 of acute symptomatic seizures were identified in this cohort  seizures and status were not seen 
Stroke is one such risk factor 
The risk of developing acute symptomatic seizures after stroke ranges from   to  
 
 Acute cerebrovascular disease is considered a major cause of seizure and status epilepticus 
An earlier study from Hubei
 
  
 
 also reported six people with COVID‐  who had acute cerebrovascular disease without seizure 
Infection of the CNS can also give rise to seizures 
Although there is limited evidence of the presence of the SARS‐CoV‐  in the cerebrospinal fluid  CSF  the co‐occurrence of tubercular meningitis
 
 had been reported  with no seizure or status observed 
To determine whether COVID‐  can cause direct CNS insults requires further follow‐up 
In the earlier outbreaks of another coronavirus  a generalized convulsion with a positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for SARS‐CoV in CSF was reported  which could have been a coincidence 
 

Disturbances of homeostasis may lead to acute symptomatic seizures 
Hypoxia  the most common complication in our cohort  may trigger anoxic encephalopathy  particularly in refractory hypoxia 
Electrolyte disturbances as seen in COVID‐  are considered to be potential causes of acute symptomatic seizure 
 
 The severity and speed of such disturbances may affect onset of seizures  so these parameters should be carefully monitored The cytokine storm syndromes
 
 behind severe infection may cause the production of inflammatory cytokines systemically  with the consequence of acute toxic encephalopathies 
Although sepsis is a common cause of encephalopathy in intensive care medicine 
 
 hypoxia appears far more often than sepsis in COVID‐ 
There was also a high rate of septic shock in the COVID‐  population  varying from  
 
 to   in earlier studies in Hubei 
 
  
 

Certain antibiotics have been associated with symptomatic seizure 
 
 Antibiotics were used in a large number of people in our cohort without problems  but the most used antibiotics in the cohort were of low or moderate risk 
Clinicians should keep this seizure risk in mind when prescribing antibiotics  especially for people with renal dysfunction 
 

Our study has several limitations 
First  as a cross‐sectional study  we only have data from the acute phase of the disease 
A follow‐up study is underway to evaluate longitudinal seizure outcomes 
Second  the retrospective study design meant that we could not collect data on all relevant variables  for example  EEG was not recorded  so subclinical seizures could have been missed 
As all health care costs of COVID‐  treatment are covered by the government  all those suspected of infection are screened 
This may assure the objectivity and reliability of study materials  and it will allow for a future follow‐up study Our analysis suggests that COVID‐  poses minimal risk for seizures during the acute illness  although a significant proportion of severely ill individuals have risk factors that may increase the propensity to experience seizures 
These risk factors should be promptly addressed to minimize the risk of developing seizures 
Prospective long‐term studies must be done to determine whether people who have suffered from COVID‐  have an increased risk for developing seizures or epilepsy in subsequent months or years as a consequence of their illness None of the authors has any conflict of interest to disclose 
We confirm that we have read the Journal s position on issues involved in ethical publication and affirm that this report is consistent with those guidelines Decreased prealbumin level is associated with increased risk of mortality in hospitalized elderly patients with COVID The coronavirus disease    COVID  epidemic is caused by an infection with a novel coronavirus  officially named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus    SARS COV 
The infection spread rapidly on all continents and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization 
As of April       documented cases were reported worldwide  and   patients had died 
As there are currently no specific treatments and medications against the new virus  it is crucial to identify risk factors of severe prognosis Older patients have poorer prognostic factors and are more likely to experience critical disease 
 
 
Based on recent statistical data of China  among patients who were   years and older  the mortality rate was   which was significantly higher than that of younger patients at  
The proportion of deaths over   years old accounts for   of the total deaths in the national wide  which implicates aged people are more vulnerable to the SARS CoV 
Till present there are rare reports in literature focusing on the risk factors for poor outcomes of the elderly patients with COVID Serum prealbumin  known as transthyretin  its levels may be lowered not only by malnutrition  but also by inflammation and aging 
 
 
Compared to albumin  prealbumin has a shorter half life  a more rapid rate of hepatic synthesis  and predictable catabolic rate  hence  it may be a more sensitive indicator 
However  whether prealbumin could be an independent predictor of mortality in hospitalized COVID  elderly patients needs to be further elucidated The present study aims to describe the clinical characteristics and to investigate whether the prealbumin can serve as a valuable predictor of in hospital mortality  which might provide evidence for the risk stratification in elderly and help to improve the clinical practice and reduce fatality We designed this study as a retrospective cohort study design 
The elderly patients with COVID  who were admitted to Tongji Hospital in Wuhan from January   to February     were consecutively included 
This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Tongji Hospital  Approval Number  TJ IRB  and was complied with the Declaration of Helsinki 
The data were anonymous and the study was observational  so the informed consent was not gathered 
A flow diagram illustrating patient selection was described in Figure  
 
Inclusion criteria included elderly patients  ≥   years old  diagnosed with COVID  infection 
A total of   participants have been obtained 
Patients having missing baseline or outcome data  died on admission or being transferred to other designated hospitals during hospitalization were excluded 
There were   patients were included in the final analyses Data collection of participants was performed using hospital electronic medical record system 
Information included medical history  demographic data  physical examination  and hematological  biochemical  radiological and microbiological evaluation results were reviewed 
The data collection forms were reviewed independently by   researchers  CL and LYY 
Blood examinations were assessed at the central laboratory of Tongji Hospital following standard operative procedures 
The routine blood test was analyzed using Sysmex XE  hematology analyzer  Sysmex  Kobe  Japan 
The Cobas C   Roche  Mannheim  Germany  was used to measure the biochemical parameters 
Coagulation tests were detected by STA R MAX coagulation analyzer  Diagnostica Stago  Saint Denis  France 
Throat swab samples were collected and were tested for SARS CoV  with commercial real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  RT PCR  kit from DAAN GENE  Guangzhou  China 
The diagnostic criteria and all clinical procedures in this study followed  Diagnosis and Treatment of Pneumonia Caused by New Coronavirus  Trial version   to   promulgated by the National Health and Health Commission of China Summary statistics of baseline characteristics of all patients and stratification by prealbumin tertiles were expressed as frequency and proportion for categorical variables  mean   standard deviation  SD   Gaussian distribution  or median  range   Skewed distribution  for continuous variables  and as percentages for categorical variables 
The differences between groups were analyzed using the χ   categorical variables  One Way ANOVA test  normal distribution  or Kruskal Whallis H test  skewed distribution We examined the relationship of the prealbumin as categorized into tertiles with the outcomes of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation 
Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to evaluate these relationships  then unadjusted and adjusted odds ratio  ORs  and   confidence intervals  CIs  were calculated 
Model   is the minimally adjusted model with only sociodemographic variables adjusted 
Model   is the fully adjusted model with covariates including age  sex  smoking status  history of hypertension  history of coronary heart disease  history of diabetes  history of chronic kidney disease  history of carcinoma  history of chronic liver disease  neutrophil  lymphocyte  prothrombin time  activated partial thromboplastin time  d dimer  alanine transaminase  aspartate aminotransferase  total bilirubin  blood urea nitrogen  creatinine  C reactive protein and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio 
We calculated odds ratio  ORs  and   confidence intervals  CIs 
The highest tertile was the reference for prealbumin 
We performed test for linear trend by entering the median value of each category of prealbumin tertile as continuous variable to examine the possibility of nonlinearity To ensure the robustness of our results  we also performed stratified analyses with the prealbumin as a continuous variable for the overall population and stratified by gender  age  hypertension status and coronary heart disease status at baseline 
Generalized additive models were used to visually confirm the relationship between prealbumin as continuous variable and the risk of outcomes  all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation Modeling was performed with the statistical software packages R  http www R project org  The R Foundation  and EmpowerStats  http www empowerstats com  X Y Solutions  Inc  Boston  MA 
P values less than    two sided  were considered statistically significant In our study    cases were excluded 
To avoid selection bias due to missing data  we performed a sensitivity analysis 
The results showed that there was no statistical difference between missing group and non missing group  supplemental table  Of   elderly inpatients included in the final analysis  the mean age was     years  ranging from   years to   years  and most patients were male  table  
 
The baseline characteristics of these included participants were listed in table 
The day of sample drawing after admission was       day 
No significant statistical difference in sex  smoking status  body weight  BMI  comorbidity  hypertension  coronary heart disease  chronic kidney disease  cerebral vascular disease  carcinoma  chronic liver disease  symptoms  fever  cough  headache  diarrhea and myalgia fatigue at admission  were detected across different groups of prealbumin  tertile 
When compared with subjects in the highest tertile  those in the lowest tertile were older  more likely to have diabetes medical history  with higher Neutrophil count  lower lymphocyte count  worse coagulation function and liver function 
A total of     patients required mechanical ventilation      patients admitted to intensive care unit and     patients died during hospitalization 
The incidence of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation were significantly decreased across prealbumin tertiles  all cause death    vs    vs    for tertile   vs  tertile   vs  tertile   ICU admission    vs    vs    for tertile   vs  tertile   vs  tertile   mechanical ventilation    vs    vs    for tertile   vs  tertile   vs  tertile   respectively To investigate the correlation between prealbumin and in hospital outcomes  we constructed three models using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models  table  
 
In the unadjusted model  the ORs of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation was significantly increased as the prealbumin tertiles downgraded 
The OR for tertile   was significantly higher than the OR for tertile    OR       CI    to   P   for all cause death  OR       CI    to   P   for ICU admission  OR       CI    to   P   for mechanical ventilation 
Additional adjustment for the demographic variables and comorbidities did not reduce the ORs for the association between prealbumin tertiles and in hospital outcomes 
Further adjusting for the baseline levels of blood examinations  including blood routine  neutrophil  lymphocyte  neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio  coagulation function  prothrombin time  activated partial thromboplastin time  d dimer  liver fuction  alanine transaminase  aspartate aminotransferase  total bilirubin  renal function  blood urea nitrogen  creatinine  and infection indicators  C reactive protein  did not affect the relationships in the fully adjusted models  OR       CI    to   P   for all cause death  OR       CI    to   P   for ICU admission  OR       CI    to   P     for mechanical ventilation 
Therefore  lower tertile of prealbumin exhibited an increased risk of worse in hospital outcomes  full adjusted P for trend for all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation  P     P   and P     respectively Generalized additive models  Fig  
A through  C  were used to visually assess functional relationships between the prealbumin as continuous variate and the risk of in hospital outcomes 
Serum prealbumin was found to have negative linear relationship with the risk of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation To determine the consistency of the relationship between baseline prealbumin as a continuous variable and in hospital outcomes  we conducted stratified analyses  Table  
 
For each unit increase of prealbumin  the adjusted OR for all cause death was   in males  P     and   in females  P    
The adjusted OR for all cause death for persons less than   years of age was    P     compared with    p     for persons   years and older  P interaction    
For each unit increase of the prealbumin  the OR for all cause death was    P     and    P     for normotensives and hypertensives     P     and    P     for non diabetic and diabetes respectively 
The difference of interaction was not significant between two groups  P interaction         and   stratified for gender  age  hypertention and diabetes respectively 
Moreover  the relationship between baseline prealbumin with ICU admission and mechanical ventilation stratified by gender  age  hypertention and diabetes are consistent In this study  we found that lower serum prealbumin significantly associated with an increased risk of worse outcomes and all cause death during hospitalization 
Patients in the lowest tertile of prealbumin were older  and with higher Neutrophil count  lower lymphocyte count  worse coagulation function and liver function compared with subjects in the highest tertile 
Then we adjusted relevant covariates including age  sex  smoking status  comorbidities  neutrophil  lymphocyte  coagulation function  liver function  renal function and C reactive protein to minimize the potential impact of confounding 
Compared with crude regression analyses  this association still persisted when adjusting for demographic and clinical variables in the multivariable regression analyses 
Moreover  stratified by gender  age  hypertension and diabetes  increased level of serum prealbumin was associated with the decreased risk of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation  which determine the consistency of the relationship between lowest serum prealbumin tertile and the increased risk of worse outcomes in elderly COVID  patients Several previous studies have demonstrated baseline prealbumin change in COVID  patients 
Decreased level of prealbumin was observed among COVID  patients 
Wu C et al investigated   patients with COVID  and observed that prealbumin was associated with the development of ARDS  indicating the potential value of prealbumin level on COVID  clinical ending 
Till date  no report exists on the effect of prealbumin in COVID  elderly patients High proportion of severe to critical cases and high fatality rate were observed in the elderlyCOVID  patients  and rapid disease progress was noted in the dead 
One possible explanation involves the greater potential of seniors to be in a state of inflammation  nutritional deficiency and other complications 
Prealbumin is a globular  non glycosilated protein  synthesized by the liver  and complexed with a retinol binding protein  which acts as a transporter of retinol vitamin A and thyroid hormones 
Low plasma prealbumin level has far back emerged as an earliest laboratory indicator of poor nutritional status 
 
 
In addition  prealbumin are also associated with inflammation 
Previous studies showed that in response to the inflammation  the body responds by synthesizing a large number of cytokines 
These include interleukins and tumor necrosis factors that down regulate  decrease  plasma concentrations of albumin and prealbumin 
 
 
Therefore  assay of serum prealbumin concentration is recommended by some investigators as a screening marker for both malnutrition and inflammation Elderly with low plasma prealbumin levels mean that those people are at greater risk of malnutrition and inflammatory conditions  which may lead to poor prognosis 
Malnutrition is commonly seen in hospitalized patients in both the developed and developing world  especially among elderly patients 
A review of   published studies of acute care patients reported that malnutrition incidence ranged from  –  of hospitalized elderly 
It was found that compared to non famine regions of India  experiencing famine had significantly higher influenza mortality rates during the   Influenza pandemic 
Aging  frailty  and chronic diseases are associated with impaired immune function and are compounded by immune dysregulation from malnutrition 
When immune response is dysregulated  it would result in an excessive inflammation  even death 
In the current COVID  study  it was found that elderly patients have higher levels of white blood cells counts  CRP  inflammatory cytokines and are more likely to experience critical disease than did those younger patients 
 
 This retrospective cohort study included   elderly COVID  patients  until the date of February       of patients required mechanical ventilation    of patients admitted to intensive care unit  and the total in hospital mortality was  
The mortality rate was lower than that reported by wang L et al  among elderly COVID  patients 
This may have been the reason for some patients at the date of February     are still in hospital 
Nevertheless  this would not bias the relationship between prealbumin and in hospital outcomes because of the definite observation time we set previously 
Moreover  Wuhan tongji Hospital as one of the largest third grade Class A hospitals equipped with advanced life support training and equipment may partly account for the moderate mortality The results of this study have several clinical implications and strengths 
A low prealbumin concentration can therefore be regarded primarily as a signal identifying the at risk elderly patient who would suffer worse outcomes and requires careful assessment and monitoring for whom nutritional support and Inflammation detection may be needed as part of the treatment plan 
As observational study was susceptible to various confounders  we adjusted many variables that may affect the relationship between prealbumin and in hospital outcomes to minimize potential confounding 
In addition  we tested the robustness of the results by repeating the analyses in different subgroups of gender  age  history of hypertension and history of diabetes Our study has some limitations 
First  by including patients still in hospital as of J February     the case fatality ratio in our study cannot reflect the true mortality of elderly COVID 
Second  the record of data may be affected by prehospital medication and the time interval between admission and onset 
Third  since all subjects in our study were hospitalized Chinese elderly patients diagnosed with COVID  results of this study might not directly be applied to other ethnicities and age groups In conclusion  this retrospective cohort study revealed that the prealbumin is an independent risk factor for the in hospital mortality in the Chinese COVID  elderly patients 
Nutritional support and Inflammation detection should be careful assessment and monitoring for the elderly patients with low prealbumin concentration

Coping With COVID  Emergency Stress  Secondary Trauma and Self Efficacy in Healthcare and Emergency Workers in ItalyThe coronavirus disease  COVID  or the acute respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus    SARS CoV  began spreading in China at the end of   and  to date  represents an international health emergency without precedents in terms of its health  economic  and organizational effects on people s lives  World Health Organization   
After China  Italy was the first country to be affected by this epidemic  with the first deaths on February     and a rapid increase in the spread of infection and mortality 
COVID  was first detected in Northern Italy  and it then spread  although at different rates of incidence  to the other regions 
It was immediately evident that healthcare and emergency workers were at great risk of contagion and that protection and intervention protocols needed to be introduced in the absence of adequate points of reference because of the exceptional nature of the epidemic  the rate of spread of the infection  the seriousness of patients  health condition  and the mortality index 
The extreme conditions in which health workers have had to work  especially in the most affected regions in Northern Italy  are indicated by the following data from the Italian National Institute of Health   over   doctors died and   other health workers were infected within the general context of the population of   deaths and   infections in a span of   weeks 
It was also clear that the medical staff would experience serious psychological repercussions because of the working conditions as well as the difficulty of having scientific points of reference on care and intervention procedures 
To this must be added the increase in workload  the extension of working hours and  for health workers  the frequent exposure to the suffering and death of their patients 
Therefore  healthcare and emergency workers were subjected to serious psychological as well as physical stress 
Hence  the aim of this study  which was also the aim of a previous study  Vagni et al    is to focus on the similarities and the differences in the stress management of two professional groups healthcare and emergency workers during the acute phase of the pandemic 
Both groups have had to deal with COVID patients as frontline responders and have been exposed to the related risks of infection and psychological consequences  which  to date  have not been examined in detail through a comparative analysis As regards the stress that they experience  the literature clearly explains that healthcare and emergency workers who intervene in emergency situations are exposed to the risk of developing dysfunctional reactions that can be identified at different levels physical and or physiological  e g  psychosomatic disorders  sleep wake cycle alterations  and sense of tiredness  emotional  e g  irritability  nervousness  agitation  anger  low self esteem  and guilt  cognitive  e g  distractibility  sense of ineffectiveness  and negative anticipation of events  and relational  e g  increase in conflicts within emergency teams and or with their organization institution  and social withdrawal and may also develop reactions from secondary trauma  Del Missier et al    Sbattella    Argentero and Setti    Fraccaroli and Balducci    Bellelli and Di Schiena    Walton et al   
Faced with stressful events regarding which they lack previous experience and specific  necessary knowledge  and which cause tension owing to the need for rapid decision timings and a sense of responsibility  emergency workers may experience a sense of decision ineffectiveness 
In fact  emergency situations are characterized by high levels of decisional and operational uncertainty with associated regret and guilt  Del Missier et al   Several studies have highlighted that insufficient instructions and a lack of personal protective equipment  PPE  are important predictors of stress for healthcare and emergency workers in large scale emergencies  Oh et al    Du et al    El Hage et al    Walton et al   
Oh et al 
  highlighted that nurses involved in managing the Middle East respiratory syndrome  MERS  experienced lower levels of stress when the levels of goods supply and hospital training were higher 
Some studies have highlighted that frontline healthcare workers had lower secondary traumatization scores than non frontline health workers and the general public in contrast to the findings of previous research on the SARS outbreak in the same area in Singapore  Chan and Huak   
According to Barleycorn   and Tan et al 
  these results may be due to the dedicated training and psychological support given to healthcare workers after the SARS outbreak and demonstrate the validity of policy strategies for prevention of stress in the psychological health field An analysis of   studies published from January to March   aimed at investigating the stress experience of healthcare workers in facing COVID  shows that health workers experienced symptoms of depression and anxiety related to this stressful experience 
Moreover  the severity of their symptoms was influenced by their age  gender  role  specialization  type of activity performed  and exposure to patients with COVID  however  prevention  resilience  and social support interventions mediated their response to stress  Bohlken et al   
In a review of the literature  Spoorthy   underlined that sociodemographic variables  such as age  gender  profession  and workplace  and psychological variables  such as poor social support and self efficacy  affect the stress level experienced by health workers 
In addition  COVID  emerged as an independent stress risk factor 
Xiao et al 
  found that social support plays a role in reducing the anxiety levels in medical staff and increases their sense of self efficacy According to Walton et al 
  the specific stressors that health workers face in the COVID  emergency are related to the organizational context 
The challenges for medical staff include not only an increased workload but also a fear of infection  the need to work with new protocols that change frequently  and the use of PPE 
In uncontrollable situations such as a pandemic  when specific action protocols are absent and limited resources are available  health workers must make individual decisions with a heavy burden of responsibility that may be contrary to their moral principles 
For example  in the case of COVID  they may have to choose which patients to save because only a few places are available in intensive care 
In this regard  Cai et al 
  showed that for a sample of   healthcare professionals who worked closely with COVID  patients in Hubei  the most stressful factors were the lack of protocols for the treatment of COVID  the scarcity of PPE  the exhausting work shifts  their concern about the risk of infection  and their exposure to the death and suffering of their patients 
They also found that the support of superiors proved to be one of the most important motivational factors for medical staff  and the presence of clear guidelines and effective safety protocols were protective factors against the development of stress  in particular  for females 
Further  Walton et al 
  identified the organizational stressors as the changes in work shifts  the prevalence of night shifts  an excessive workload  staff roles  autonomy  the lack of support from superiors  and the absence of adequate information and clear instructions 
On the basis of these stressors  they estimated that   of the medical staff working on the front line of this pandemic are at risk of developing post traumatic stress disorder  PTSD 
In addition  limited resources  longer shifts  decreased hours of rest  and the occupational risks associated with COVID  exposure have increased the physical and mental fatigue  stress  anxiety  and burnout of these staff members  Sasangohar et al   The loss of a social support network  which can be an important resilience factor  is another risk factor  Ozbay et al   
In the COVID  emergency  healthcare and emergency workers have often experienced a separation from their affective links  either because of the restrictions on social contacts imposed by the lockdown or the fear of spreading the infection to their family members 
To this must be added that although  at first  health workers received unanimous encouragement from the population  later  they also experienced demonstrations of stigma and isolation 
Some studies have shown that being able to resort to their own social support network is a significant protective factor for health workers dealing with this emergency  Cai et al   As Favretto   stated  when individuals experience situations that go beyond their coping strategies  their vulnerability to  and risk of developing  psychopathological reactions increases 
Studies conducted during previous epidemics  such as the SARS  MERS  and Ebola epidemics  converge in detecting how healthcare and emergency workers may experience extremely high levels of stress and even develop secondary traumatic stress or vicarious trauma 
This trauma is defined as an experience of symptoms similar to those found in people with PTSD  such as in emergency nurses working with traumatized patients  Beck   
Figley   defined it as a form of stress that derives from the feelings of empathy experienced when helping traumatized people 
The symptoms may include intrusive recurring thoughts  disturbed sleep  fatigue  physical symptoms  hyperarousal  increased stress response  anxiety  depression  and feeling emotional  Adriaenssens et al   
Wolf et al 
  described how nurses may feel  overwhelmed  and this condition becomes a source of moral distress that triggers feelings of powerlessness  guilt  fear  anger  and frustration The sense of frustration and impotence felt by nurses when they are unable to treat and save a patient has been highlighted as a risk factor for secondary traumatic stress in several studies  Missouridou   
Avoidance and emotional numbing can become tools for self protection from intrusive symptoms that exceed the personal tolerance level  Coetzee and Klopper    Mealer and Jones   
Their frustration obviously intensifies on a patient s death 
The onset of PTSD in the health workers involved in treating MERS was also detected after the acute phase of the emergency was over  highlighting a risk not only in the immediate period but also in the medium term period  Lee et al   In reference to COVID  updated studies conducted on Chinese health workers have already highlighted the strong impact of the epidemic on the psychological health of doctors and nurses 
Some studies have found that healthcare workers have high levels of anxiety  depression  insomnia  and distress  Lai et al    Li et al    Zhu et al   
In particular  female professionals with more than   years of experience and previous psychiatric pathology present more risk factors of developing the symptoms of stress  anxiety  and depression  Lai et al    Zhu et al   
Huang J 
Z  et al 
  studied stress levels during the COVID  emergency in a sample of medical staff 
They found that females showed higher levels of anxiety and PTSD than males did and that the levels were higher for nurses than for doctors 
Moreover  Li et al 
  found that nurses had developed higher levels of vicarious trauma than those of the general population and that nurses who did not work closely with COVID  patients showed a more severe symptomatology  both physical and psychological  compared with their colleagues working on the frontline emergency services 
In Italy  a study conducted on healthcare workers found that doctors and nurses developed high levels of stress and anxiety  greater than those developed by the general population  and that healthcare workers operating in the North  the area of Italy most affected by the virus  showed a more severe symptomatology  Simione and Gnagnarella   
This study also confirmed that females tend to have a greater perception of the risk of infection  which increases their risk of developing the symptoms of anxiety and distress Because of their long  intense exposure to various stressors  it is important to note the nature of the coping strategies used by these healthcare and emergency workers in these situations and their effectiveness in terms of reducing and effectively coping with stress 
Indeed  the effective management of stress levels in the acute emergency phase could reduce the risk of developing long term PTSD or other pathologies  such as anxiety and depression  Fullerton et al    Slottje et al    Argentero and Setti    Sakuma et al    Birinci and Erden    Li et al   
Coping may be defined as a series of cognitive and behavioral efforts to manage specific internal or external issues that test or exceed individual resources  Lazarus and Folkman   
A distinction can be made between problem focused and emotion focused coping strategies 
The former is aimed at modifying and solving the stressful situation through active interventions 
By contrast  emotion focused coping is aimed at managing the emotions connected to the stressful event and regulating affective reactions  such as anxiety and the tension of response to stress  for example  by trying to avoid the threat  denial  or re evaluating it  reappraisal The choice of coping strategies is influenced by the individual s cognitive evaluation of the event  termed secondary evaluation  which involves estimating the resources available and the most effective strategies to deal with the situation  Lazarus and Folkman   
A key element of this assessment is the extent to which the individual can maintain control over the outcome of the situation 
The literature indicates that individuals apply dysfunctional coping when they face an uncontrollable event by responding primarily with a coping strategy focused on the problem  and conversely  when they face a controllable situation  they respond with coping strategies focused on emotions  Strentz and Auerbach    Vitaliano et al   
A coping strategy may be defined as adaptive when the controllability of the stressful event corresponds with the choice of coping strategy  in this case  the subject will experience fewer symptoms related to stress  Park et al   The strategies used to cope with trauma may differ among individuals  but they can also vary according to the profession and the features of the traumatic event  Nydegger et al   
Individuals differ in their choice of coping strategies  Connor Smith and Flachsbart    and factors related to the situation can also have a decisive influence on such choice  Brown et al   
A few studies have considered the ways in which gender influences the perception of stress in emergency situations and the choice of coping strategy 
These studies highlight that females tend to perceive events as more negative and uncontrollable and to resort more to coping strategies focused on emotions and avoidance  whereas males tend to resort more to applying problem focused coping and to inhibiting emotions  Matud    Matud et al    Matud and Garcia   The literature on the relationship between coping strategies and the stress levels of emergency workers has shown that the use of coping strategies focused on the problem usually tends to correlate with lower stress levels  both in healthcare workers  Watson et al    Howlett et al    and in other emergency workers  such as firefighters  Brown et al   
However  a coping strategy frequently used by emergency workers is that of avoidance and minimization  and this strategy is associated with higher levels of stress  Brown et al    Chang et al    Kerai et al    Witt et al    Theleritis et al   
Loo et al 
  found that in a group of emergency workers  avoidance as well as coping strategies focused on emotions were associated with the development of post traumatic symptomatology 
Rodríguez Rey et al 
  revealed that among health workers working in a pediatric emergency department  approximately   of the variance in PTSD was explained by the frequent use of coping strategies focused on emotions and the infrequent use of those focused on the problem 
In addition  Kucmin et al 
  who considered a sample of   paramedics  highlighted that the risk of developing PTSD symptoms was predicted by the use of coping strategies focused on emotions However  the literature does not offer unanimous results 
Chamberlin and Green   found that in a group of firefighters  all coping strategies actually correlated with high levels of stress  the authors explained this finding by suggesting that it is not the individual coping strategies that are maladaptive in themselves  but that greater effort is needed to adjust in stressful situations 
By contrast  Young et al 
  indicated that firefighters use problem focused coping strategies more often at the beginning of the operation and emotion focused coping strategies more commonly in the phase of breakdown and fatigue 
However  after the incident  they use both strategies  Young et al   
A meta analysis by Shin et al 
  highlighted that different coping strategies have different effects on work burnout  in particular  emotional stress and depersonalization are associated with the use of emotion focused coping strategies  whereas professional ineffectiveness is associated with the use of problem focused strategies Further  a few studies have investigated the coping strategies that emergency workers can use during health emergencies similar to COVID 
Maunder et al 
  revealed that healthcare professionals who tended to apply dysfunctional coping strategies  based on avoidance  hostile comparison  or self blame  tended to develop higher stress levels 
Wong et al 
  highlighted that during the SARS epidemic  doctors and nurses tended to use different coping strategies 
The doctors tended to turn more to action planning  but this strategy did not affect their stress level 
Instead  their stress level was positively correlated with their use of coping strategies based on emotional outlets 
By contrast  the nursing staff tended to resort more to behavioral disengagement and distraction strategies  which  however  correlated with higher levels of stress among them In this regard  during the MERS epidemic  hospital staff tended to adopt coping strategies related to the use of PPE and the adoption of all prevention measures  as well as social support  whereas the coping strategy that they adopted the least was that based on an emotional outlet  Khalid et al   
A recent study on healthcare workers in Hubei  China  during the COVID  epidemic  Cai et al    yielded similar results  to reduce stress  the medical staff tended to rely on active coping strategies  such as using security protocols  practicing social isolation measures  and seeking support from family and friends  but they did not find it necessary to discuss their emotions with a professional 
Huang L  et al 
  found that a sample of nurses working during the COVID  emergency presented greater emotional reactions and turned more to problem focused coping compared with university nursing students 
Emergency workers must have sufficient self efficacy in terms of their coping skills to be able to manage and cope with stress levels 
Self efficacy in coping appears to be an effective protective factor in relation to stress levels and maladaptive responses  Chesney et al   
Self efficacy to cope with traumatic events has been effective in reducing the risk of developing PTSD  Bosmans et al   The main objective of this study is to identify the coping strategies activated by healthcare and emergency workers to deal with stress factors related to the COVID  emergency that may be associated with the risk of developing vicarious or secondary trauma 
Few studies have considered both groups simultaneously when analyzing the strategies they have adopted to manage stress during the COVID  emergency 
Hence  in this study  we are interested in detecting the similarities and differences in the approaches they adopted to manage their stress during the acute phase of the current pandemic According to Walton et al 
  the main acute stress reactions of emergency workers to emergency medical situations are emotional  cognitive  physical  and social reactions 
Therefore  these factors were included in the questionnaire used in the present study 
Moreover  reactions linked to stress factors for difficulties due to ineffective decision making and dealing with stress were also considered  Chesney et al   
In addition  fears regarding contracting the virus and infecting their own families because of COVID  were specifically considered  Du et al    Huang J 
Z  et al    Ornell et al    Walton et al   Based on results found in the literature  the specific objectives of this study are as follows Participants were selected on a voluntary basis through a trasversal sampling in order to take a picture of the situation caused by the pandemic emergency 
We used an internet platform to conduct the study and approached the participants using social media  dedicated mailing lists  and forums 
Participants from all Italian regions completed the questionnaire online 
The sample consists of   participants  males   and   females  whose average age was   years  SD     min   – max  
Further    of the sample were married    were separated  and the remaining   were single 
We selected various professional figures who had directly worked in various sectors during the COVID  emergency and who could be divided into two main groups 
The first  the  Health Group  consists of   participants   who were healthcare workers    doctors     nurses     psychologists   and seven healthcare assistants  
Their average age was   years  SD     and their average years of active professional service was    SD    
The second  the  Emergency Group  consists of   participants     emergency workers     firefighters   and   Civil Protection staff   whose average age was   years  SD     and average years of service was    SD    
There was an age difference between the two groups  t     p   and the distribution of the gender variable differed between the two groups  with   males and   females in the Health Group and   males and   females in the Emergency Group  χ    p    
The study involved participants from the entire national territory  and their workplace could be divided as follows      and   were from North  Central  and South Italy  respectively 
Further    of the sample worked directly with COVID  patients and   worked in specific COVID  departments 
Among the healthcare workers    had worked in direct contact with COVID  patients  whereas among the emergency workers  only   had assisted these patients  χ    p    
In the present study  we included two variables  lack of necessary instructions and lack of PPE  in accordance with the findings in the literature on their impact on the stress reactions of healthcare and emergency workers during the COVID  pandemic 
Among the participants    and   of healthcare and emergency workers  respectively  did not have sufficient instructions to intervene  χ    p n s 
  and   and   of healthcare and emergency workers  respectively  lacked adequate PPE when working  χ    p n s 
 This study used an online questionnaire and was conducted during the lockdown period owing to the COVID  pandemic 
The questionnaire had three parts  one each to collect online informed consent and baseline sociodemographic information  and one with an online series of questionnaires  as described in the next section 
Participants  anonymity was maintained in collecting the data 
The institutional Ethics Committee approved all the procedures This instrument s   items enable verification of the presence of two symptoms of vicarious trauma  Intrusion and Arousal  and their relative frequency 
The STSS was built on the basis of the conceptualization expressed in the DSM   American Psychiatric Association    regarding the characteristic PTSD symptoms 
In detail  the Arousal items describe situations characterized by anxiety  confusion  physical and psychological complaints  and agitation 
Intrusion refers to the re experiencing of the traumatic event even if not directly suffered through internal images and memories 
Instructions for the STSS I indicated that respondents should specify how frequently an item was true for them in the previous   weeks 
The statements are evaluated on a  point scale     never      very often  that provides scores for Intrusion  example items   I thought about my work with victims when I didn t intend to   Reminders of my work with clients upset me  and Arousal  example items   I had trouble concentrating   I was easily annoyed   I expected something bad to happen   I felt jumpy 
The reliability coefficients of the instrument are   and   for Arousal and Intrusion  respectively This is a  item measure of perceived self efficacy for coping with challenges and threats 
This measure focuses on the changes in individuals  confidence in their ability to cope effectively  based on the self efficacy theory  Bandura    Chesney et al   
Participants were asked   When things aren t going well for you  or when you re having problems  how confident or certain are you that you can do the following  Then  they were asked to rate on an  point scale the extent to which they believed they could perform important behaviors for adaptive coping 
The instrument yields three subscale scores   problem focused coping   α      stop unpleasant emotions and thoughts   α     and  support   α    
Anchor points on the scale are    cannot do at all     moderately certain can do  and    certain can do We constructed an ad hoc  item questionnaire that included Yes No questions to detect stress factors identified by the literature  such as the availability of suitable equipment and the receipt of clear instructions during the COVID  coping experience 
In this study  we present the results related to two of these items   Instructions  which refers to having received the necessary instructions to intervene  and  Equipment  which refers to having PPE 
Predictions of these factors have also been made in other studies  Du et al    Walton et al   
In light of the relevance and specificity of the lack of clear information or instructions and adequate PPE in the management of COVID  in the Italian context  as well as the findings in other studies  we decided to focus attention on these two risk factors Our analysis of the literature revealed that in situations in which they have to cope with a pandemic  several factors may affect the stress of medical staff and emergency healthcare workers and that COVID  represents an independent specific stressor  Spoorthy   
These stress factors have been identified as frequently affecting healthcare and emergency workers in emergency situations and leading to physical  emotional  cognitive  decision making  relational  and organizational stress  Del Missier et al    Sbattella    Argentero and Setti    Fraccaroli and Balducci    Bellelli and Di Schiena    Du et al    Walton et al   
Focusing on the specificity of the COVID  epidemic  items have been constructed regarding the fears of contracting the infection and of infecting colleagues or family members  Walton et al    since COVID  represents a factor of independent stress  Spoorthy    that has great impact  Huang J 
Z  et al   
Consequently  we constructed the ESQ consisting of   items assessed on a  point Likert scale  with scores ranging from    not at all  to    very much  grouped into six scales 
The participants were asked to indicate how often they experienced certain emotions and thoughts while performing intervention and emergency activities during the COVID  pandemic The scales correspond to the factors identified and confirmed by factorial analysis through an analysis of the main components with orthogonal rotation of factors  varimax 
The number of factors to be extracted was initially verified through the unit s largest eigenvalue criterion and  subsequently  by the scree test 
The ESQ is based on six scales The ESQ demonstrated good internal consistency  α     overall and for each individual scale  Organizational–Relational Stress  α     Physical Stress  α     Inefficacy Decisional Stress  α     Emotional Stress  α     Cognitive stress  α     and COVID  Stress  α    First  we performed Pearson s correlation analyses to identify the associations between the variables for the two groups that we considered in this study 
Subsequently  we checked for significant differences between the two groups as their stress levels  coping strategies  and secondary trauma 
We used hierarchical linear regression models to verify the predictive effect of the risk factors  lack of adequate information and PPE  on the different stress levels  in step  
Then  we verified the protective effect of the coping strategies  in step  
The models were controlled for age  gender  and group 
Lastly  we used hierarchical regression models to verify the predictive effect of stress factors on the components of secondary trauma 
The models were controlled for age  gender  and group First  we conducted correlational analyses and comparisons of averages on the reference sample 
Table   shows the correlations between the scales of the ESQ and the other instruments Preliminary comparisons were made through the Student s t test between the Health Group and the Emergency Group in relation to the ESQ  CSES SF  and STSS I scores 
Table   shows the comparison between the two groups As shown in Table   significant differences emerged between the two groups in relation to their Stress and Arousal levels 
The results indicate higher levels of both for the Health Group  and that emergency workers turn more to the Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts strategy 
Further  we performed comparisons with reference to the gender variable to detect differences in the levels of stress factors  coping strategies  and secondary trauma 
Females reported significantly higher Physical Stress than males did  Females  M     SD     Males  M     SD     t     p     as well as Emotional Stress  Females  M     SD     Males  M     SD     t     p     and COVID  Stress  Females  M     SD     Males  M     SD     t     p    
No gender difference emerged in coping strategies and secondary trauma 
Within the Health Group  there were significant differences regarding Inefficacy Decisional Stress  F     p     Doctor M     SD     Psychologist M     SD     average difference     p     and COVID  Stress  F     p     Nurse M     SD     Doctor M     SD     difference     p    
Within the Emergency Group  there were no differences in levels of stress and secondary trauma or coping strategies 
Moreover  we found similar correlations between the two groups for the Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts strategy and the stress factors  whereas for the other two coping strategies  we found a different association  particularly for the Emergency Group 
However  the t test comparisons highlight differences only at the level of the Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts strategy 
Given the findings of the preliminary analyses  we considered it necessary to include the age  gender  and group variables to test the predictiveness of the coping strategies on the participants  stress levels To test the predictive effect of the coping strategies on various levels of stress  hierarchical regression was conducted 
Considering the Age and Gender differences within the groups  we included these variables in all models together with the Group variable  Health vs 
Emergency  and the  Instructions  and  Equipment  variables 
The models generated by assuming the ESQ scales as dependent variables are shown in Table  
Regarding the coping strategies  we observed an important effect of the Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts Coping strategy on all the stress scales  except for Physical Stress where the effect of the Focused Problem Coping strategy is recorded As shown in Table   significant negative associations between stressors and secondary trauma were found for both groups 
The hierarchical regression models of stress scales were analyzed for the Arousal and Intrusion levels of secondary trauma 
The models included the Age  Gender  Health Emergency Group variables  and the ESQ scales 
The results are shown in Table  The same regression models were generated by including coping strategies as predictors and were analyzed by Age  Gender  and Health Emergency Group 
Compared with Arousal  the Health Emergency Group and Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts are predictive  R    F     p     Beta  ∗∗∗  Beta  ∗  respectively 
Compared with Intrusion  only the Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts variable  R    F     p     Beta  ∗  assumes significance This study has several limitations 
The first is the limited sample size 
The second is that our study involved participants in the very midst of the COVID  emergency  which means that the level of stress in healthcare workers may have been more severe and acute 
Moreover  the long term psychological implications for the healthcare and emergency population should be investigated for the presence of a full secondary trauma 
Therefore  a large sized longitudinal study is called for to further explore the pathogenesis of vicarious traumatization 
The third is that participants were not selected based on whether they had existing psychological problems 
In proposing the hypothesis of this study  we anticipated that we would be able to discover the relationships between coping strategies  emergency related stress  and secondary trauma in healthcare and emergency workers and commenced our investigation by assuming that the impact of stress can provoke psychological consequences in emergency situations 
In future work  this assumption could be tested to verify whether an emergency situation has a different impact on workers who have already experienced psychological problems The raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors  without undue reservation  to any qualified researcher The studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by Comitato Etico per la Sperimentazione Umana – CESU of the University of Urbino

As reported by some  the association of acute kidney injury  AKI  and COVID  has a high mortality   
However  the incidence of reported AKI associated with COVID  varies widely             
It would be expected that kidney involvement is frequent since the virus enters the cell through the angiotensin converting enzyme    ACE  which is expressed  in addition to pulmonary type   alveolar cells  on renal proximal tubular cells  glomerular visceral and parietal epithelium  and the cytoplasm of the distal tubules and collecting ducts         
In addition  COVID  induces hemodynamic instability and severe inflammation  which  in addition to direct renal infection  can induce acute tubular necrosis  ATN 
We report our experience with AKI in COVID  patients in an inner city  predominantly minority  and a low socioeconomic group and compare our experience with other studies in significantly different cohorts of patients 
We identify the incidence  risk factors  and prognosis of AKI and thus provide a broader understanding of this complication in a group of patients not specifically reported upon to date All adult patients   years of age admitted to the Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center with COVID  infection from March   through April     were studied in this retrospective analysis done in a single medical center serving a low income minority population in Brooklyn  NY 
It was one of the single centers with the most admissions of COVID  patients 
COVID  infection was diagnosed based on clinical presentation  radiographic lung abnormalities  and a positive result of real time PCR 
We excluded COVID  patients from our study if they were on maintenance hemodialysis or were renal transplant recipients 
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Brookdale Hospital and did not require patient consent because of its retrospective design We collected the demographics  the presenting clinical symptoms when available  prior medical history including outpatient medications and prior level of renal function  comorbidities  and in hospital laboratory data from the electronic medical record  Epic Hyperspace   
Laboratory data consisted of complete blood count  hemostasis parameters  renal and liver function  PF ratio  arterial oxygen partial pressure  PaO  fractional inspired oxygen  FiO   creatinine kinase  lactate dehydrogenase  and inflammatory markers including high sensitivity C reactive protein  hs CRP  ferritin  and D dimer 
Normal range of these measures was provided by our laboratory The Kidney Disease  Improving Global Outcome  KDIGO    definition was used to identify AKI 
Estimated glomerular filtration rate  eGFR  on admission was taken as baseline eGFR and was divided into   and ≥  mL min  m 
eGFR was estimated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study  MDRD  equation 
The earliest day of the serum creatinine change that met the KDIGO criteria for AKI was selected as day   of AKI 
The peak serum creatinine value was used to determine the stage of AKI  with an increase in the serum creatinine of  –   –  and   times the baseline serum creatinine defined as AKI stages     and   respectively Continuous variables were described as mean   standard deviation for normally distributed data  or median and interquartile range  IQR  values for non normal distribution 
Categorical variables were presented as frequency and percentage 
The mean of continuous variables was compared by using independent t tests  the Wilcoxon rank sum test  and the Kruskal Wallis test  across the stages of AKI 
The proportion of categorical variables was compared by using χ  test 
Fischer s exact test was used when there were only limited data available 
The Kaplan Meier method  log rank test  was used to determine the cumulative incidence of in hospital mortality 
We used the Cox proportional hazard  PH  regression to determine the association of kidney disease indicators and in hospital mortality 
The assumptions of the Cox PH model were checked using the Schoenfeld residuals  and no violations of the assumptions were present 
In the multivariable analysis  separate Cox PH models were used to determine the association of baseline eGFR and blood urea nitrogen  BUN  on admission  proteinuria  hematuria  and stages of AKI with in hospital mortality since these variables showed a highly significant correlation 
Variables for Cox PH regression were selected using stepwise regression 
Variables with α level of risk factor   were entered into the model 
While evaluating the association of hematuria and proteinuria with in hospital mortality by the Cox PH model  patients with missing values  n     were excluded from the analysis 
All statistical analyses were performed using the STATA version   software and a p value of   was used to determine statistical significance In this study    adult confirmed cases of COVID  were initially reviewed 
Patients on maintenance hemodialysis  n     were excluded from the study and   patients were used for the analysis

There was no significant association between in hospital mortality and proteinuria and or hematuria  Table  AKI is common among hospitalized patients  incidence  –  and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality       
In our cohort of   COVID  patients  a relatively higher percentage of patients     of   developed in hospital AKI 
Current evidence suggests that AKI in COVID  patients is a result of an interplay of virus mediated injury  a dysregulated inflammatory response  angiotensin II pathway activation  hypercoagulation  and microangiopathy   
These COVID specific factors likely interact with the other known risk factors for AKI  such as hemodynamic instability  hypoxia  and sepsis  which increased over time 
The increase in the cumulative incidence of AKI over time in our cohort is likely associated with concomitant clinical deterioration and less likely represent a unique renal effect of COVID 
Compared to studies of AKI in COVID  patients from other countries  we found our incidence to be higher than that reported from   Asian countries  –  and is similar to that in an Italian study             
However  it is lower than that in the more recent report by Hirsch et al 
  who detailed their experience in   academic and community hospitals in metropolitan New York   none of which are located in the inner city  lower socioeconomic neighborhoods with a predominant minority population 
As compared with the above cited studies  the incidence of stage   AKI   was highest in our cohort 
It is not possible to determine with certainty the cause s  of this wide variation 
However  we did note a higher prevalence of comorbid conditions in our group 
For example  Cheng et al 
  reported a   incidence of AKI  with a   prevalence of HTN and a   prevalence of DM in their study population 
In our cohort  roughly twice as many   had HTN  and more than   times as many   were diabetic  Table  
Also  the incidence of severe lung involvement that required mechanical ventilation was lower   than ours    Table  
Mechanical ventilation per se has been reported to be strongly associated with AKI   
In our cohort  the incidence of AKI was also higher among those requiring mechanical ventilation  We identified various risk factors for AKI in our study  Tables    
Similar to previous reports  our patients with AKI were more likely to be male  have a history of HTN  and have severe respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation     
In our study  higher BMI increased the likelihood of developing severe AKI 
A low eGFR at presentation more than doubled the risk of developing AKI  p      Table  
Patients with lower eGFR had a significantly higher cumulative incidence of AKI than those with eGFR   mL min  m   p     Fig 
 
Thus  there was a synergistic effect of reduced baseline kidney function and subsequent AKI 
We did not find an association between diabetes and in hospital AKI The role of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors  ACEi  in COVID  is a subject of ongoing debate 
ACEi can increase the expression of ACE  the receptor used by SARS CoV  to enter target cells     
However  ACE  has been shown to be beneficial in acute respiratory distress syndrome when replaced     
This possible protective effect is attributed to the degradation of proinflammatory angiotensin II to angiotensin by ACE 
At present  it remains unclear if ACEi facilitate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus    SARS CoV  cellular entry and intracellular virus replication and whether ACEi improve acute respiratory distress syndrome outcomes 
In our cohort  the use of ACEi was significantly higher in patients with a lower admitting eGFR  Table   and in those who experienced AKI  Table  
We found a similar association between AKI and non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs  but not with angiotensin II receptor blockers  ARBs  in our cohort  Table  
Further studies are necessary to delineate the relationship between ACEi  angiotensin II receptor blockers  and COVID  outcomes Markers of acute inflammation  ferritin and CRP  muscle injury  creatinine kinase  myocardial injury  and D dimer levels were significantly higher in patients with a low eGFR at presentation  online suppl 
Table   and in those with AKI  online suppl 
Table   suggesting causality by a dysregulated immune inflammatory response  the so called  cytokine storm We found an extremely high incidence of mortality in our study cohort 
High presenting BUN and low eGFR   mL min  m  were significantly associated with increased mortality  Table  
AKI was significantly associated with increased mortality 
The mortality risk was highest in stage   AKI  HR   CI  –   Table  
Mortality was   in the AKI group and   in the non AKI group  p    
Mortality rose concurrently with the AKI stages      and   for stages     and   respectively  Table  
These rates were over   and  fold higher than those reported by Hirsch et al 
    AKI    in non AKI 
However  our cohort s high mortality is similar to the findings of John Hopkins University and the American Community Survey 
They reported a   and  fold higher COVID  infection and mortality rate in predominantly African American counties than in predominantly white counties   
Wadhera et al 
  also reported a death rate of   per   in Brooklyn  about   higher than that of Manhattan 
Moreover  in New York City  current age adjusted mortality is highest among African Americans and about   times that of whites   Our hospital provides medical services for an ethnic minority and a low income population in the most impoverished neighborhood in Brooklyn  where   of the residents live below the Federal Poverty Level as per a   report   
  of our patients identified themselves as African Americans 
In comparison  in the study by Hirsch et al 
     identified themselves as whites  and only   identified themselves as African Americans 
The high representation of ethnic minorities in our study population may have contributed to the increased mortality 
This association has been widely publicized and is likely the result of a complex interplay of multiple factors 
These include  but are not limited to  a high burden of comorbidities  genetics  the pernicious influence of adverse socioeconomic determinants of health  the absence of the privilege to work from home  and the ability to follow the recommended social distancing   In our cohort      of the   patients with AKI required RRT 
Nineteen out of these   patients   were mechanically ventilated 
Thus  almost all of the additional requirements for acute dialysis during the COVID  pandemic at our institution were in intensive care units 
Overall      out of   of mechanically ventilated patients required RRT 
Elevated ferritin was associated with an increased risk of all stages of AKI and the need for RRT  online suppl 
Table  
Among those who received RRT      died versus     in the stage   AKI group who did not undergo RRT  p      Table  
Thus  there was no statistically significant improvement in survival  and the mortality remained extremely high in both the RRT and non RRT groups 
These findings should prompt the early involvement of a palliative care team to define goals of care in patients with COVID  disease and stage   AKI In our experience  ultrafiltration was not well tolerated 
It often increased pressor requirements and did little to improve the ventilatory status 
We observed a high incidence of hypercoagulability and frequent clotting of the dialysis filters  lines  and catheters 
Thus  the patients required higher than the usual doses of heparin Our study has limitations 
Although     of the study population had a low eGFR on admission  only     had a documented history of CKD 
Data were collected retrospectively from medical records and often did not have information regarding prior renal function 
Patients also may have had an elevated creatinine on admission secondary to AKI suffered prior to hospitalization 
If so  we may have underestimated the true overall incidence of COVID associated AKI 
It is not possible to rectify this problem  given the data at our disposal Our study is a single center study  with the majority of the study population identifying themselves as African Americans or Hispanics 
This limits our study s general applicability but provides a unique insight into this population and broadens our understanding of COVID  disease 
Data were missing on many patients at different stages of the hospitalization since they were collected retrospectively 
Importantly  little data were available regarding urine output  a defining characteristic of AKI 
With this lack of information  we may have again underestimated the true incidence of AKI Nevertheless  even with the above limitations of our study  the high incidence of AKI and its negative impact upon survival is abundantly clear 
In response to the high incidence of AKI in our patients with COVID  we increased our capacity to deliver RRT 
These efforts included the purchase of additional machines and dialysis solutions  additional staff training  and engineering alterations to allow dialysis on the general medical floors 
Also  we increased our stockpiles of catheters  filters  and dialysis solutions for intermittent and continuous RRT 
We also plan to establish a peritoneal dialysis program to further strengthen our acute dialysis capacity In conclusion  our data report explicitly upon a high proportion of ethnic minority patients in an inner city  severely economically deprived neighborhood  previously not studied 
Our patients experienced a high incidence of AKI and an extremely high mortality  especially in AKI stage  
Unfortunately  RRT provided little survival benefit

  supervisor Recombination Every Day  Abundant Recombination in a Virus during a Single Multi Cellular Host InfectionAs increasing numbers of full length viral sequences become available  recombinant or mosaic viruses are being recognized more frequently   
Recombination events have been demonstrated to be associated with viruses expanding their host range   or increasing their virulence    thus accompanying  or perhaps even being at the origin of  major changes during virus adaptation 
It remains unclear  however  whether recombination events represent a highly frequent and significant phenomenon in the everyday life of these viruses Viruses can exchange genetic material when at least two different viral genomes co infect the same host cell 
Progeny can then become hybrid through different mechanisms  such as reassortment of segments when the parental genomes are fragmented    intra molecular recombination when polymerases switch templates  in RNA viruses     or homologous or non homologous recombination  in both RNA and DNA viruses 
Quantification of viral recombination in multi cellular organisms has been attempted under two distinct experimental approaches  in vitro  in cell cultures     and in vivo  in live hosts    
The in vitro approach  which has so far been applied only to animal viruses  allows the establishment of the  intrinsic  recombination rate in experimentally co infected cells in cell cultures   
However  it does not necessarily reflect the situation in entire  living hosts  where the frequency of co infected cells is poorly known and depends on many factors such as the size of the pathogen population  the relative frequency and distribution of the different variants  and host defense mechanisms preventing secondary infection of cells 
The in vivo experimental approach is closer to biological conditions and may thus be more informative of what actually happens in  the real world However  as discussed below  numerous experimental constraints have so far precluded an actual quantification of the baseline rate of recombination 
First  many experimental designs have used extreme positive selection  where only recombinant genomes were viable  e g    
Other studies did not use complementation techniques but detected recombinants by PCR within infected hosts or tissues    which provides information on their presence but not on their frequency in the viral population 
So far  no quantitative PCR or other quantitative method has been applied to evaluate the number of recombinants appearing in an experimentally infected live host 
Finally  recent methods based on sequence analysis inferred the population recombination rate  rather than the individual recombination rate   
While results from these methods certainly take in vivo recombination into account  there are other caveats  isolates have often been collected in different hosts sometimes in different geographical regions and sometimes the selective neutrality of sequence variation on which these estimates are based is not clearly established 
Estimates from such studies by essence address the estimation of the recombination rate at a different evolutionary scale Taken together  the currently available information indicates that no viral recombination rate has ever been estimated directly at time and space scales corresponding to a single multi cellular host infection  although this level is most significant for the biology and evolution of viruses 
This study intends to fill this gap by evaluating the recombination frequency of the cauliflower mosaic virus  CaMV  during a single passage in one of its host plants  the turnip Brassica rapa CaMV is a pararetrovirus  which is a major grouping containing hepadnaviruses  e g  hepatitis B virus  badnaviruses  e g  banana streak virus  and caulimoviruses  e g  CaMV 
Pararetroviruses are characterized by a non segmented double stranded DNA genome 
After entering the host cell nucleus  the viral DNA accumulates as a minichromosome   whose transcription is ensured by the host RNA polymerase II   
The CaMV genome consists in approximately   bp and encodes six viral gene products that have been detected in planta  Figure     
Viral proteins P  to P  are expressed from two major transcripts  namely a  S RNA  encoding P  and a  S RNA corresponding to the entire genome and serving as mRNA for proteins P –P    
Using the pre genomic  S RNA as a matrix  the protein P   product of gene V  reverse transcribes the genome into genomic DNA that is concomitantly encapsidated   The detection of CaMV recombinants in turnip hosts has been reported numerous times 
Some studies have demonstrated the appearance of infectious recombinant viral genomes after inoculation  i  of a host plant with two infectious or non infectious parental clones   or  ii  of a transgenic plant containing one CaMV transgene with a CaMV genome missing the corresponding genomic region   
While the former revealed inter genomic viral recombination  the latter demonstrated that CaMV can also recombine with transgenes within the host s genome 
Another study based on phylogenetic analyses of various CaMV strains has clearly suggested different origins for different genomic regions and  hence  multiple recombination events during the evolution of this virus   
Indirect experimental evidence has indicated that  in some cases  CaMV recombination could occur within the host nucleus  between different viral minichromosomes  presumably through the action of the DNA repair cellular machinery   
Nevertheless  the mechanism of  template switching  during reverse transcription  predominant in all retroviruses  most certainly also applies to pararetroviruses 
For this reason  and on the basis of numerous experimental data  CaMV is generally believed to recombine mostly in the cytoplasm of the host cell  by  legal  template switching between two pre genomic RNA molecules    or  illegal  template switching between the  S and the  S RNA   
Under this hypothesis  recombination in CaMV could therefore be considered as operating on a linear template during reverse transcription  with the  ′ and  ′ extremities later ligated to circularize the genomic DNA  position   in Figure  
The above cited studies clearly demonstrate that CaMV is able to recombine 
However  since these studies are based on complementation techniques  non quantitative detection  or phylogenetically based inferences of recombination  they do not inform us on whether recombination is an exceptional event or an  everyday  process shaping the genetic composition of CaMV populations In the present work  we aimed at answering this question 
To this end  we have constructed a CaMV genome with four genetic markers  demonstrated to be neutral in competition experiments 
By co inoculating host plants with equal amounts of wild type and marker containing CaMV particles  we have generated mixed populations in which impressive proportions of recombinants distributed in several different classes corresponding to exchange of different genomic regions have been detected and quantified 
Altogether  the recombinant genomes averaged over   of the population 
Further analysis of these data  assuming a number of viral replications during the infection period ranging from five to   indicates that the per nucleotide per replication cycle recombination rate of CaMV is of the same order of magnitude  i e  on the order of a few   across the entire genome 
We thereby provide the first quantification  to our knowledge  of the recombination rate in a virus population during a single passage in a single host From Figure   and supposing that all marker containing genomic regions can recombine  we could predict the detection and quantification of seven classes of recombinant genotypes   bcd a  a cd b  ab d c  abc d   cd ab  a d bc  and a c b d 
Indeed  all classes were detected  and their frequencies in the ten CaMV populations analyzed are summarized in Table  Altogether  the proportion of recombinant genomes found in the mixed viral populations was astonishingly high and very similar in the ten co infected plants analyzed  Table   last column  ranging between    plant   to    plants     and   with a mean frequency   standard error  of      
This result indicates that recombination events are very frequent during the invasion of the host plant by CaMV and represents  to our knowledge  the first direct quantification of viral recombination during the infection of a live multi cellular host The inferred per generation recombination and interference rates  assuming that CaMV undergoes ten replication cycles during the   d between infection and sampling  are given for each of the ten plants in Table  
Recombination rates between adjacent markers are large  on the order of   to  
Taking the distance in nucleotides between markers into account yields an average recombination rate per nucleotide and generation on the order of      
Interestingly  this recombination rate does not vary throughout the genome  Kruskal–Wallis test  p    To relax the assumption of the number of replications during the   d  we calculated the recombination parameters assuming five or   generations 
The effect of the number of generations on the estimates is linear  doubling the number of generations results in a halving of the recombination rate  detailed results not shown 
For example  the average recombination rates r
  r
  and r
  assuming   generations were equal to     and   respectively  compare with values in Table   yielding per nucleotide per generation recombination rates of             and      Inspection of Table   also shows that first order interference coefficients were in general negative  indicating that a crossing over in one genomic segment increases the probability that a crossing over will occur in another genomic segment  while the second order coefficient parameter had an average value close to zero with a large variance 
The mechanism leading to these results will be discussed in the following section One major breakthrough in the work presented here lies in the space and time scales at which the experiments were performed 
Indeed  the processes occurring within the course of a single infection of one multi cellular host are of obvious biological relevance for any disease 
Previous studies on viral recombination suffered from major drawbacks in this respect  basing their conclusions on experiments relying on complementation among non infectious viruses or between viruses with undetermined relative fitness  on phylogenetically based analyses  or on experiments in cell cultures 
For reasons detailed in the Introduction  the first two methods either do not provide information on the frequency of recombination  but only its occurrence  or address the question at a different temporal  and often spatial  scale 
Results from cell cultures  on the other hand  impose cell co infection by different viral variants  potentially overestimating the frequency of recombination events 
Our study circumvents these limitations by analyzing viral genotypes sampled from infected plants after the course of a single infection  and therefore the invasion and co infection of cells in various organs and tissues is very close to natural More than half of the genomes       see Table   present in a CaMV population after a single passage in its host plant were identified as recombinants  and these data allowed us to infer a per nucleotide per generation recombination rate on the order of       to      
The time length of one generation  i e  the time required for a given genome to go from one replication to the next  is totally unknown in plant viruses 
The only experimental data available on CaMV are based on the kinetics of gene expression in infected protoplasts  where the capsid protein is produced between   and   h   
The reverse transcription and the encapsidation of genomic DNA being two coupled phenomena    we judged it reasonable to assume a generation time of   d and  thus  an average of ten generations during our experiments 
In case this estimate is mistaken  we have verified a linear relationship between r and the number of generations  thereby allowing an immediate adjustment of r if the CaMV generation time is more precisely established 
At this point  we must consider that all cloned genomes may not have been through all the successive replication events potentially allowed by the timing of our experiments 
It was previously shown that about   of CaMV mature virus particles accumulate in compact inclusion bodies    where they may be sequestered for a long time  as such inclusions are very frequent in all infected cells  including those in leaves that have been invaded by the virus population for several weeks 
The viral population may thus present an age structure that could bias the estimation of the recombination rate 
In order to minimize this bias  the clones we analyzed were collected in one young newly formed leaf  where the chances of finding genomes from  unsequestered lines  were assumed to be higher 
In any case  our data analysis is conservative  since this age structure can only lead to an underestimation of the recombination rate Our results show that interferences between pairs of loci are negative  a recombination event between two loci apparently increases the probability of recombination between another pair of loci 
We believe that the most parsimonious explanation of these negative interferences is based on the way the infection builds up within plant hosts 
Indeed  one can divide infected host cells into those infected by a single virus genotype and those infected by more than one viral genotype 
In the former  analogous to clonal propagation  recombination is undetectable 
In the latter  recombination is not only detectable but  as our results indicate  very frequent 
Samples consisting of viruses resulting from a mixture of these two types of host cell infections will thus contain viruses with no recombination and viruses with several recombination events  thus yielding an impression of negative interference 
These conceptual arguments are supported by mathematical models 
It is indeed easy to show  detailed results not shown  that if a proportion F of the population reproduces clonally  analogous to single infections  while the remaining reproduces panmictically  negative interferences could be inferred even if they do not exist 
For example  assuming a three locus model with real recombination rates r
  and r
  and interference i
  the  apparent  recombination and interference parameters  would be r
        F r  r
        F r
  and i
     F   i
    F 
Interestingly  this example also shows that our estimates of the recombination rate are conservative  that a fraction F of host cells are singly infected while others are multiply infected leads to an underestimation of the recombination rate As judged by r
  r
  and r
  calculated between markers a–b  b–c  and c–d  respectively  we found evidence for recombination through the entire CaMV genome 
The values for r
 
r
  and r
  are remarkably similar  hence the recombination sites seem to be evenly distributed along the genome 
We considered the template switching model as the major way recombinants are created in CaMV 
As already mentioned in the Introduction  hot spots of template switching have been predicted at the position of the  ′ extremities of the  S and  S RNAs   
If other recombination mechanisms  such as that associated with second strand DNA synthesis or with the host cell DNA repair machinery  act significantly  hot spots would be expected at the positions of the sequence interruption     and     
Due to the design of our experiment and the position of the four markers  we have no information on putative hot spots at positions corresponding to the  ′ end of the  S RNA and to    at nucleotide position  
Nevertheless  the putative hot spots at the  ′ end of the  S RNA and at   and    nucleotide positions   and   respectively  fall between marker pairs c–d  b–c  and a–b  respectively 
Our results indicate that either these hot spots are quantitatively equivalent though predicted by different recombination mechanisms or  more likely  that they simply do not exist 
Whatever the explanation  what we observe is that the CaMV can exchange any portion of its genome  and thus any gene thereof  with an astonishingly high frequency during the course of a single host infection To our knowledge  the viral recombination rate has never previously been quantified experimentally for a plant virus   
In contrast  retroviruses and particularly HIV  have been extensively investigated in that sense 
As we have already discussed for these latter cases  the quantification of the intrinsic recombination rate was carried out in artificially co infected cell cultures 
The estimated intrinsic per nucleotide per generation recombination rate in HIV  is on the order of      less than one order of magnitude higher than our estimation for CaMV 
Because for various reasons detailed above we probably underestimate the within host CaMV recombination rate  we believe that the intrinsic recombination rate in CaMV is higher and perhaps on the order of that of HIV Other pararetroviruses such as plant badnaviruses or vertebrate hepadnaviruses have a similar cycle within their host cells  including steps of nuclear minichromosome  genomic size RNA synthesis  and reverse transcription and encapsidation 
Nevertheless  vertebrate hepadnaviruses  e g  hepatitis B virus  infect hosts that are very different from plants in their biology and physiology  and this could lead to a totally different frequency of cell co infection during the development of the virus populations 
Thus  even though our results can be informative for other pararetroviruses because of the viruses  shared biological characteristics  they should not be extrapolated to vertebrate pararetroviruses without caution We used the plasmid pCa  which is the complete genome of the CaMV isolate Cabb S  cloned into the pBR  plasmid at the unique SalI restriction site   
To analyze recombination in different regions of the genome  we introduced four genetic markers  a  b  c  and d  at the positions       and   respectively  thus approximately at four cardinal points of the CaMV circular double stranded DNA of   bp  Figure  
All markers  each corresponding to a single nucleotide change  were introduced by PCR directed mutagenesis in pCa  and resulted in the duplication of previously unique restriction sites BsiWI  PstI  MluI  and SacI in a plasmid designated pMark S  Because  in this study  we targeted the possible exchange of genes between viral genomes  all markers a  b  c  and d were introduced within coding regions corresponding to open reading frames I  IV  V  and VI  respectively 
Another important concern was to quantify recombination in the absence of selection  i e  to create neutral markers 
Consequently all markers consist of synonymous mutations  see below To generate the parental virus particles  plasmids pCa  and pMark S were mechanically inoculated into individual plants as previously described   
All plants were turnips  B  rapa cv   Just Right  grown under glasshouse conditions at   °C with a    light dark  photoperiod 
Thirty days post inoculation  all symptomatic leaves were harvested and viral particles were purified as described earlier   The resulting preparations of parental viruses  designated Cabb S and Mark S  were quantified by spectrometry using the formula described by Hull et al 
  
We fixed the initial frequency of markers to a value of   and a solution containing   mg ml of virus particles of both Cabb S and Mark S at a   ratio was prepared 
Plantlets were co infected by mechanical inoculation of two to three leaves with   μl of this virus solution  using abrasive Celite AFA  Fluka  Ronkonkoma  New York  United States 
The mixed CaMV population was allowed to grow during   d of systemic infection We designed an experimental protocol for quantifying marker frequency within a mixed Cabb S Mark S virus population after a single passage in a host plant 
Twenty four individual plants  inoculated as above with equal amounts of Cabb S and Mark S  were harvested   d post inoculation  when symptoms were fully developed 
The viral DNA was purified from   mg of young newly formed infected leaves according to the protocol described previously   
After the precipitation step of this protocol  the viral DNA was resuspended and further purified with the Wizard DNA clean up kit  Promega  Fitchburg  Wisconsin  United States  in TE  X   mM Tris HCl and   mM EDTA  pH   
Aliquots of viral DNA preparations were digested by restriction enzymes corresponding either to marker a  b  c  or d and submitted to a   agarose gel electrophoresis  colored by ethydium bromide and exposed to UV 
Each individual restriction enzyme cut once in Cabb S DNA and twice in Mark S  thus generating DNA fragments of different sizes attributable to one or the other in the mixed population of CaMV genomes 
After scanning the agarose gels  we estimated the relative frequency of the two genotypes in each viral DNA preparation and at each marker position  by densitometry using the NIH   Image program 
The statistical analyses of the frequency of the four markers are described below To identify and quantify the recombinants within the CaMV mixed populations  aliquots from ten of the   viral DNA preparations described above were digested by the restriction enzyme SalI  and directly cloned into pUC  at the corresponding site 
In each of the ten viral populations analyzed    full genome length clones were digested separately by BsiWI  PstI  MluI  and SacI  to test for the presence of marker a  b  c  and d  respectively 
In this experiment  with the marker representing an additional restriction site  we could easily distinguish between the Cabb S and the Mark S genotype at all four marker positions  upon agarose gel   electrophoresis of the digested clones 
Clones with none or all four markers were parental genotypes  whereas clones harboring     or   markers were clearly recombinants 
Due to the very high number of recombinants detected  markers eventually appearing or disappearing due to spontaneous mutations were neglected Here we present the different methods we used to quantify recombination in the CaMV genome 
Because all these methods assume that the different markers are neutral  we first discuss assumption We used two datasets to test the neutrality of markers  both resulting from plants co infected with a   ratio of Mark S and Cabb S 
The first consisted of viral DNA densitometry data derived from   plants  described above  where for each plant we have an estimate of the frequency of each marker in the genome population 
The second consisted of the restriction of   individual full genome length viral clones obtained from one co infected plant  described above  yielding an estimate of the frequency of each marker  and this was repeated on ten different plants 
The frequencies of the different markers were       and   for markers a  b  c  and d in the first dataset and       and   in the second dataset 
We tested whether these frequencies were significantly different from the expected value under neutrality    using either t tests  for datasets where normality could not be rejected  seven out of eight cases  or Wilcoxon signed rank non parametric tests otherwise  marker c in the first dataset 
In all cases p values were larger than  There are several cautionary remarks regarding these analyses 
First  in all cases we found an excess of markers 
Unfortunately  the two datasets cannot be regarded as independent because  even though the methods through which the frequency estimates were obtained were different  the plants used in the second dataset were a subset of the plants of the first 
We thus have only four independent estimates in each case  and there is minimal power to detect significant deviations from neutrality with such a small sample size 
It should be noted at this stage that deviations from the expected value could also be caused either by slight deviations from the   ratio in the infecting mixed solution  or by deviations from that ratio in the frequency of the viral particles that actually get into the plants 
Second  because of the relatively small sample sizes and low statistical power  the tests presented above could have detected only large deviations The results clearly show  however  precisely that the markers do not have large effects  if any  and that therefore recombination estimates would be affected only very slightly by any hypothetical selective effects of the markers 
Because of this  along with the fact that the introduced markers provoke silent substitutions in the CaMV genome  we assumed that markers were effectively neutral in the rest of the analysis The dataset used to estimate the recombination frequency consisted of the   full genome length viral clones   from each of ten co infected plants  individually genotyped for each of the four markers 
As discussed in detail in the Results  recombination was very frequent and concerned all four markers 
Indeed  approximately half of the genotyped clones exhibited a recombinant genotype 
It was therefore meaningful to try to obtain quantitative estimates of recombination from our data Our aim was to analyze viral recombination in a live host 
Consequently  we had to deal with the fact that more than one viral replication cycle occurred during the   d that infection lasted in our experiment  we had to wait that long for the disease to develop and to be able to recover sufficient amounts of viral DNA from each infection 
Based on the kinetics of gene expression    we postulate that each replication cycle lasts between   and   d  and that therefore seven to ten cycles occurred between infection and the sampling time 
In case this assumption is incorrect  we did calculations assuming five  seven  ten  or   replication cycles during these   d  As shown  the results were not affected qualitatively  and only slightly quantitatively 
It is important to note that we assumed that recombination occurred through a template switching mechanism  and that therefore  from a recombination point of view  the CaMV genome is linear 
The reverse transcription starts and finishes at the position   in Figure   which is the point of circularization of the DNA genome 
This implies that changes between contiguous markers a–b  b–c  and c–d can be considered as true recombination whereas those between a and d cannot  as they may simply stem from circularization of DNA  during the synthesis of which the polymerase has switched template once anywhere between a–b  b–c  or c–d To estimate the recombination rate between markers  we wrote recurrence equations describing the change in frequency of each genotype over one generation  assuming random mating and no selection  i e  the standard Wright–Fisher population genetics model 
We then expressed the frequency of all possible genotypes n generations later as a function of their initial frequency and of the recombination parameters 
Subsequently we calculated the maximum likelihood estimates of the recombination parameters and their asymptotic variances given initial frequencies  we assumed that the two  parental  genotypes  Mark S and Cabb S  had equal initial frequencies of   and that all other genotypes had initial frequencies of zero  and frequencies after n generations  the observed frequencies  as stated above we used different values of n 
All algebraic and numerical calculations were carried out with the software Mathematica The recombination parameters are the recombination rates between two adjacent loci  e g  r
  for the recombination rate between markers a and b  and the interference coefficients  e g  i
  for interference between recombination events in the segments between markers a and b and b and c  To define these parameters we followed Christiansen    and in particular the recombination distributions for two  three  and four loci  respectively  Tables     and   of   
It is important to realize that given the definitions of these parameters  the estimator of the recombination rate between two loci is not affected by the number of loci considered 
In other words  we obtain the same estimation of the recombination rate between markers a and b whether we consider genotypic frequencies at just these two loci  or the frequencies at these two loci plus a third locus  or the complete information to which we have access  the four marker genotypes 
Information on additional loci only affects the estimates of the interference coefficients It proved impossible to carry out the calculations for four loci algebraically 
Instead  we used a computer program to calculate the expected genotypic frequencies at all four loci after n generations  given the above stated initial frequencies and specified recombination parameters 
For each combination of recombination parameters we calculated a Euclidean distance between the vector of the expected genotypic frequencies and the observed genotypic frequencies  and considered that the estimated recombination parameters were those yielding the minimal Euclidean distance 
In all cases  the estimated recombination rates between pairs of loci were equal to the second decimal to those estimated algebraically from data for three or two loci Tumor Restrictions to Oncolytic VirusIn most solid tumors the tumor interior displays a high cellular density with multiple cell types  both malignant and normal  stromal  cells  interdigitated by strands of extracellular matrix  ECM  and other poorly defined tissue 
Stromal cells typically consist of fibroblasts  macrophages  neutrophils and other immune cell types 
Tumor associated fibroblasts are a source of the bulk acellular tissue in tumors    which is largely made up of polysugars and glycoproteins  such as collagens  laminins  fibronectins  proteoglycans  hyaluronan and water  forming a dense matrix around and between the cancer cells   
This matrix provides structural support but also haptotactic and chemotactic guidance for cancer cells   
Moreover  the prevailing tumor interstitium is rich in soluble angiogenic factors  such as members of the vascular endothelial growth factor  VEGF  family    cellular growth factors  including endothelial growth factor  EGF  basic fibroblast growth factor  FGF  platelet derived growth factor  PDGF  and pleiotrophic factors  particularly transforming growth factor  TGF  beta   
Additionally  both tumor  and stromal cells secrete cytokines and chemokines  such as interleukin  IL    IL   tumor necrosis factor  TNF  alpha  stromal cell derived factor  SDF    macrophage migration inhibitory factor  MIF    which on one hand recruit more stromal and progenitor cells into the tumors and on the other hand curb the activity of antigen presenting cells and anti tumor T cells   
In several independent cancer types  high serum levels of IL   and IL   are indicators of poor prognosis   Aberrant tumor and stromal growth combined with an overproduction of matrix leads to high interstitial pressure in the tumor  preventing lateral diffusion of therapeutic compounds within the tumor 
Tight cellular compactness combined with a high tumor proliferation rate also causes physical crowding and puts constraints on oxygenation  which due to aberrant angiogenesis and rupture of the haphazard vessels is mostly incomplete and results in chronic tissue hypoxia toward the tumor cores 
As cancer cells exist in a crowding hypoxic  and cytokine growth factor perpetuated chronic state of stress  they upregulate a number of key cellular molecules that function as a collective defense against a wide range of therapies  including oncolytic viruses 
The properties of oncolytic viruses and their status in clinical development as well as various delivery options have been reviewed elsewhere   
In this review  we provide an overview of two of the main intratumoral barriers to oncolytic virus spread  the extracellular tumor make up and the intracellular antiviral defense mechanisms Tumor cellular structure and composition may in concert with abundant extracellular matrix  ECM  deposition pose a severe hurdle for systemic virus entry and propagation of infection within the tumor 
The extracellular matrix is a complex dense network consisting of multiple proteins  glycoproteins and polysaccharides including collagens  laminins  fibronectins  proteoglycans and hyaluronic acid   
The interstitial fluid pressure  IFP  in the tumor surrounding blood and lymphatic vessels is mainly created by the high cell density that forms an increased physical pressure outwards and does not allow free diffusion of therapeutics   
A high IFP generally predicts an aggressive tumor phenotype as tumor cells tend to escape from tumor margins where the pressure drops  thus facilitating spread of metastatic cells   
On the other hand  for therapeutic virus  interstitial fluid concentration gradients may pose a hurdle as passive diffusion in viable regions  typically the rim  may occur mainly outward   
Given the limited arsenal of known chemicals alleviating tumor compactness and the poor penetration drugs in general into the tumor tissue  this is a considerable problem that may not be easy to tackle 
Some strategies are discussed below Viruses are passive particles and rely either on radial cell to cell spread or on soluble diffusion across concentration gradients to reach their target cells and to propagate the infection 
Tumor matrix is critical in this regard  as it can block both forms of spread 
Passively diffusing viruses may physically not fit through the strands of the ECM 
This was shown for oncolytic herpes virus  which has an outer diameter of over   nm  and whose spreading could be improved by matrix degrading bacterial collagenase co injection   
Bilbao and coworkers showed that adenovirus entry into experimental hepatocellular carcinoma nodules in the livers of immunocompetent rats following intravenous or intraportal injection was directly related to the thickness of the ECM capsule enveloping the nodules   
On the other hand  we found using Semliki Forest virus  which has an outer diameter of about   nm  that even upon intratumoral injection spread was blocked by ECM  which formed a physical barrier for virus infection  Figure  The foremost option to reduce interstitial fluid pressure and to remove physical molecule barriers imposed by the ECM is to use matrix degrading enzymes 
These act by digesting collagen  fibrin  and other types of fibrillar matrix deposits  creating more space between cell clusters  and glycosaminoglycan polymers  known to limit fluid movement in tumors 
Simultaneously  such strategies may also expose more cell surface to viruses  increasing the likelihood of infection 
In a study by Kuriyama  trypsin or collagenase dispase was injected into subcutaneous U  and U  glioma xenografts in immunocompromised mice  followed by a reporter adenovirus   
Both types of ECM degrading enzymes increased tumor transduction by the virus  but when doses got too high  transduction efficacy suffered  demonstrating a balance between ECM degradation and oncolytic virus efficacy 
In another study  treatment of PC  tumors with vaccinia virus producing matrix metalloprotease  MMP    resulted in reduction of collagen IV fibrils and increase in virus penetration into tumor  which yielded elevated virus titers   
Hong et al 
targeted orthotopic neuroblastoma xenografts engineered to express MMP  with oncolytic HSV  achieving increased virus distribution compared to control tumors   
Similar results were obtained when human soft tissue sarcoma HSTS T overexpressing MMP  or MMP  were injected with oncolytic HSV   
MMP expressing tumors contained significantly less sulfated glycosaminoglycans compared to control tumors 
Other enzymes and protein effectors  either engineered into virus expression cassettes or provided exogenously  include hyaluronidase  decorin  various other MMPs  and notably relaxin a peptide hormone normally expressed during particular phase of pregnancy that does not possess tissue degrading activity itself  but instead induces a number of key collagen degrading proteases seemingly in a tumor specific manner   
Beyer showed that relaxin expressed by murine stem cells improved trastuzumab penetrance and therapy outcome in syngeneic tumor models   
In another study  chimeric adenovirus Ad  expressing relaxin showed increased tumor transduction and virus dissemination   Several other strategies to increase penetration of therapeutics in tumors have been developed   
While the stromal ECM capsule of tumor nodules acts as a physical barrier to virus entry following intravenous injection  it was possible to improve tumor infection by administering vaso active compounds  angiotensin II  histamine  nitroglycerine  before the virus   
This is interesting  as vasculature per se would not be expected to alter or influence the physical composition of the ECM  such as collagen strand thickness 
Instead  virus access to the tumor was improved  most likely by increased access from the blood via tumor stromal adjoining vessels 
Interestingly  in a study with oncolytic herpes virus  anti VEGF monoclonal antibody Bevacizumab given before intravenous virus injection gave poorer anti tumor efficacy than when given after the virus   
The study showed that while HSV is able to enter and infect tumors better through their leaky vasculature compared to Bevacizumab normalized vasculature  vascular normalization by Bevacizumab still gave superior combination efficacy when the virus was already in the tumor 
This effect was likely dependent on altering both physical and biological properties of the tumor  including interstitial pressure and oxygenation 
In another study  anti VEGF A antibody injections in nude mice harboring U  human glioma xenografts led to an increase in MMP  expression and reduction in collagen fiber content  facilitating improved distribution of oncolytic adenovirus within the tumor tissue   
In general  targeting tumor vasculature by oncolytic viruses and including agents that affect tumor vasculature in combination regimens is gaining interest    and it will be interesting to see more specific studies on how vascular acting agents may affect the physical barriers to oncolytic viruses Some viruses do not need an extracellular step for propagating infection  such as members of the herpes and poxvirus families  and may be able to spread from cell to cell 
For example  HSV  is able to infect neighboring cells via lateral tight junctions in a manner dependent on its glycoproteins E and I   
Vaccinia virus  on the other hand  induces so called actin tails  which are actin filament driven membranous protrusions of the plasma membrane harboring a single virus particle at the outer tip 
These actin tails actively deliver and deposit virus particles onto or even into neighboring cells   
Because lateral spread without an extracellular step may circumvent neutralizing immunity as well as some of the physical obstacles the tumor microenvironment imposes  this ability has been engineered into viruses that normally do not possess it 
A promising strategy is to engineer OVs to express membrane fusogenic genes  MFGs  such as gibbon ape leukemia virus  GALV  glycoprotein  reptilian reovirus p  protein  FAST  or the membrane glycoproteins H and F of measles virus   
Quite intriguingly  expression of several different MFGs by oncolytic adenovirus synergized with chemotherapy in anti tumor efficacy both in vitro and in vivo    suggesting that membrane fusion facilitated lateral spread of also chemotherapeutics  which otherwise would not have occurred in a compact tumor 
The potential limitation of cell to cell dependent spread  however  may be that membrane free physical barriers  such as the ECM  may still pose a barrier to spread 
Also  it is unclear whether MFGs or other mechanisms of lateral spread may assist in reaching distant tumor nests Some other strategies to alleviate matrix imposed restrictions to oncolytic viruses have been discussed elsewhere   Tumors of epithelial origin mostly retain the firm cellular integrity seen in their original adhesive intercellular configuration 
Several viruses use cellular receptors which are located in paracellular tight junctions  which may be problematic in tightly packed tumors   
Adenovirus C group viruses use coxsackie adenovirus receptor  CAR  as their primary entry point  whereas adenovirus B  group members and measles virus Edmonston use CD  complement binding molecule as their cellular receptor   
Adenovirus B  group  serotypes       and   entry occurs using desmoglein   DSG    
Of these  CAR and DSG  are preferentially located within tight junctions and are hidden from virus binding   
Also the complement receptor CD  was ascribed a role in maintenance of epithelial cell integrity by interactions with the E cadherin catenin network   
These observations imply that before reaching the potential entry site on the tumor cell the virus must find its way into the junctional space 
Moreover  it has become increasingly clear that for example glioma tumors traditionally targeted by Ad  serotype adenoviruses often express only low levels of CAR and instead much higher levels of CD    Beyond that tight junctions hide multiple virus receptors  they contain a network of adhesion molecules  including ZO  cadherins  claudins and occludin  which  if perturbed  is associated with more aggressive disease in many types of cancer   
Since tight junctions also contain important receptors that mediate tumor promoting signaling and which have been targeted by monoclonal antibodies  notably Her  it would be highly useful to develop strategies that temporarily loosen the tight junction contacts even at cost of a transient increase in tumor metastatic risk 
One of the most interesting approaches has been to exploit the natural propensity of adenovirus serotype   which as part of its natural life cycle creates dodecahedral particles  PtDd  consisting of viral capsid proteins  penton base and fiber that open tight junctions by binding to and dissolving desmoglein  dimers and reducing E cadherin expression  to develop a specific tight junction opening molecule  JO    
Adenovirus type   uses PtDds to promote its own infection  opening the tight junctions ahead of infection to maximize access to desmoglein 
Analogously  when administered to human tumor xenografts  JO  facilitated penetration of trastuzumab much deeper into the tumor tissue than when the monoclonal antibody was administered on its own   
Moreover  JO  synergized with several chemotherapeutics in solid tumor models   
Backed by our own findings with oncolytic SFV  showing that both extracellular matrix and tumor cell compactness restrict virus spread and oncolytic efficacy  we believe combination approaches that target both tight junctions and extracellular matrix will prove effective in future virotherapy development  Figure  An alternative approach to increasing tumor penetration by oncolytic viruses is to alter tumor cell morphology and status 
Notably  cell death and in particular the type of cell death induced by virus has been shown to affect virus distribution within a tumor mass  in a study by Nagano et al  administration of apoptosis inducing paclitaxel before injecting oncolytic herpes simplex virus increased virus dissemination in the tumor  allowing its diffuse in  tunnels  created by shrinking dying tumor cells   Maintenance of physiological adherence is essential for proper ECM function and for retaining cellular integrity 
Therefore  a potential caveat of using ECM degrading proteolytic enzymes or tight junction openers is the risk of neoplastic cell detachment from the tumor ECM and increased risk of metastasis 
While ECM degradation or tight junction opening may operate innocuously  there is also a chance that loss of E cadherins via proteases or via non specific deregulation of tight junction integrity during ECM modulating therapy could trigger pro tumorigenic Wnt β catenin signaling  possibly driving epithelial to mesenchymal transition   
One study showed that ectopic relaxin expression stimulated MMP expression and enhanced breast cancer invasiveness    whereas another paper found short term relaxin exposure to increase breast cancer cell motility whereas long term expression reduced both motility and cancer invasiveness   
In the context of oncolytic viruses  Lavilla Alonso tested several proteases  including hyaluronidase  relaxin  and macrophage metalloelastase  and showed they all could assist adenovirus entry into tumors  yet  the authors did not detect treatment induced metastases or increase in tumor invasiveness   
Another strategy possibly balancing some of the putative risks of tight junction disruption could be to use Wnt dependent oncolytic viruses   Tumors are invariably fenestrated by host fibroblasts  myeloid cells and other non transformed cells  which driven by cancer induced cues can adopt various reprogrammed phenotypes to promote tumor angiogenesis and growth and to alter tumor responses to therapies   
As most of them normally play a role in immune homeostasis and pathogen sensing  they also respond to and influence oncolytic virus infection of tumors Fulci et al 
reported that injection of oncolytic HSV  directly into glioblastoma tumor parenchyma triggered upregulation of CD  and CD  monocytic markers and rapid clearance of virus  likely executed by infiltrating phagocytic cells   
When clodronate liposomes were used to deplete macrophages in vivo  the authors observed a  fold increase in virus titers in the brain tumors concomitant with an   reduction in peripheral CD  macrophages in animal spleens  suggesting that CD  cells migrate into the tumors upon virus injection and limit overall oncolytic efficacy 
While CD  cells were not reduced by peripheral macrophage depletion  arguing that these cells had been recruited to the tumors before the treatment  they could be eliminated in live glioma slices ex vivo  resulting in a  fold increase in virus replication 
Macrophages may secrete antiviral type I interferon constitutively at very low  subnanomolar  levels   and recently Liu et al 
showed that tumor resident CD  macrophages induced a protective antiviral state in ovarian and breast tumors which led to resistance to oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus  VSV  infection   
Type I IFN signaling  JAK  inhibitor Ruxolitinib reversed the resistance  facilitating VSV replication in the macrophage protected cancer cells 
It is tempting to speculate that tumor resident macrophages also rendered syngeneic GL  and DBT mouse gliomas completely refractory to VA  oncolytic alphavirus  as these cells were quite infectable in vitro and live glioma slices regained their sensitivity to virus within   h  indicating dilution of IFN I   Macrophages or the closely related myeloid suppressor cells are the predominant stromal cell type in many tumors and are actively recruited during cancer progression   
Heavy macrophage presence in the tumors indicates that such tumors may be resistant to oncolytic virotherapy  unless depleting preconditioning would be used 
Moreover  as part of the early immune response to virus infection  monocytic cells are rapidly recruited to tumors following intratumoral virus injection 
In one study  depletion of either CD b  cells or VEGF secreted by these cells in mice treated with oncolytic HSV  greatly increased oncolytic efficacy  tentatively linking pro tumorigenic and antiviral angiogenic mechanisms   Another key pro tumorigenic signaling employed by many tumors is up regulation of CXCR  the receptor for chemokine CXCL   also known as SDF  and recruitment of stromal cells expressing CXCL  which maintain the tumor and recruit additional cells to support tumor expansion and invasion  such as endothelial cell progenitors which contribute to neovascularization   
Indeed  high CXCR  expression is a negative prognostic factor for many cancers 
Oncolytic vaccinia virus engineered to express a soluble antagonist of CXCR  showed improved intratumoral virus replication  increased vascular disruption and a markedly reduced infiltration of the tumors by putative immune suppressive and tumor promoting stromal cells   
This study highlights how reducing pro tumor stromal cell effects may alleviate antiviral resistance and yield increased overall therapeutic efficacy 
On the other hand  if the paracrine antiviral effects of tumor homing monocytic cells could be selectively abrogated these cells could favorably be used to ferry oncolytic viruses into tumors 
Indeed  a significant delay in metastatic tumor potential was achieved when macrophages were harnessed to deliver a tumor specific oncolytic adenovirus   What is the antiviral status in human cancer 
Recent analyses from different normal cells that occupy the same organ reveal striking functional variation in components of the type I IFN signaling pathway that correlate with the tissue tropism and virulence of some virus strains   
Can similar variation in such components be found in cancer cells  or do cancer cells make an exception Transformed cells undergo selective elimination by the immune system before becoming cancerous  termed immunoediting  based on observations of differential capacity of immunocompetent mice to reject tumors previously grown in immunocompromised hosts versus syngeneic animals   
Cancer cell responsiveness to type I and type II IFNs plays a role during immunoediting  cancer cells that eventually progress to form a tumor display reduced capacity to respond to IFN gamma  which otherwise would upregulate MHC class I molecules and render the tumors amenable to CD  T cell mediated destruction  whereas responsiveness to type I interferon initially helps tumors avoid immune purging during the editing phase and is then irrelevant   
Of note  the anti tumor effects of type I IFN  still exploited today in several cancers  were shown to depend on host NK cells  and mice in which IFNAR was blocked by monoclonal antibody failed to reject even highly immunogenic tumors  as opposed to mice treated with control antibody  who all rejected the immunogenic tumor challenge   
Thus  whereas tumor responsiveness to type I IFN is not predetermined after immunoediting  other factors post immunoediting may influence it In several tumor types  varying levels of expression of components of the type I IFN signaling cascade have been detected  and in some tumor types these components have been found to have prognostic value  whereas in others they do not seem to influence survival   
However  emerging data suggests that antiviral genes may predict poor survival because they increase treatment resistance 
In one study  poor prognosis of several types of cancer due to genotoxic treatment resistance was found to correlate with increased activity of IFN I pathway genes   
In this study  a triad of type I IFN signaling pathway genes  STAT  ISG  and IFIT  formed a pan tumor type negative prognostic factor  and a broader seven gene cluster established negative prognostic criteria for treatment resistant breast cancer 
Treatment resistance was subsequently shown to depend on STAT  signaling  STAT expressing tumor clones were positively selected in animals in vivo  demonstrating increased proliferation and metastatic potential  and STAT expression mediated resistance against genotoxic assault by doxorubicin or ionizing radiation  knockdown of STAT  resulted in lower proliferation rate and metastatic capacity and increased sensitivity to genotoxic stress    
In another study  resistance to epigenetic DNA modifiers  AZA dC  a methyltransferase inhibitor  and LBH  or MGCD  both histone deacetylase  HDAC  inhibitors  was correlated with increased expression of IFN I pathway genes in small lung cancer cells   
Basal IFN related gene expression in several different SML cell lines was upregulated Interestingly  in many cancers  STAT proteins are not phosphorylated and persist in unphosphorylated form  U STAT 
Like its phosphorylated counterpart  U STAT  increases expression of genes contributing to resistance to DNA damaging agents   
While it is currently unknown why cancers may prefer to use unphosphorylated forms  it is known that U STATs activate distinct signals compared to their phosphorylated counterparts 
However  importantly for oncolytic viruses  in many tumors  constant expression and release of type I IFN leads to a constitutively high level of unphosphorylated forms of STAT  STAT  and IRF  which together form an unphosphorylated but functional ISGF like complex that relocalizes to the nucleus and drives expression of a specific set of ISGs distinct from acute IFN I exposure   
These ISGs are sufficient to maintain a functional antiviral defense and they play a critical role in resistance to DNA damaging agents On a cellular level  virus replication is controlled by antiviral defense molecules    which in turn are primarily controlled by type I IFN signaling 
In addition to classical type I IFN  or cytokine induced antiviral signaling  tumors may employ other antiviral defense mechanisms 
For example  stromal cells may secrete peptides with antiviral properties called defensins   
The defensins are amphiphatic and typically  –  amino acids in length and interfere with viruses by physically binding to and disrupting virus particles and or by inducing antiviral responses in target cells via pattern recognition receptors 
At least oral squamous cell carcinomas were found to overexpress defensins compared to normal control tissues   
While the role of defensins in oncolytic virus infection of tumors is unclear  one study showed that the immune stimulating properties of defensins may be exploited to increase overall therapeutic efficacy 
In this study  expression of beta   defensin from a conditionally replicating adenovirus yielded a superior therapeutic entity compared to the unarmed parental virus via enhanced anti tumor immune responses mediated by TLR dependent activation of dendritic cells   In summary  human cancers display varying degrees of expression of antiviral proteins or their signaling regulators at baseline 
Some of these may increase in response to genotoxic anti cancer treatments 
In the next chapter we will highlight some of the consequences to oncolytic virotherapy of the heterogeneity in type I IFN responsiveness in tumor cells All oncolytic viruses tested to date display variable infectivity in different cancer cell lines 
This variability is likely at least partly dependent on type I IFN as most oncolytic viruses are IFN sensitive 
IFN secretion follows virus sensing by the cells via Toll like receptors expressed on both the plasma membrane and in endocytotic vesicles  NOD like receptors  STING  AIM  NLP inflammosome and other danger sensing molecules  summarized elsewhere   
While all viruses carry an arsenal of counteracting molecules    no virus goes completely undetected 
Even HSV amplicons  which are devoid of functional virus genes  induce a type I IFN response that mediates a STAT dependent system wide antiviral defense in mice within one hour of intravenous vector injection  resulting in significant reduction of transgene expression compared to expression in STAT  knockout animals   During our own studies with attenuated SFV vector VA  it became apparent that the dramatic and lasting therapeutic efficacy achieved following mere single intravenous  or intratumoral  injection of the virus in immunocompromised mice bearing human A  melanoma or U  glioma xenografts   was not going to be recapitulated easily in immunocompetent animals   
The paradox in our studies was that while oncolytic SFV vector VA  effectively replicated in and destroyed a variety of IFN responsive cancer cell lines in vitro  it consistently failed to eradicate tumors generated from the same cell types in vivo  even if large doses of virus were injected directly into the tumor mass and even if the tumors were void of visible physical barriers  Figure  
Conversely  only tumors generated from IFN unresponsive cancer cells have seemed infectable in vivo by VA  so far 
In light of earlier findings by others  showing that type I IFN receptor knockout mice are highly susceptible to SFV infection and quickly succumb to multi organ systemic infection    the parameters for oncolytic SFV efficacy seem clear  tumor cells must be defective in type I IFN response for the virus to be effective These findings are in line with emerging data from other groups  showing a remarkably strict dependence of oncolytic virus replication on defective type I IFN responsiveness  a dogma introduced at the turn of the  st century   
For example  sarcomas and melanomas display differing permissiveness to oncolytic VSV  an obstacle which may be overcome by blocking type I IFN signaling   
In eight sarcoma cell lines  basal up regulation of RIG I and IFIT  and rapid induction of STAT  phosphorylation upon IFN I treatment correlated with resistance to oncolytic measles virus   
In other studies  human pancreatic and ovarian cancer cells display resistance against Rb dependent oncolytic adenovirus  strongly correlating with intracellular levels of MxA  and acquired resistance to repeated oncolytic adenovirus injections in an intraperitoneal ovarian carcinoma model was associated with an increase in MxA as well as several other key ISGs in the tumors   
A study comparing normal human or mouse melanocytes to a panel of melanoma cells revealed strong correlation between permissiveness to oncolytic VSV and capacity to mount antiviral defense in response to type I IFN   
In this study  VSV rp  harboring two mutations in P and L genes  was superior to several other tested oncolytic VSV strains  but the dependence on defective IFN responsiveness was still retained 
In yet another study  oncolytic VSV replicated in four out of twelve mesothelioma cell lines which were unable to mount antiviral defense upon IFN beta pretreatment or to respond to infection by up regulation of PKR  MxA or  OAS mRNA   
In contrast  the non permissive mesothelioma cells mounted antiviral defense  associated with PKR  MxA or  OAS mRNA up regulation  in response to infection or to exogenous type I IFN 
The authors of this study further linked the observed pattern of virus resistance to clinical mesothelioma samples  where in a mesothelioma tissue array  significant variance in immunoreactivity against PKR  p  and or IFNAR was observed  with only a few samples displaying lack of reactivity against all three components  arguing that most tumors in clinical settings would display at least some level of resistance to oncolytic VSV Oncolytic adenoviruses are often deleted for E A  which normally binds Rb and prevents it from sequestering E F  which results in the viruses being unable to replicate in normal cells 
However  since adenovirus  as with all viruses  contains elements that antagonize antiviral defenses  such elements have also been targets for deletion to render the virus sensitive to innate antiviral defenses  which would be expected to remain intact only in normal cells 
Cancer cells expressing Ras may down regulate protein kinase R and inhibit type I IFN induction by interfering with RIG I signaling   
Also  select interferon stimulated genes appear to be repressed by the Ras MEK ERK signaling cascade   
PKR activation shuts down E F dependent translation  including translation of virus messenger RNAs 
Therefore  an adenovirus deleted for VA RNA  which antagonizes PKR  should be capable of replicating in Ras overexpressing  tumor  cells 
However  while this was seemingly the case    it was later discovered that Ras is not an obligatory determinant for PKR inactivation and that virus replication was halted even in Ras overexpressing cells via functional PKR mediated E F phosphorylation  implying that the parameters of VA RNA deleted adenovirus replication had to be revised   
Similar findings were obtained with oncolytic reovirus  against which Ras independent tumor resistance emerged in vivo   
Thus  under some circumstances even tumor cells over expressing Ras may respond to type I IFN or to stimulants of pattern recognition receptors  activating PKR and inhibiting virus translation 
To complicate matters  MEK inhibitors have been shown restore antiviral signaling capacity in Ras overexpressing tumors   
This implies that human tumors treated with MEK inhibitors  such as Trametinib which was recently approved for treatment of BRAF mutated melanoma  may be poor targets for oncolytic viruses as antiviral signaling capacity in such tumors may be restored Some oncolytic viruses  such as members of the poxvirus family  are seemingly resistant to the antiviral effects of type I IFNs in vitro and may be controlled by other cellular factors   
However  in most cases  sensitivity or resistance to type I IFN is assessed in vitro and using only one cytokine  which may mask synergies with other factors present in vivo 
One possible explanation for the in vitro–in vivo discrepancy is the tumor micro environment  which not only imposes physical barriers to oncolytic viruses but also alters intracellular antiviral defenses 
For example  glioma cells were found in the brain to spontaneously secrete type I IFN  which conferred resistance against oncolytic HSV 
Resistance was linked to ECM protein CCN  interaction with glioma cell surface receptor alpha   beta   integrin  which activated interferon secretion   
It is tempting to speculate whether this or a similar ECM glioma interaction could have contributed to the resistance of syngeneic glioma cells we observed in vivo but not in vitro to both oncolytic SFV and vaccinia virus  FIG    
Also  while critical in many respects  antiviral signaling may occur without signaling via type I IFN receptor  IFNAR 
For instance  upon infection of IFNAR KO mice with murine hepatitis virus  MHV  brain cells were found to have upregulated antiviral GTPase TGTP and IFITm  and IFITm  all of which have confirmed antiviral activity in vivo against a variety of viruses   
In these cases  IFN gamma and TNF alpha likely account for at least part of the observed ISG activity  where e g  TGTP is upregulated by IFN γ signaling and TNFα has been shown to induce ISG  independently of IFNAR   Interestingly  while most cancers are heterogeneous in antiviral defence signaling  one broad class of tumors in particular may display consistently low capacity to ward off oncolytic viruses  oncovirus induced cancers 
This is because oncoviruses  as all viruses  carry a complement of factors that abrogate antiviral sensors and effectors  which may result in tumors that are uniformly devoid of antiviral signaling 
In an intriguing study  oncolytic VSV infected and destroyed human papilloma virus  HPV positive cervical carcinoma cells more effectively than HPV negative head  and neck cancer cells due to HPV E mediated suppression of antiviral signaling   
HPV positive or E expressing xenografts were efficiently eradicated from nude mice following VSV injection 
The potential of this approach is that even oncolytic viruses that are extremely sensitive to type I IFN  such as attenuated SFV or M mutated VSV  may function well against oncovirus induced cancers where the oncovirus machinery ensures the lack of antiviral defense While on first thought it would appear counterintuitive to antagonize the very factors that keep oncolytic viruses tumor specific  emerging data shows that this can be accomplished in a safe way 
One of the foremost strategies to increase oncolytic virus efficacy is to combine them with drugs that lower tumor antiviral defenses 
In this regard  a primary target for interference is the prototypical type I IFN signaling cascade 
While small molecular inhibitors against IFNAR are not available  activity of downstream signaling transducers may effectively be blocked 
Human pancreatic cancer cells were shown to constitutively express high levels of MxA and OAS and to mount type I IFN dependent resistance to oncolytic VSV 
Resistance could be overcome by blocking activity of IFNAR associated Janus kinase  JAK      
Similarly  JAK  inhibitor ruxolitinib overcame type I IFN dependent resistance of human SCC  head and neck cancer cells against oncolytic VSV   
Ruxolitinib also successfully abrogated type I IFN mediated antiviral effects elicited by macrophages    highlighting that this drug might also alleviate type I IFN dependent tumor resistance to oncolytic viruses imposed by stromal cells 
However  the obvious downside to using JAK inhibitors is their effects on critical host defense mechanisms  which may result in increased infection of normal cells 
Moreover  JAK inhibitors may reduce anti tumor immune responses elicited by oncolytic virotherapy 
For example  ruxolitinib was shown to impair the capacity of dendritic cells promote CD  T cell responses against model tumor antigens   
On the other hand  in this study clearance of adenovirus was delayed in ruxolitinib treated normal animals  which makes it difficult to predict the overall impact of JAK inhibitors on tumor therapy where prolonged virus presence might translate to better therapeutic efficacy 
Also  while the immune stimulating and anti tumor effects of type I and type II interferons may be adversely affected by JAK inhibitors  central tumor promoting cascades mediated by JAKs  such as IL STAT  may also be inhibited    yielding a difficult to predict net therapeutic outcome 
At the moment  more studies are needed to establish the overall impact of interference with JAK  signaling in cancer therapy Spurred by earlier reports of oncovirus reactivation and promoter enhancement by histone deacetylase  HDAC  inhibitors  this class of agents was assessed for capacity to enhance oncolytic virus potency by inhibiting antiviral responses 
Indeed  such enhancement was observed with oncolytic VSV and SFV  and while it has been difficult to pinpoint the exact mechanisms that underlie HDAC inhibitor enhancement of oncolytic virus replication in cancer cells  antiviral defenses in general are inhibited for yet unknown reasons mainly in cancer cells and not in normal cells  which indirectly facilitates virus replication   
Interestingly  combination of HDAC inhibitors with conditionally replicating   E A deleted adenovirus gave improved virus replication rate and therapeutic efficacy in subcutaneous xenograft models only when the inhibitors were given before the virus  otherwise inhibition of replication was observed   
Similarly  HDAC inhibitors increased replication and oncolytic efficacy of HSV when given before the virus but not when given at the same time   
With nuclear DNA viruses  such as adenovirus and HSV  it is possible that HDAC inhibitors also alter virus genome accessibility to transcription factors  resulting in reduced replication or other adverse effects  implying that with these viruses HDAC inhibitors should be administered before the viruses Recently  it was found that HDAC inhibitor vorinostat activates NfκB signaling by facilitating hyperacetylation of the p  subunit  which in turn activates cellular autophagy   
Autophagy was in another study shown to be important for VSV replication  presumably by inhibiting antiviral signaling 
This is interesting  as a previous study revealed enhancement of VSV replication by inhibiting TNF alpha induced antiviral signaling mediated by p  using NfκB inhibitors BMS  or TPCA    
In this study  neither inhibitor had an effect on STAT  or STAT  phosphorylation or their nuclear relocalization in response to type I IFN but the authors observed clear induction of ISG  GBP  and MX  in response to type I IFN in U  glioma cells  with the latter two being dependent on NfκB signaling 
Taken together  NfκB pathway activation may result in different antiviral responses in different cancer types  and inhibition or enhancement of oncolytic viruses by NfκB inhibitors is dependent on other concomitant cellular mechanisms  such as autophagy Since HDAC inhibitors modulate promoter activity accessibility  it is conceivable other epigenetic or promoter modifying agents could work in a similar manner to repress antiviral defense induction and enhance oncolytic viruses   
DNA demethylating agents  azacytidine  Aza  and decitabine synergized with oncolytic herpes simplex type   virus in glioma models in vitro and in vivo  as did HDAC inhibitor valproic acid  VPA  which was already shown before to work well with oncolytic HSV as well as several other oncolytic viruses   
Moreover  inhibition of cancer antiviral defenses  specifically RNAseL and PKR  resulted when cancer cells were exposed to sunitinib  a multi tyrosine kinase inhibitor originally developed as an inhibitor of VEGF R and PDGF R signaling  yielding strong anti tumor synergy with IFN sensitive oncolytic VSV   
Since sunitinib is approved for renal cell carcinoma and imatinib resistant gastric cancers  combination with oncolytic VSV constitutes a promising and clinically relevant approach warranting further investigation 
Interstingly  sunitinib as well as several other receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors displayed antiviral effects against polyomavirus BK    arguing that these compounds are not universal virus enhancers Cyclophosphamide  CPA  is a general immunosuppressant used to minimize Treg presence during immunotherapy and also oncolytic virotherapy 
CPA may  however  also enhance replication and efficacy of oncolytic viruses by diminishing cytokine secretion by stromal cells  including type I IFN   
Another compound enhancing oncolytic virus efficacy by lowering cell responsiveness to type I IFN is triptolide  which acts downstream of IRF  activation   
Further  the kinase mammalian target of rapamycin  mTOR  enhances the antiviral effects of type I IFN by activation of its effector proteins  E BP  which binds and inactivates translation factor eIF E  and S K  which carries out cell type specific signaling functions of type I IFN  such as activation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor  B and promotion of ISG  transcription 
Consequently  rapamycin was able to enhance oncolytic VSV replication and anti tumor efficacy by inhibiting type I IFN mediated antiviral signaling via mTOR   Several other compounds synergizing with oncolytic viruses have been identified via high throughput drug library screening  many of which seem to act by antagonizing antiviral defenses 
For instance  a novel virus sensitizer  Vse  was found to greatly diminish antiviral effects of type I IFN against oncolytic VSV in several cancer cell types  and the drug also synergized with the virus in subcutaneous mouse tumor models   
For many of these new compounds  the mechanism of action is still poorly understood  necessitating extensive safety studies to exclude undesirable effects against normal cells Apart from classical type I IFN induced antiviral defenses  which typically prevent virus translation and degrade virus genomes  other cellular machineries regulate oncolytic virus efficacy 
Notably  strategies to increase cancer cell death in response to oncolytic viruses have been tested 
In a recent study  a class of compounds called SMAC mimetics synergized in several cancer models with oncolytic VSV by removing cancer cell block to apoptosis in response to virus induced type I IFN  TNF α or TRAIL   
Interestingly  since virus infection triggered cytokines act on nearby non infected cells  SMAC mimetics may in combination with oncolytic viruses also cause significant bystander tumor destruction 
Normal cells are not affected by the IFN SMAC mimetic synergy  providing an important safety aspect 
In another study  blocking the ER stress response circuitry triggered by oncolytic rhabdovirus infection by a small molecular inhibitor of serine threonine protein kinase and endoribonuclease IRE α  which was identified in a genome wide siRNA screen  greatly enhanced cytotoxicity via caspase induced apoptosis and increased oncolytic efficacy in refractory tumor models in mice   
This effect was independent on induction or responsiveness to type I IFN 
Conversely  inhibitors of nucleoside transporter   ENT  were discovered from a high throughput screen of enhancers of oncolytic HSV  and to date such inhibitors have not been reported to alter cellular antiviral responses   
Other compounds  such as common chemotherapeutics  and their mechanisms synergizing with oncolytic viruses have been discussed elsewhere for most of them the possible role of antiviral defense antagonism in enhancing oncolytic virus efficacy remains to be studied   Thus  many compounds are available to interfere with tumor antiviral defenses 
The outstanding question for most of them  however  seems to be why such compounds do not render normal cells sensitive to oncolytic viruses 
Elucidation of the exact mechanisms of action and the differences between normal and cancer cells constitute a worthy goal for studies in the near future Already in the  s it became clear that using certain pathogenic wildtype viruses  such as West Nile virus and Bunyamwera virus  in cancer patients would result in off target toxicity   
Characteristic for pathogenic viruses is a greater ability to circumvent or antagonize cellular innate antiviral defenses than attenuated strains 
For example  unlike the prototypical oncolytic reovirus strain type   Dearing  the T L strain of reovirus causes accumulation of IRF  in the nucleus and inhibits activation of a select group of ISGs yet because of this property the T L strain is myocarditic unlike the oncolytic type   Dearing strain   
For these reasons  many oncolytic viruses used today  such as reovirus type   Dearing  oncolytic strains of Newcastle disease virus and M mutated VSV have either a stronger capacity to induce or a weaker capacity to resist antiviral type I IFN than the corresponding wildtype strains   An open question  however  is whether strain specific or virus specific differences that relate to specific components of the cellular antiviral machinery may be exploited for greater anti tumor efficacy  i e  if one virus fails  could another be used in its stead 
While Ras expression was critical for oncolytic reovirus replication in cells overexpressing CUG  oncogene  oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus was unable to replicate in the same cells due to increased activation of STAT  and OASL    
Thus  in these cells reovirus was not affected by STAT  or OASL  and it therefore remains interesting to see which other antiviral effectors may have been lacking in the CUG expressing cells and  conversely  how reovirus and VSV differ in terms of sensitivity to antiviral effectors 
While several oncolytic viruses have been compared to each other in terms of replication rate and cytotoxicity  systematic studies with regard to tumor antiviral defenses have not been conducted As any attenuated virus is likely to replicate effectively only in its own niche  i e  to be restricted by a specific set of ISGs  and as wild type strains may be too toxic for use in humans  a compromise may be achieved by incorporating select elements from wild type viruses into oncolytic virus backbones 
Indeed  several chimeric and recombinant viruses have been generated that harbor specific elements of wild type strains or even of other unrelated viruses in order to better resist cancer antiviral defenses  Table  
As an example of introducing wild type elements into attenuated viruses  Haralambieva reported on a measles virus Edmonston vaccine strain in which P gene was replaced with the counterpart from the wild type IC B strain   
Later  Meng et al 
included N  P  and L genes from wild type measles in Edmonston backbone  producing an enhanced but still safe oncolytic virus   
Edmonston vaccine virus induces a more robust IFN response compared to wild type measles virus partly due to the weaker ability of V protein to suppress MDA mediated activation of IRF  and IFN I induction   
In vivo  P gene encoded proteins  particularly V  control the quality of the cytokine response to measles so that vaccine strains qualitatively induce a stronger inflammatory response compared to WT strains  where WT V protein suppresses multiple cytokine secretion 
V protein short cytoplasmic tail has been shown to bind and inactivate STAT  IRF  MDA  and the Rel homology domain of the NfκB subunit p  but not of p    
Also  V causes LGP  protein to bind and inactivate RIG I    but it seemingly does not interfere with TICAM   TRIF  multiple TLR adaptor  including TLR mediated IFN β induction 
Thus  if cancer and normal cells would differ with regard to TICAM  or IRF  then such a virus could potentially target specifically cancer cells rather than normal cells 
So far  the measles Edmonston WT chimeras have proven safe in animals As an example of heterologous virus constructs  lentogenic Newcastle disease virus engineered to express influenza virus PR   H N  NS  showed enhanced oncolytic efficacy in vivo due to dampening of antiviral responses   
While such a virus did not display enhanced pathogenicity in that study  a mesogenic NDV virus harboring NS  from influenza strain H N  did show increased pathogenicity in chickens as well as an increased ability to replicate in human cells    raising some cautionary warnings for future engineering of similar replicative viruses 
As another example  vaccinia virus soluble type I IFN scavenger B R  NOTE  B R is often used in the literature  has been engineered into both oncolytic HSV and oncolytic rhabdoviruses  resulting in all cases in more effective therapy agents without loss of tumor specificity   
Oncolytic γ  gene deleted HSV was complemented by two different PKR antagonists from human cytomegalovirus  TRS  and IRS  generating a chimera capable of reaching wild type virus replication levels in cancer cells in vitro and in tumor models in vivo   The selection of various viral IFN I antagonists that potentially could be used to augment attenuated oncolytic viruses is vast   
For example  increased replication of several viruses  including HIV  Sindbis virus and E deleted adenovirus in mammalian cells was observed when the cells were engineered to express vaccinia virus E L protein  influenza A virus NS  protein  ebola virus VP  protein or HIV  Tat protein   
The choice of antagonist must primarily be made with safety in mind  but virus specific and cell specific differences in antagonist functions may potentially be exploited rationally when considering the overall combination 
For example  vaccinia virus E L is able to rescue VSV but not EMCV from exogenous IFN  whereas vaccinia virus K L partially rescued EMCV but not VSV   In anticipation of systematic  perhaps bioinformatically guided   super chimera  studies  two or more viruses that may complement each other s shortcomings in antiviral defense antagonism have been considered 
Notably  vaccinia virus was favorably combined with IFN I sensitive oncolytic VSV and SFV  yielding tumor model dependent increases in overall therapy efficacy that were dependent on vaccinia virus antagonism of type I IFN responses  which increased the replication of the IFN sensitive viruses   
Such heterologous virotherapy approaches may also be used to generate immunological synergy  similar to heterologous prime boost vaccination  anti tumor immune responses may be increased due to targeting of the tumor by two different viruses  on two separate occasions  but anti virus immune responses would be generated against different viruses each time  avoiding the problem of neutralizing immunity to and predominance of antivirus immune responses   
Some other ideas explored experimentally include engineering oncolytic viruses to express other oncolytic viruses 
For example  the entire oncolytic parvovirus H  genome was placed under a regulatable promoter in oncolytic adenovirus  resulting in a more effective therapeutic entity than either virus alone without loss of tumor specificity   
The genetic material of Semliki Forest virus replicons has been engineered into adenovirus and vaccinia virus backbones   and several other virus chimeras have been constructed   
However  the effects on tumor antiviral defenses of such a constructs remain to be studied The attribute  oncolytic  implies for a virus that it infects and  indeed  lyses the infected tumor 
This property is primarily tested in vitro in cultured tumor cells 
We have learned  however  that in the native tumor microenvironment in living hosts many viruses are no longer able to infect tumor cells or to kill them even if they manage to infect them 
Tightly packed tumor cells and the network of supportive molecules of the extracellular matrix form a physical barrier to virus particle diffusion 
It has also become evident that the tumor cells themselves may be much more capable of thwarting oncolytic virus advances than previously thought  with some tumor cells residing in a seemingly permanent non permissive antiviral state 
Tumors harbor multiple cell types in addition to the neoplastic cells  which may promote and propagate both physical and cellular virus resistance 
As the efficacy of virotherapy in human cancer patients still falls shy of the achievements in animal models  it appears quite plausible that one or more of the barriers described in this review indeed constitute a real and formidable obstacle for oncolytic virus advancement into routine clinical use 
Fortunately  some of the most difficult barriers have been identified  and a rapidly expanding arsenal of countermeasures is at our disposal 
Our task is now to separate the wheat from the chaff and to systematically evaluate the proposed combination regimens that will yield the best results without compromising patient safety Evidence of prenatal toxicity of herbal based indigenous formulations for sex selection in rat modelsTraditional or indigenous preparations  IPs  are getting considerable attention in global health debates  It continues to be used widely in several countries and its consumption is rapidly increasing 
 
  Many reports have documented the use of such preparations 
For instance  in China  traditional herbal medicines played a critical role during the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome  SARS  In fact  many drugs in modern medicine had their roots in the traditional system of medicine 
Drugs like Penicillin  from Penicillium fungi  and Digoxin  from Digitalis purpurea  are some such examples 
One of the promising therapies for Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus  MRSA  infection is a ninth century treatment for eye infections which is a recipe consisting of garlic and onions  wine  and bile from a cow s stomach brewed in a brass cauldron 
It is however important to note that culture specific practices are not always safe 
Digitalis is a classic example where herbalists use this plant in allopathic treatment strategies  while in some countries such as Britain  law restricts their vast availability  A report from Australia describes the adverse effects of ‘herbal  preparations or IPs  Problems arise when people do not report about the consumption of such preparations assuming that these are devoid of any side effects by virtue of them being natural products  The need for research in this field is huge and scientific research into the quality  safety  molecular effects and clinical efficacy is crucial 
 
 
Pregnancy is considered a time of minimal intervention  and a period when herbal medicines are usually contraindicated  It is reported that many women consume indigenous medicines  that contains Bryonia laciniosa  Quercus infectoria and Putranjiva roxburghii along with other ingredients  during early pregnancy to beget a male child in India 
These preparations  often called sex selection drugs  SSD  contain herbal ingredients but these are off the label prescriptions and hence cannot be certified as ‘herbal  medicines 
The prevalence of consumption varies from   to as high as         Studies have indicated that there is  –  times higher risk of birth defects including major malformations of internal organs like urogenital and renal malformation  trachea esophageal fistula  and visible defects like spina bifida  cleft lip palate and imperforate anus 
 
  Risk of stillbirths also increases   folds 
Studies suggest that a single exposure during pregnancy can be deleterious 
 
 
 
  SSDs are reported to contain phytoestrogens  steroids and heavy metals 
 
 
 
  It is also known that although placenta serves as a barrier  most drugs and environmental chemicals enter the foetal circulation by passive diffusion or active transport  However  despite growing evidence on deleterious effects of these herbal formulations  few studies have attempted to systematically understand the risk of such preparations using animal models 
Genetic sex of a child is determined at the time of conception by the fertilization of the ovum with X or Y sperms and intake of so called preparations for sex selection can never alter that In view of these  the current study was conducted with an objective to determine the embryo foetal and development toxicity of SSDs following maternal exposure during critical period of organogenesis using a small animal model The study was guided by the OECD guidelines for testing of chemicals  Guideline no    adopted on  nd January   Prenatal Developmental Toxicity Study  and was based on a mutually approved protocol 
Personal protection equipment was employed as required while handling the test system The test facility is registered and renewed  No 
 PO RcBi S CPCSEA dated July     for breeding and to conduct research on animals for commercial purpose by the committee for the purpose of control and supervision of experiments on animals  CPCSEA  Ministry of Environment  Forests and Climate Change  Government of India 
The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee  Venus Medicine Research Center 
Due permission was taken from the Ethics Committee of Indian Institute of Public Health Delhi For this experiment  strain of Sprague Dawley of rats  Rattus norvegicus  was used 
The number of dams per group was   instead of   as laid down under OECD guidelines 
Rats of both sexes  –  g  were obtained from National Institute of Biologicals  India at  –  weeks of age  acclimatized for five days and then subjected to the experiment at  –  weeks of age 
They were housed in standard polypropylene rat cages with stainless steel top grill  one dam per cage  at a temperature of       °C  with  –  relative humidity 
Bedding material and cages were changed once in six days and   hourly light dark cycle was followed 
Animals were identified by their existing ear numbering 
Cages were labelled by tags indicating the study number  sex  group of the animals  experimental start and completion dates 
Standard pelleted feed  from Ashirwad Industries  Mohali  India  was provided ad libitum to all the animals 
They also had free access to purified water via drinking bottles throughout the study 
The feed  cages and drinking bottles were not analysed for the presence of phytoestrogens and bisphenol A 
However  similar materials were used for all the rats across all groups The drug comprised of IPs for sex selection  SSD 
These non branded locally made preparations are made available  –  days after placing an order and are never sold openly 
These preparations essentially contain herbal ingredients such as Shivlingi  Bryonia laciniosa  Majuphal  Quercus infectoria  Putrajeevak  Putranjiva roxburghii  Nagkesar  Mesua ferrea  and feather of peacock  Pavo cristatus 
A total of   such samples of SSDs were procured from varied sources like ‘pansari  shop owners  grocers  local alternative medicine practitioners  rickshaw pullers  drivers and commoners from different states 
SSDs are advised to be consumed between   and   weeks of pregnancy The samples were categorized into   groups based on redundancy of the preparations and common ingredients reported 
This was followed by chemical analysis in an accredited laboratory to detect the presence of phytoestrogens and steroids 
Since we explored the toxic effects of these preparations we wanted to select two samples that would be most predictive of toxicity 
Due to resource constraints  we did not want to subject all the   samples for animal study 
Hence  three samples of SSDs  found to be most rich in phenols and steroids were selected for toxicity study  All the three samples were also tested for heavy metals which suggested that Lead and Mercury were in very high quantities  The toxicity was examined using C  elegans  an alternate animal model 
Survival analysis and reproductive toxicity was assessed from the brood size and progeny count assay  The two SSDs that were found to be most toxic were selected as test items for the subsequent study in rat models 
SSD   was reported to contain Shivlingi and Putrajeevak while SSD   contained Shivlingi  Majuphal  Putrajeevak  Nagkesar and feathers of peacock 
Both the samples were obtained from grocers 
Local preparations like these are bound to have certain degree of variability in concentrations but more often than not  these remain the major ingredients According to studies reported  women consume such preparations along with cow s milk in dosages and schedule that are quite varied 
While some advise these IPs to be consumed for one day  others prescribe it for   days  to be taken thrice a day 
We considered the amount of SSDs most commonly reported by pregnant women  weighing   kg  which was  –  g daily for   days 
The dose of the test item   mg kg  was calculated by using conversion factor of  Conversion factor is the ratio of the correction factors  estimated by dividing the average body weight in kgs of species by the body surface area in m  of the species  Km 
Human equivalent dose  HED in mg kg    Animal dose  mg kg  X correction factor  Km animal Km human 
Kms of every species are constant 
For humans it is    assuming average weight of adults to be   kg a surface area of   m  and for rats it is  Therefore  HED   mg  kg    animal dose X  
Or  animal dose         mg kg           mg kg Since pregnant women consume these orally  these were administered to rats by oral route The test items were coded as SSD   and SSD   and were provided to the experimental laboratory  Venus Medicine Research Center  Baddi  in powder form 
On the day of dosing  the doses were administered between  –  h  The test items were administered in fresh cow s milk at a final volume of   ml kg 
The doses were calculated on the basis of the latest body weight recorded for the study 
A stainless steel gavage cannula fitted to a calibrated syringe was used for dosing the animals For control animals  cow s milk was used as a vehicle while feeding The study was performed in two phases to evaluate the effect of SSD consumption duration during gestation period Adult  nulliparous female rats were mated with males of same species and strain in  
Each morning  dams were examined for the presence of a vaginal plug and vaginal smear was taken from each dam by using pipette smear technique 
The day of vaginal plug formation or sperms observed in vaginal smear  also known as successful mating  were considered as GD   Gestation day  
The mated females were housed individually in clear polycarbonate cages with stainless steel wire lids 
Mating process was carried out to result in   pregnant animals per group 
Successfully mated females were randomized into control and treatment groups 
All the rats were sacrificed on GD  
According to OECD guidelines  the test chemical should be administered daily from implantation to the day prior to scheduled caesarean section in order to assess toxicity 
Test chemicals were administered to pregnant animals and sacrificed as per the schedule  which was as close as possible to the normal day of delivery without risking loss of data resulting from early delivery i e GD  
The females were killed  before caesarean section  the uterine contents were examined  and the fetuses were evaluated for soft tissue and skeletal changes The pregnant rats were randomized to two intervention and one control groups 
SSD was given during pre implantation to implantation stage  GD  – 
Each group of rats was treated either with vehicle  G  VC  SSD   G    mg kg  or SSD   G    mg kg SSDs were given from GD  – 
Each group of rats was treated with either vehicle or SSD  or SSD

Cage side observations for clinical signs of toxicity in the animals were recorded once daily until the day before necropsy •Body weight  Body weight of all experimental animals were recorded once before mating  initial body weight  and then after confirmation of mating 
Body weights were recorded on days               and on terminal day before sacrifice 
These recorded body weights were used for calculating the dose volume to be administered •Food consumption  Food consumption was evaluated once after successful mating or on day   of gestation  the day of vaginal plug formation or sperms observed in vaginal smear  and on days             and one day prior to sacrifice 
Calculated amount of feed were placed in the trough of each cage and the quantity of feed remaining after approximately   h were weighed and recorded •Morbidity Mortality  All the animals were observed twice daily  once in the morning between   and   h and once in the evening between   and   h  for incidence of morbidity and or mortality •Maternal examination related parameters  At the end of the observation period  all the dams were sequentially euthanized  by CO  asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation  and subjected to gross necropsy 
After termination  dams were examined macroscopically for any structural abnormalities or pathological changes 
Blinding was done while evaluation of the dams during caesarean section and subsequent foetal analyses to minimize bias 
Pregnancy rate was calculated as the proportion of mated pairs that had produced at least one pregnancy within a fixed period where pregnancy was determined by the earliest available evidence that fertilization has occurred 
Gestation index was calculated to indicate number of females with live born as a proportion of number of females with evidence of pregnancy •Examination of uterine contents  Immediately after termination  the uteri were removed and the pregnancy status of the animals ascertained 
Gravid uteri including the cervix were weighed  and number of corpora lutea were determined 
The uterine contents were examined for numbers of embryonic or foetal deaths and live foetuses 
The degree of resorption was described in order to estimate the relative time of death of the conceptus 
Any increase in the number of resorption and or implantation loss is an indicator of litter size for the individual dam •Examination of foetuses  The sex and weight of each foetus were determined 
Approximately one half of each litter were prepared and examined for skeletal alterations from selected dams 
The remainder were prepared and examined for soft tissue alterations  using accepted or appropriate serial sectioning methods or careful gross dissection techniques 
Each foetus was examined for external alterations 
Foetuses were examined for skeletal alterations  using Alizarin Red S staining method 
The fetuses for skeletal staining were kept in pre labelled plastic containers containing   ethanol before staining 
After skinning  we processed the foetus for staining by immersing in   alcian blue   GX for three days  then performed rehydration through a gradient series of ethanol   ethanol   –  h twice    ethanol   –  h  ethanol   –  h  distilled water until the samples sank to the bottom of a conical tube 
Samples were further treated with   KOH for  –  days or until it became clear and again treated with   alizarin red for next  –  days until bones became purple 
Samples were rinsed   times in   KOH  for  –  h at each time point 
Samples were further treated with a gradient series of glycerol  KOH    h   glycerol   h X  Visceral examination was done by micro dissection technique 
Fetuses were preserved in   formalin until they became fixed 
An illuminated magnifier was used for visceral examination 
We placed the foetus in a supine position on a paraffin wax block tray covered with paraffin wax  secured the fetal limbs by paper pins to the paraffin wax block  made a ventral midline incision from the umbilicus  cutting caudally to the genital tubercle and cranially to the diaphragm 
Once incision was completed  we located the ventral attachment of the diaphragm and lifted the liver carefully to examine the diaphragm for abnormal opening 
After observation  the diaphragm was clipped 
We gave a longitudinal cut to open the rib cage slightly lateral to and on the right of the sternebrae and then extended the cut anteriorly to neck region 
The rib cage was opened gently and secured to the paraffin block petridish tray with pins Foetuses were examined for soft tissue alterations  e g 
variations and malformations or anomalies  using Wilson s Technique 
The fetal viscera were examined sequentially  beginning with thoracic organs and moving caudally 
We performed hearts cuts after completion of other observations 
We examined the bilobed thymus for size  shape  coloration and presence of haemorrhages and then removed it for observation of trachea and esophagus 
We observed the lungs for size  color and number of lobes  observed the trachea  esophagus for normal alignment and presence of fistula  opened the pericardial sac and cut off pericardium to expose the heart for observation 
We checked the size  shape  color of the heart and normal development of major blood vessels 
After observation of thoracic viscera  we observed the abdominal viscera and liver for size  shape  color  texture  and number of lobes 
External anatomy of heart was examined by making two incisions using micro dissecting scissors We examined the stomach  spleen  pancreas  small and large intestines for size  position or any other developmental anomalies 
The intestines were moved aside after observation for seeing the underlying structures 
Ureters were checked for normal size and location and for continuity from the renal hilus to the urinary bladder 
One kidney was cut transversely and another was longitudinally to examine renal papilla and renal pelvis 
To confirm the sex of the foetus  the gonads were inspected carefully 
We examined the reproductive organs for size  shape and location GraphPad Prism® statistical software version   was used to analyze the data and all the results were represented as mean   S E M 
Intergroup variance for most of the parameters was calculated by one way analysis of variance  ANOVA  followed by Tukey s test 
A value of p     was regarded statistically significant 
Linear regression was performed to examine the weight change of dams during pregnancy for each group comparing with the control after adjusting for the litter size 
The malformations were analysed by performing Chi square test for trend for two groups  SSD  G  G  G  G  and SSD  G  G  G  G The ARRIVE guidelines were followed to report the findings 
In phase   pre natal study  all the dams dosed with SSD  and SSD  had normal food intake and weight gain 
The average gain in weight from GD  to GD   was       gms for controls while it was       gms in SSD   and       gms in SSD 
 Webtable  
No test item related mortality or clinical sign of toxicity was encountered during the study 
All dams in treatment groups and control group survived to scheduled terminal sacrifice 
They showed normal behaviour until euthanized 
There were no differences in mean maternal body weights  body weight gains  pregnancy rate  gestational index  pre and post implantation loss  and resorptions 
No significant differences were observed in foetal sex ratio  foetal body weights 
However  one dam from SSD  had all male foetuses 
No abnormality was detected in skeletal and visceral examination In phase   controls and SSD  and SSD  treated dams exhibited a comparable food intake  Table  
 
However  a dose response relationship was observed with reduced weight gain with higher doses of SSDs 
 Table  
 
Two dams  one in G   SSD    mg kg  and the other in G   SSD    mg kg  categories showed decreased or consistent body weight GD  onwards 
On an average  the weight on GD   was       gms in controls while it was       with SSD    mg kg  and       gms with SSD    mg kg 
The adjusted analysis indicated that except in G  there was a significant reduction in weight gain in all the intervention groups as compared to the control group after controlling for litter size  Table  
 During follow up  one dam from SSD    mg kg  and one from SSD    mg kg  showed haematuria during gestational day  – 
However  no another clinical sign of toxicity was encountered during the study 
All the dams in treatment and control groups showed normal behaviour and survived to scheduled terminal sacrifice 
In phase   pregnancy rate and gestational index were found to be   at all dose levels with SSD  whereas  in SSD  it decreased to   in G   SSD    mg kg  and G   SSD    mg kg  groups 
One dam from G   SSD    mg kg  and another one from G   SSD    mg kg  group showed mating confirmation during vaginal smear examination and showed positive sign in initial days of pregnancy but during necropsy on expected day of delivery  GD   no foetus was found 
Body weights of dams increased in the initial stages that became constant at a later period 
To reconfirm it  non gravid uterus was stained in salewski strain and presence of conceptus was found 
This indicated the possibility of miscarriage Increased pre and post implantation losses as well as resorptions and reduced live foetuses were observed with both SSD  and SSD 
No significant differences were observed in foetal sex ratio  but decreased foetal body weights were noted in both sexes 
On an average one early resorption in a group was a normal observation 
More than one late resorption was observed in all treatment groups while there was none in the control group 
Total count of live foetuses count was significantly reduced with SSD  and SSD  treatment in a dose dependent manner 
Total number of live foetuses were reduced up to   in SSD  at   mg kg treatment group and   in SSD  at   mg kg treatment group Both SSD  and SSD s at different dose levels showed decreased fetal weight in dose dependent manner  although the difference was not significant 
Skeletal and soft tissue alterations were observed in both treatment groups 
In general  the embryo–foetal examination showed abnormalities  which could have caused some functional damage to these foetuses if allowed to grow in the normal course 
In visceral examinations  slight dilation of the renal pelvis  reduced papilla size  urinary bladder hypertrophy was observed in few foetuses from both SSD  and SSD  treatment groups 
Few incidences of foetal soft tissue abnormalities encountered in this study were normal variants 
Skeletal examination showed variations in the ossification patterns like incomplete or poorly ossified skulls  ossification of sternebra  cleavage ossification of thoracic centrum  asymmetric thoracic centrum  and supernumerary rib in many foetuses in SSD  and SSD  groups  Table  
 
A trend was noted with increased incidence of certain malformations with increasing dosages of SSDs that was statistically significant for most malformations with SSD The results of this developmental toxicity study suggest that administration of SSDs to pregnant rats had significant impact on intrauterine foetal growth  early and late resorption as well as developmental anomalies 
These formulations have teratogenic potential but does not affect sex ratio IPs contain phytoestrogens like diadzein and genistein  In vitro rat whole embryo culture assay  WEC  studies of genistein in rats have indicated fetotoxic and teratogenic potential at concentration of ≥  μg mL  However  in vivo  an oral  gavage  embryonic and fetal development pilot study could not demonstrate any teratogenic effect in the same study 
These findings are different from our study probably because we used SSDs containing natural herbal and non herbal ingredients unlike those studies where synthetic genistein was used 
In both the studies  decreased body weight was observed indicating slight maternal toxicity 
Food consumption was unaffected in our study which is contrary to what was reported 
In another study  pregnant rats exposed to oral isoflavones  diadzein and genistein in varying combinations  showed alterations in the number of live foetuses  lysed foetuses  number of resorption sites  and implantation sites while no clinical signs suggestive of maternal toxicity  seizures  tremors and salivation  that was observed similar to our study 
Maternal mass gain was significantly reduced in rats treated with   mg kg of isoflavones  Ratio of females to males in the litter of different groups was similar akin to our finding  These observations clearly nullify the claim that consumption of SDDs could alter the sex of the growing foetus 
An analysis done by the same authors earlier revealed that SSDs contain testosterone and steroids 
 
  The prenatal testosterone in pregnancy is known to affect sexual development adversely      The principles of reproductive biology state that the genetic sex of an individual is determined at the time of conception and can never be altered under any circumstances 
However  phenotypic sex of the growing foetus is likely to be influenced by the hormonal milieu of in utero environment 
Our analysis was confined to phenotypic sex only and hence it is difficult to state if any differences existed with reference to genetic and phenotypic sex 
This requires further inquiry Evidence on the effects of SSDs on humans should best be obtained from human beings 
The findings of the current study corroborate well with the evidence generated from observational studies in human beings      Presence of skeletal and visceral malformations could explain why stillbirths are likely to be more in women who consume SSDs 
The dosing of the test drugs was intended not only to examine the period of organogenesis solely but to assess effects from preimplantation  through the entire period of gestation to the day before caesarean section 
The results were based on observations of more than   female animals with implantation sites at necropsy that added to its strength 
Unnecessary handling of pregnant animals as well as any stressors from outside was avoided 
At least three dose levels and a concurrent vehicle control were used with dams randomly allocated to different treatment groups that support the validity of the results 
However  absence of   rats per group does not support it to be a fully OECD compliant study 
We did follow the principles of Good Laboratory Practices  GLP  but due to constraints of resources the study could not be conducted as a GLP compliant study  though this is optimal for academic interests There is a lack of systematic approach to assess the safety and effectiveness of herbal preparations 
Ingredients for herbal medicines are often drawn from different sources and are used in combination  which may exhibit variability in terms of species  growing conditions  and biologically active constituents 
To isolate each active ingredient from each herb and then to establish its toxicity is time consuming  resource intensive and not practical 
Moreover  drug approval process does not accommodate undifferentiated mixtures  Though important  it surpasses the herb herb interaction and the potentiating effect of one compound over another 
Therefore  in our study  we administered the herbal mixture to assess the effects 
Real time evaluations have yielded important observations for several herbal drugs especially related to pregnancy 
For instance  Wang et al 
  used mice model to evaluate the adverse pregnancy outcomes after maternal exposure to the herbal medicines  particularly during early pregnancy  The major events included maternal and perinatal mortality 
Maternal weight gain  embryo growth and post natal weight gain were significantly decreased 
Moreover  foetal resorption and skeletal malformations were increased  signifying potential toxicity of Chinese herbal medicines 
This is comparable to our findings To conclude  the results of this developmental toxicity study suggest that administration of SSD  and SSD  to pregnant rats exerted significant impact on intrauterine foetal growth and development without any effect on sex ratio when administered during the period of organogenesis

It is therefore natural to expect that the distribution of amino acids  across all protein sequences  would appear to be fixed  given no mutations over a specific period of time 
Of the   naturally occurring amino acids  each seems to appear randomly located at a particular position within the sequence of a protein 
However  when the sequences of a group of proteins are compared to one another  specific patterns begin to emerge 
These patterns are commonly referred to as motifs and frequently produce similar structural elements and in many cases  similar functions between the proteins that contain them 
In recent years  significant efforts have been made to reduce sequences into discrete motifs  so that each can be linked to some specific biological function based on particular rules      
Databases that consist of identifiable amino acid motifs  such as PROSITE  Pratt and EMOTIF  have been constructed to allow researchers an easy classification of unknown proteins into families based on their common motifs               
All of these methods share one property  they depend on specific alignment algorithms  such as the basic local alignment search tool  BLAST or PSI BLAST  to perform the sequence comparison between diverse families of proteins being analyzed      
These methods have already led to a number of key discoveries and offer the promise of determining biologically meaningful information about function from a protein s primary sequence It is generally accepted that a strong correlation exists between a protein s amino acid sequence and its resulting structure and function         
Techniques that can quickly determine significant similarities between protein sequences are valuable in predicting an unknown protein s function within the cell 
Here we describe a procedure that  by computing the frequency of key amino acid pairs  can quickly classify large groups of proteins into functional groups 
In order to uncover any relevant amino acid strings  we have utilized statistical methods applicable to datasets with large fluctuations in the search of human protein sequences within both the Swiss Prot and Complete Human Genebank databases The goal of this manuscript is to demonstrate how these two residue motifs can be used to develop rapid methods for searching protein or genomic databases in order to locate potentially interesting or aberrant protein sequences 
As an example  we describe the distribution of select amino acid pairs within the genome of the Coronavirus  Tor  which is responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome  SARS    
We have examined additional sets  but the limited format of this paper precludes a large presentation of potential applications The set of all   naturally occurring  amino acids are described by their standard single letter representations  and are taken as the complete set contained within all protein sequences as shown below Zq A R N D C Q E G H I L K M F P S T W Y V Residues that are arranged in a certain order can be referred to as vectors and are represented symbolically as b n b b bn bj Zq The coordinates of each vector represent the amino acid symbols contained within any given protein  where n is the total length of the vector 
The collection of all vectors b n  in the proteome can therefore be denoted simply by Zq n The underlying structure of a protein sequence  which is the order of the amino acids  has unique and identifiable characteristics 
As an analogy  in written English  the letter q is almost always followed by u 
Also  the frequency of the word  and  is much higher than that of the related three letter strings   nad   nda   dan  and  dna  which are simply permutations of the same set of individual letters to construct a word with a different meaning 
Utilizing similar characteristics  we can intuitively scan for unique sequence vectors contained within any given protein 
We expand on these characteristics  by utilizing the concepts of affinity and order stability in Section  Using the entire Swiss Prot database  release number   as the basis for our calculations  we have constructed a probability table for the occurrence of the   naturally occurring amino acids  see Table  
    
In addition to the Swiss Prot database  we have also included data from Complete Human Genebank  NCBI Build Number   March    as a source for all characterized and hypothetical human protein sequences We use the symbol Ω to denote the Swiss Prot database  and the letter M to denote the number of proteins in the database  
Hence we can state that Ω As s M  where As a a as Ns  is the sth protein  ai with i Zq is the ith amino acid in the sequence  and Ns is the length of the protein sequence As 
For any vector b n  if there is a sequence As in Ω such that b n  is a segment of As  then we can say b n  occurs in Ω 
We can then use NΩ b n  to denote the total number of outcomes that b n  has occurred in Ω  and let NΩ n  be the total number of all vectors occurring in Ω with length n  Therefore p b n NΩ b n NΩ n is the probability that the vector b n  occurs in Ω 
We then introduce k p q b n log p b n q b n where p b n  and q b n  are any two probability distributions on Zq n  and b n  belongs to Zq n 
The quantity k p q b n  in Eq 
  is defined for any two probability distributions p b n  and q b n  on Zq n  where the distribution q arises from independent letter  i e  amino acid  probabilities 
Then  k p q b n  can be viewed as a random variable about b n  and its probability distribution is defined as follows F p q x PI k p q b n ⩽x b n k p q b n ⩽xp b n The expectation value μ p q  and variance σ p q  of p b n  are expressed mathematically as μ p q b n Zq n p b n k p q b n 
 σ p q b n Zq n p b n k p q b n μ p q  Hence we see that μ p q  is simply the Kullback–Leibler entropy   
As a consequence  μ p q  is always non negative and μ p q  if and only if p b n q b n 
As a result  the amino acid sequence of b n  can be represented by k p q b n In Eq 
  the probability distributions p  q in the k p q b n  have several possible values 
For example  if we let p be the probability of b n  and only change the value of q in k p q b n  we obtain the following expression q b n j np bj p b p b p bn Based on Eqs 
  and   the value of k p q b n  gives us the affinity for all amino acids within vector b n 
Here two situations are identified as especially interesting i When k p q b n  implies that among the amino acids in vector b n  there is an increased affinity 
That is  the vector b n  occurs more frequently than expected 
 ii When k p q b n  implies that among the amino acids in vector b n  there is a decreased affinity 
That is  the vector b n  occurs less frequently than expected In a similar approach to the condition described above  we may choose q b n p πn b n  where πn b n  is a permutation of b n  and πn denotes a permutation transform 
In this case  the order sensitivity of b n  can also be reflected by the value of k p q b n  and produces the following outcomes i when k p q b n  implies that b n  occurs much more often than πn b n ii when k p q b n  implies that πn b n  occurs much more often than b n In addition to the concepts of affinity and order sensitivity  we can also design other analysis techniques by choosing alternate representations of q b n 
Quantifying the terms k p q b n  we can represent vector frequency numerically 
In cases where k p q b n μ p q ⩾ σ p q  the corresponding vector b n  is called  positive  while in those cases where the opposite takes place  k p q b n μ p q ⩽ σ p q  the vector b n  is called  negative 
By judiciously choosing a   equal to   we obtained   two residue  positive pairs  and   two residue negative pairs  see Table  
  out of a total of   possibilities of amino acid pairs Using any one of the positive motifs from Table   we can develop a test method to detect changes in their distribution through any protein database 
If b b b  is  positive  then p b b μ σp b p b  where p ⋅  is the probability of the amino acids or vectors ⋅ in the database 
Since NΩ μ M Nμ p bj NΩ bj μ MNμ we have NΩ b μ M Nμ μ MNμ μ σp b NΩ b or NΩ b μ M Nμ μ MNμ μ σp b NΩ b and since μ M Nμ is very close to μ MNμfor Swiss Prot database we have NΩ b μ σp b NΩ b and NΩ b μ σp b NΩ b As a consequence of Eq 
  the detection of a deleterious mutation based on the increased appearance of an arbitrary string of these residues becomes possible 
For example  according to Table   CC is an attractive motif with   then NΩ CC μ σp C μ M Nμ μ MNμNΩ C ≈ μ σp C NΩ C Let Ns CC  and Ns C  be the number of CC and the number of C in the sth protein 
Then we have NΩ CC NΩ C  because μ σ  and p C  since NΩ CC s MNs CC NΩ C s MNs C Based upon the result that the CC pair represents a rare event  proteins satisfying Ns CC Ns C  as defined in Eq 
  suddenly become interesting 
We can therefore consider the number Ns CC  as an index to develop detection methods to test for the presence of a CC containing protein within a database 
Using this same reasoning  one can also use any other one of the remaining motifs in Table   to develop detection methods for additional proteins In an identical fashion to the previous example using the positive two residue motifs in Table   we can also use any of the  negative  two residue motifs to develop search methods 
For example  the CM pair is a  negative  two residue  word  with  
That is  p CM μ σp C p M 
Using identical arguments to those described in Section   we obtain NΩ CM NΩ M  and NΩ CM NΩ C 
Since both Ns M  and Ns C  are small numbers for fixed proteins  the overall number of CM pairs in most proteins should be close to zero 
Therefore  we can also use any of the remaining seven  negative  motifs in Table   to develop additional detection methods In contrast to the CC motif  the total number of proteins in the Swiss Prot database having more than one CM pair is quite small 
For example  among the   proteins contained within this database  the number of proteins such that Ns CM ⩾  is   and the number of proteins satisfying the condition Ns CM ⩾  is only  
For human proteins in Swiss Prot  the total number of proteins containing CM pairs is   and there are only   proteins that satisfy Ns CM ⩾   Table  
However  we would expect to find about   proteins having CM pairs in the Swiss Prot database  based upon the amino acid frequencies given in Table   which is greater than the number observed Cysteine rich proteins and the presence of CC pairs in proteins are both concepts that have been studied previously      
If we combine these two concepts and describe them in mathematical terms  we observe that the rates q Ns C Ns and q Ns CC Ns C  describe these two conditions  where Ns  Ns C  and Ns CC  are the numbers of all amino acids  cysteine  and CC  respectively 
We can then derive proteinsNs C Ns p C σ Ns CC Ns C p ξτ C ξτ C σ where σ  and σ  are the standard deviations about Ns C Nss Mand Ns CC Ns C s M respectively We have found the following computational results based on Swiss Prot database σ ≈ σ ≈ andp ξτ C ξτ C ⩾ p C For   we have a much simpler method to determine that a protein sequence is both C  and CC rich if proteinsNs C Ns ∩proteinsNs CC Ns C So  a much simpler method to test whether a protein is a both C  and CC rich for   isNumber of CC  Number of C Number of C  Length of protein Using this principle  we found a total of eight proteins that are both C  and CC rich within the Swiss Prot database For   there is an easier method to determine whether a protein sequence is both C  and CC rich if proteinsNs C Ns ∩proteinsNs CC Ns C So  a much simpler method to test whether a protein is both C  and CC rich for   is based on the inequalitiesNumber of CC  Number of C Number of C  Length of protein Using this principle  we can get a total of   proteins that are both C  and CC rich within the entire Swiss Prot database For   there is also an easier method to determine if a protein sequence is both C  and CC rich sequence when proteinsNs C Ns ∩proteinsNs CC Ns C So  a much simpler method to test whether a protein is both C  and CC rich for   is based on the inequalitiesNumber of CC  Number of C Number of C Length of protein Using this principle  we have identified a total of   proteins that are both C  and CC rich within the Swiss Prot database 
From these results  it becomes clear that there are many C rich proteins and many CC rich proteins that are not mutually inclusive 
The sets of both C  and CC rich proteins are only subsets of the set containing all C rich proteins or that containing all CC rich proteins Because the Swiss Prot database is somewhat biased to those proteins that are of interest to researchers  we have decided to examine a database that was  in essence  complete 
For this  we chose the human subset sequences contained within the Complete Human Genebank database 
This was the most complete and readily available source of human genetic sequences and should therefore provide us with an accurate representation of both CC and CM pair distributions 
We observed that the total number of CC pairs within the human subset of sequences contained in Genebank  a total of   proteins  was  
These pairs were contained within a total of   proteins  Table   a number that is substantially larger than the   we obtained from Swiss Prot data  Table  
Since the total number of amino acids in The Complete Human Genebank is   we can easily get the expected number of CC in Complete Human Genebank is   which is much less than this actual value  
The same also holds true for the CM pair  where we would expect to see   CM pairs  but actually observe    Table  
 
This result is surprising but true and shows that there are fundamental difference between the Human and other species in terms of the frequency of CC and CM pairs To create a single CM pair  it is obvious that one needs only a single C  If a protein sequence also contains a CC pair  the total number of cysteines available to create a CM pair has been reduced by a factor of  
Using the cutoff value of four CC pairs as statistically significant  we determined the probability of finding a CM pair within proteins that already contained a CC pair  Table  
Even though both CC and CM can occur in the same protein  the total number of proteins in Genebank that contain both CC and CM pairs is   and these pairs almost always occur at different locations in the sequence 
However  in some rare cases the second C within the CC pair is shared with the first C within the CM pair  giving us a new triplet CCM If we filter the set of proteins described above for redundant entries  we obtain a set of   unique proteins that contain the CCM triplet in the human proteome 
Using the probability distributions obtained from Swiss Prot  we obtained the probability of CCM as  
Since the total of all protein lengths in the Swiss Prot database is   there should be a total of   CCM triplets 
This value is almost identical to the predicted number of CCM of  
This result suggests that the CCM triplet at least in Swiss Prot occurs randomly 
However  we can also analyze the CCM probability using a different approach  putting q CCM p CC p M  into Eq 
 
If CCM occurs randomly  then we have p CCM p C p C p M  and since p CC μ σp C p C  we will get k p q CCM log p CCM q CCM log p C p CC ⩽ μ σ Based on Eq 
  it is clear that the presence of a CC pair strongly excludes M  Therefore  the probability of the CCM triplet should occur less frequently than that of CC or M individually We have obtained the following statistical results with regard to the total number of CC and CM pairs contained in the Swiss Prot database i The total number of these proteins satisfying Ns CC ⩾  is   and   of these are found in humans 
 ii The total number of human proteins in Ω that satisfy Ns CC ⩾  is  
 iii The total number of the proteins in Ω that satisfy Ns CM ⩾  is     of these are found in humans 
 iv The total number of human proteins in Ω that satisfy Ns CM ⩾  is only  
The genome of the SARS associated Coronavirus contains a total of   open reading frames  which code for six characterized and five uncharacterized proteins   
After examining the complete proteome the SARS associated Coronavirus we observed a statistically significant increase in the occurrence of the CC and CM pairs in the SARS associated Coronavirus  genome Of the   putative proteins  four contain either CC or CM pairs 
Two large poly proteins  GI  and GI  contain   CC and   CM pairs  as well as   CC and   CM pairs  respectively 
The putative spike glycoprotein  GI    contains   CC and   CM  while the small envelope protein  GI    contains only   CC pair 
The remaining   proteins  of which two have been identified as a nucleocapsid and matrix protein  contain no CC or CM pairs 
When compared to the occurrence of CC and CM pairs within all human proteins found in the Swiss Prot database  it becomes clear that there is an increased occurrence of these pairs within the SARS associated Coronavirus proteome It is clear that the frequency of CC and CM pairs is significantly higher in the SARS genome than it is in the human genome 
It is our hope that these unique two residue motifs could be used as a means of identifying a virus such as SARS 
While currently impossible to determine  one can see a possible clinical use for determining the frequency of CC or CM pairs in an individual 
If a person has been infected by SARS  we would expect the numbers of CC and CM pairs to be much higher than in a healthy individual 
If we were then able to develop a clinically feasible technique that could identify the CC or CM pair content in total cellular protein  without damaging the cell  it could be possible to implement a detection method simply by counting the numbers of CC or CM pairs in all proteins examined 
If the presence of increased CC or CM pairs was indicative of infection by SARS we could develop new drugs to inhibit the translation of proteins that contain these pairs within infected cells 
As a very specific example  this could be accomplished through the use of specific tRNA mimics that could block translating ribosome when these pairs appear at the P and A site simultaneously      
While tRNA mimics could normally be seen as non specific protein synthesis inhibitors  the lower frequency of the CC or CM motifs in host proteins as compared to the relatively high occurrence in viral protein provide a starting point for the analysis of treatments using methods such as these In this paper we have performed a detailed search of the Swiss Prot and Complete Human Genebank database in relation to the frequencies of each of the   natural amino acids and motifs made up of two residues 
This has provided us with a new insight into the distribution of proteins within these databases and the information that may be contained within a protein s primary amino acid sequence 
Our focus in this quest has been to examine specific pairs or triplets of residues and use probability theory to assess whether or not particular strings of residues occur more frequently than their probability would indicate 
By analyzing affinity and anti affinity  we developed a procedure to search out all two  and three residue clusters within these databases 
Through this technique  we can rapidly classify large groups of proteins into families based on the occurrence of these motifs 
Combining this concept with a specific knowledge of protein function  we propose novel ideas aimed at developing fast detection methods for specific diseases based on the unusually high occurrence of some of these motifs when compared with the expected probabilities 
A timely example of the application of this method is given  namely the analysis of the SARS virus 
This method will hopefully lead to the discovery of new diagnostic techniques and possible treatment of diseases  by recognizing the location of target domains in the expressed sequence Cell type specific expression of the putative SARS CoV  receptor ACE  in human heartsThe coronavirus disease    COVID  caused by SARS CoV  infections imposes a major threat for the world s healthcare systems and is leading to thousands of deaths 
Angiotensin converting enzyme    ACE  has been identified as a potential receptor for SARS coronavirus  and is also considered the main receptor for SARS CoV  SARS CoV  binds to ACE  via its glycosylated outer membrane spike proteins 
ACE  is highly expressed in the lung and heart  and is known for its vital role in the cardiovascular system –  Although SARS CoV  mainly invades alveolar epithelial cells  it can also cause myocardial injury  as assessed by increased troponin T and NT proBNP levels accompanying increased cardiovascular symptoms in COVID infected patients  It is unclear whether elevated biomarkers of cardiac injury  or long term effects on the cardiovascular system  are directly caused by viral infection of cardiac tissue or are secondary to hypoxia and systemic inflammation 
However  patients with underlying cardiovascular disease represent a significant proportion of the patients who may suffer from a severe course after COVID  infection  This situation may be aggravated by findings showing that ACE inhibitors  which are often used to treat cardiovascular diseases  augment the expression of the SARS CoV  receptor ACE  in lung cells  This is probably mediated by an effect on angiotensin II  which is known to reduce ACE  expression  Thus  ACE inhibition decreases angiotensin II  leading to an indirect up regulation of ACE  The effect of angiotensin II receptor blockers  ARBs  which primarily target the angiotensin receptor   is unclear 
One may speculate that ARBs indirectly reduce ACE  levels by augmenting free angiotensin II levels  which in turn is expected to down regulate ACE  via activating the angiotensin receptor  
However  the effect of the two different treatments on the expression of ACE  in the heart requires further investigation Therefore  we used single nuclei RNA sequencing to determine the expression of ACE and ACE  in the different cell types of the human heart 
Gene expression signatures were detected in cardiac tissues of five patients with aortic stenosis  AS  and two patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction  HFrEF   Figure  A  and compared with with samples of one healthy donor heart  age    years  male  that was not used for transplantation 
After single nuclei RNA sequencing  data were pooled  and unsupervised clustering was performed with a total of     nuclei 
We found   distinct clusters 
Using cell type specific gene markers  major cell types were annotated  including cardiomyocytes  six clusters  fibroblasts  one cluster  endothelial cells  three clusters  leucocytes  two clusters  pericytes  one cluster  and smooth muscle cells  one cluster   Figure  B–D 
ACE  was expressed in cardiomyocytes  Cluster   and   and mural cells  particularly pericytes  Cluster   and was detected at a lower expression level in fibroblasts  endothelial cell  and leucocytes  Figure  D 
Comparison of ACE  in a pooled analysis of nuclei of the different groups showed that ACE  was significantly elevated in cardiomyocytes of patients with heart disease compared with healthy controls  Figure  E 
ACE  was also slightly  but not significantly  increased in endothelial cells  and the expression was lower in fibroblasts of patients with heart disease compared with healthy controls  Figure  E 
Immunostaining confirmed an increased expression of ACE  in cardiomyocytes of patients with aortic stenosis  Figure  F 
In addition  ACE was augmented in cardiomyocytes of patients with AS and HFrEF  Figure  G 
Interestingly  cardiomyocytes of patients who were treated with ACE inhibitors showed a significantly higher ACE  expression compared with ARB treated patients  Figure  H 
Moreover  patients treated with ACE inhibitors had an imbalance of ACE to ACE  expression  with a more than four fold higher ACE ACE  ratio compared with healthy control cells  Figure  I In conclusion  these data provide novel insights into the cell type specific expression and regulation of ACE  in the heart 
Patients with varying heart disease aetiology show augmented expression of ACE  levels particularly in cardiomyocytes 
Treatment with ACE inhibitors tends to be associated with increased ACE  mRNA and unfavourable ACE ACE  ratios  which are believed to be a driver of cardiovascular pathologies  This study is limited by its small sample size and therefore is only hypothesis generating 
However  these novel data suggest that it will be important to monitor SARS CoV infected patients for cardiovascular complications and assess the impact of ARB ACE inhibitor therapy 
Conflict of interest  none declared New onset acute symptomatic seizure and risk factors in coronavirus disease   A retrospective multicenter studyIn December   pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus  later called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus    SARS‐CoV‐  was first reported in Wuhan  China 
On March     the World Health Organization  WHO  declared the syndrome caused by SARS‐CoV‐  infection  coronavirus disease    COVID‐  a pandemic 
According to a WHO Situation Report of April    
 
 there are   confirmed COVID‐  cases and   deaths globally 
COVID‐  affects people of all ages 
 
  
 
 and in severe cases  it may cause dyspnea  hypoxia  acute respiratory distress syndrome  and septic shock 
 
  
 

The current situation has raised concerns regarding whether people with epilepsy have a higher risk to be infected with COVID‐  and whether people would develop acute seizures during the course of COVID‐ 
The objective of this study is to clarify the incidence and the risk of acute symptomatic seizures during acute COVID‐  infections This retrospective multicenter study was approved by the ethics committee of West China Hospital  Sichuan University  approval   
The study was conducted in   officially designed hospitals in Hubei province  the epicenter of the COVID‐  epidemic in China  Sichuan province  and Chongqing municipality 
These hospitals included the East Branch of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University  West China Ward  Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital  and hospitals in Sichuan province designated by the government to treat COVID‐   see the list of hospitals in Appendix S People with COVID‐  who were discharged from or died in the participating hospitals between January   and February     were consecutively enrolled 
All cases were diagnosed according to the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for COVID‐   trial version  
 
 All those enrolled tested positive through nucleic acid detection 
Disease severity was classified as mild  moderate  severe  or critical according to the national guidelines  see Box   for classification criteria 
 
 For our study  we aggregated severe and critical cases into a single severe group  whereas mild and moderate cases were aggregated into a single milder group 
The clinical outcome at discharge was either cured or death Electronic medical records of all enrolled cases were reviewed by   neurologists using a standard case report form  Appendix S 
Data were extracted on demographic characteristics  medical history  complications  treatments  and presence of risk factors for seizures 
These risk factors were considered to be the following  acute cerebrovascular disease  traumatic brain injury  TBI  central nervous system  CNS  infection  shock  hypoxia  severe metabolic disturbance  based on criteria from the International League Against Epilepsy
 
  multiple‐organ dysfunction syndrome  sepsis  and exposure to drugs or toxic substances Continuous variables were presented as median  interquartile range  and categorical variables as n  All of   people discharged from or who died at participating hospitals were consecutively identified and enrolled 
Most were from Sichuan province  n     followed by Chongqing  n     and Hubei  n    Ten individuals died  giving case fatality rates of    n     in Hubei     n     in Chongqing  and    n     in Sichuan 
Of the   severe cases      received mechanical ventilation  and     were given sedatives 
Apart from the effect of sedatives  mental state was relatively normal in   people 
Eight were encephalopathic  one was obtunded  one was delirious  and six were comatose 
The diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus was not made in any of these cases based on clinical presentation  results of investigations  or response to therapy 
No routine or long‐term electroencephalogram  EEG  was recorded due to exposure concerns None in this cohort had a past history of epilepsy 
None had any seizures  including febrile seizures  or status epilepticus during hospitalization 
Seizurelike events were seen in two people  it was believed that this was the result of an acute stress reaction in one and hypocalcemia in the other The first was a  ‐year‐old woman who reported bilateral bodily spasms lasting for about   minute  with mouth deviation but no impairment of awareness 
She was evaluated neurologically and psychiatrically and was diagnosed with an acute anxiety disorder  which was treated with olanzapine  paroxetine  and diazepam The second case was a  ‐year‐old woman who displayed bilateral myoclonus in the limbs with no impairment in consciousness   hours after admission 
Although this was initially suspected to represent seizures  she was found to have an electrolyte disturbance including hyponatremia  hypokalemia  and hypocalcemia  and the myoclonus resolved with correction of the metabolic disturbances Eighty‐four   cases reported systemic or direct brain insults that increased their risk for acute symptomatic seizures  Table  
The most common risk factor was hypoxia 
No severe electrolyte disturbance was seen  but hypokalemia  n       hyponatremia  n       and hypocalcemia  n       were frequently seen in the cohort 
Urea  creatinine  and serum glucose levels were moderately altered in most of cases 
In two cases who had chronic kidney dysfunction  substantial increases in creatinine levels were noted 
Results of investigations are shown in Table  
One case with TBI had an epidural hematoma  cerebral contusion  and skull base fracture 
Five people with severe COVID‐  experienced septic shock 
Three other cases of shock had hypovolemia or cardiac problems 
Ninety‐four   were given antibiotics  moxifloxacin  n       piperacillin sulbactam sodium  n       and third‐generation cephalosporins  n       were most commonly used We found no new onset seizures or status epilepticus in a large cohort of people hospitalized during the acute phase of COVID   infection despite a substantial proportion having risk factors for acute symptomatic seizures 
This is useful information  given the prior lack of knowledge about seizure risk during the acute phase of infection No individual in this cohort had a history of epilepsy prior to hospital admission 
To date  there is not much information available on people with epilepsy during the COVID‐  crisis 
There is one report of epilepsy in a case COVID‐  from Wuhan 
 
 As information is limited  it is not possible to establish whether this was a patient who had a history of epilepsy or whether the patient presented acute seizures 
There is at this time little if any evidence indicating that people with epilepsy are at an increased risk of COVID‐  infection 
A major challenge for people with epilepsy in this outbreak is nonadherence with the prescribed antiseizure medication  which was seen during the in SARS endemic in  
 
 This indicates the need to ensure the availability of supplies of medications and to advocate patients  self‐management 
Possible strategies for coping could also include online consultations and telemedicine networks Although many neurological and systemic disorders regarded as potential triggers
 
 of acute symptomatic seizures were identified in this cohort  seizures and status were not seen 
Stroke is one such risk factor 
The risk of developing acute symptomatic seizures after stroke ranges from   to  
 
 Acute cerebrovascular disease is considered a major cause of seizure and status epilepticus 
An earlier study from Hubei
 
  
 
 also reported six people with COVID‐  who had acute cerebrovascular disease without seizure 
Infection of the CNS can also give rise to seizures 
Although there is limited evidence of the presence of the SARS‐CoV‐  in the cerebrospinal fluid  CSF  the co‐occurrence of tubercular meningitis
 
 had been reported  with no seizure or status observed 
To determine whether COVID‐  can cause direct CNS insults requires further follow‐up 
In the earlier outbreaks of another coronavirus  a generalized convulsion with a positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for SARS‐CoV in CSF was reported  which could have been a coincidence 
 

Disturbances of homeostasis may lead to acute symptomatic seizures 
Hypoxia  the most common complication in our cohort  may trigger anoxic encephalopathy  particularly in refractory hypoxia 
Electrolyte disturbances as seen in COVID‐  are considered to be potential causes of acute symptomatic seizure 
 
 The severity and speed of such disturbances may affect onset of seizures  so these parameters should be carefully monitored The cytokine storm syndromes
 
 behind severe infection may cause the production of inflammatory cytokines systemically  with the consequence of acute toxic encephalopathies 
Although sepsis is a common cause of encephalopathy in intensive care medicine 
 
 hypoxia appears far more often than sepsis in COVID‐ 
There was also a high rate of septic shock in the COVID‐  population  varying from  
 
 to   in earlier studies in Hubei 
 
  
 

Certain antibiotics have been associated with symptomatic seizure 
 
 Antibiotics were used in a large number of people in our cohort without problems  but the most used antibiotics in the cohort were of low or moderate risk 
Clinicians should keep this seizure risk in mind when prescribing antibiotics  especially for people with renal dysfunction 
 

Our study has several limitations 
First  as a cross‐sectional study  we only have data from the acute phase of the disease 
A follow‐up study is underway to evaluate longitudinal seizure outcomes 
Second  the retrospective study design meant that we could not collect data on all relevant variables  for example  EEG was not recorded  so subclinical seizures could have been missed 
As all health care costs of COVID‐  treatment are covered by the government  all those suspected of infection are screened 
This may assure the objectivity and reliability of study materials  and it will allow for a future follow‐up study Our analysis suggests that COVID‐  poses minimal risk for seizures during the acute illness  although a significant proportion of severely ill individuals have risk factors that may increase the propensity to experience seizures 
These risk factors should be promptly addressed to minimize the risk of developing seizures 
Prospective long‐term studies must be done to determine whether people who have suffered from COVID‐  have an increased risk for developing seizures or epilepsy in subsequent months or years as a consequence of their illness None of the authors has any conflict of interest to disclose 
We confirm that we have read the Journal s position on issues involved in ethical publication and affirm that this report is consistent with those guidelines Decreased prealbumin level is associated with increased risk of mortality in hospitalized elderly patients with COVID The coronavirus disease    COVID  epidemic is caused by an infection with a novel coronavirus  officially named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus    SARS COV 
The infection spread rapidly on all continents and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization 
As of April       documented cases were reported worldwide  and   patients had died 
As there are currently no specific treatments and medications against the new virus  it is crucial to identify risk factors of severe prognosis Older patients have poorer prognostic factors and are more likely to experience critical disease 
 
 
Based on recent statistical data of China  among patients who were   years and older  the mortality rate was   which was significantly higher than that of younger patients at  
The proportion of deaths over   years old accounts for   of the total deaths in the national wide  which implicates aged people are more vulnerable to the SARS CoV 
Till present there are rare reports in literature focusing on the risk factors for poor outcomes of the elderly patients with COVID Serum prealbumin  known as transthyretin  its levels may be lowered not only by malnutrition  but also by inflammation and aging 
 
 
Compared to albumin  prealbumin has a shorter half life  a more rapid rate of hepatic synthesis  and predictable catabolic rate  hence  it may be a more sensitive indicator 
However  whether prealbumin could be an independent predictor of mortality in hospitalized COVID  elderly patients needs to be further elucidated The present study aims to describe the clinical characteristics and to investigate whether the prealbumin can serve as a valuable predictor of in hospital mortality  which might provide evidence for the risk stratification in elderly and help to improve the clinical practice and reduce fatality We designed this study as a retrospective cohort study design 
The elderly patients with COVID  who were admitted to Tongji Hospital in Wuhan from January   to February     were consecutively included 
This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Tongji Hospital  Approval Number  TJ IRB  and was complied with the Declaration of Helsinki 
The data were anonymous and the study was observational  so the informed consent was not gathered 
A flow diagram illustrating patient selection was described in Figure  
 
Inclusion criteria included elderly patients  ≥   years old  diagnosed with COVID  infection 
A total of   participants have been obtained 
Patients having missing baseline or outcome data  died on admission or being transferred to other designated hospitals during hospitalization were excluded 
There were   patients were included in the final analyses Data collection of participants was performed using hospital electronic medical record system 
Information included medical history  demographic data  physical examination  and hematological  biochemical  radiological and microbiological evaluation results were reviewed 
The data collection forms were reviewed independently by   researchers  CL and LYY 
Blood examinations were assessed at the central laboratory of Tongji Hospital following standard operative procedures 
The routine blood test was analyzed using Sysmex XE  hematology analyzer  Sysmex  Kobe  Japan 
The Cobas C   Roche  Mannheim  Germany  was used to measure the biochemical parameters 
Coagulation tests were detected by STA R MAX coagulation analyzer  Diagnostica Stago  Saint Denis  France 
Throat swab samples were collected and were tested for SARS CoV  with commercial real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  RT PCR  kit from DAAN GENE  Guangzhou  China 
The diagnostic criteria and all clinical procedures in this study followed  Diagnosis and Treatment of Pneumonia Caused by New Coronavirus  Trial version   to   promulgated by the National Health and Health Commission of China Summary statistics of baseline characteristics of all patients and stratification by prealbumin tertiles were expressed as frequency and proportion for categorical variables  mean   standard deviation  SD   Gaussian distribution  or median  range   Skewed distribution  for continuous variables  and as percentages for categorical variables 
The differences between groups were analyzed using the χ   categorical variables  One Way ANOVA test  normal distribution  or Kruskal Whallis H test  skewed distribution We examined the relationship of the prealbumin as categorized into tertiles with the outcomes of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation 
Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to evaluate these relationships  then unadjusted and adjusted odds ratio  ORs  and   confidence intervals  CIs  were calculated 
Model   is the minimally adjusted model with only sociodemographic variables adjusted 
Model   is the fully adjusted model with covariates including age  sex  smoking status  history of hypertension  history of coronary heart disease  history of diabetes  history of chronic kidney disease  history of carcinoma  history of chronic liver disease  neutrophil  lymphocyte  prothrombin time  activated partial thromboplastin time  d dimer  alanine transaminase  aspartate aminotransferase  total bilirubin  blood urea nitrogen  creatinine  C reactive protein and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio 
We calculated odds ratio  ORs  and   confidence intervals  CIs 
The highest tertile was the reference for prealbumin 
We performed test for linear trend by entering the median value of each category of prealbumin tertile as continuous variable to examine the possibility of nonlinearity To ensure the robustness of our results  we also performed stratified analyses with the prealbumin as a continuous variable for the overall population and stratified by gender  age  hypertension status and coronary heart disease status at baseline 
Generalized additive models were used to visually confirm the relationship between prealbumin as continuous variable and the risk of outcomes  all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation Modeling was performed with the statistical software packages R  http www R project org  The R Foundation  and EmpowerStats  http www empowerstats com  X Y Solutions  Inc  Boston  MA 
P values less than    two sided  were considered statistically significant In our study    cases were excluded 
To avoid selection bias due to missing data  we performed a sensitivity analysis 
The results showed that there was no statistical difference between missing group and non missing group  supplemental table  Of   elderly inpatients included in the final analysis  the mean age was     years  ranging from   years to   years  and most patients were male  table  
 
The baseline characteristics of these included participants were listed in table 
The day of sample drawing after admission was       day 
No significant statistical difference in sex  smoking status  body weight  BMI  comorbidity  hypertension  coronary heart disease  chronic kidney disease  cerebral vascular disease  carcinoma  chronic liver disease  symptoms  fever  cough  headache  diarrhea and myalgia fatigue at admission  were detected across different groups of prealbumin  tertile 
When compared with subjects in the highest tertile  those in the lowest tertile were older  more likely to have diabetes medical history  with higher Neutrophil count  lower lymphocyte count  worse coagulation function and liver function 
A total of     patients required mechanical ventilation      patients admitted to intensive care unit and     patients died during hospitalization 
The incidence of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation were significantly decreased across prealbumin tertiles  all cause death    vs    vs    for tertile   vs  tertile   vs  tertile   ICU admission    vs    vs    for tertile   vs  tertile   vs  tertile   mechanical ventilation    vs    vs    for tertile   vs  tertile   vs  tertile   respectively To investigate the correlation between prealbumin and in hospital outcomes  we constructed three models using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models  table  
 
In the unadjusted model  the ORs of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation was significantly increased as the prealbumin tertiles downgraded 
The OR for tertile   was significantly higher than the OR for tertile    OR       CI    to   P   for all cause death  OR       CI    to   P   for ICU admission  OR       CI    to   P   for mechanical ventilation 
Additional adjustment for the demographic variables and comorbidities did not reduce the ORs for the association between prealbumin tertiles and in hospital outcomes 
Further adjusting for the baseline levels of blood examinations  including blood routine  neutrophil  lymphocyte  neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio  coagulation function  prothrombin time  activated partial thromboplastin time  d dimer  liver fuction  alanine transaminase  aspartate aminotransferase  total bilirubin  renal function  blood urea nitrogen  creatinine  and infection indicators  C reactive protein  did not affect the relationships in the fully adjusted models  OR       CI    to   P   for all cause death  OR       CI    to   P   for ICU admission  OR       CI    to   P     for mechanical ventilation 
Therefore  lower tertile of prealbumin exhibited an increased risk of worse in hospital outcomes  full adjusted P for trend for all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation  P     P   and P     respectively Generalized additive models  Fig  
A through  C  were used to visually assess functional relationships between the prealbumin as continuous variate and the risk of in hospital outcomes 
Serum prealbumin was found to have negative linear relationship with the risk of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation To determine the consistency of the relationship between baseline prealbumin as a continuous variable and in hospital outcomes  we conducted stratified analyses  Table  
 
For each unit increase of prealbumin  the adjusted OR for all cause death was   in males  P     and   in females  P    
The adjusted OR for all cause death for persons less than   years of age was    P     compared with    p     for persons   years and older  P interaction    
For each unit increase of the prealbumin  the OR for all cause death was    P     and    P     for normotensives and hypertensives     P     and    P     for non diabetic and diabetes respectively 
The difference of interaction was not significant between two groups  P interaction         and   stratified for gender  age  hypertention and diabetes respectively 
Moreover  the relationship between baseline prealbumin with ICU admission and mechanical ventilation stratified by gender  age  hypertention and diabetes are consistent In this study  we found that lower serum prealbumin significantly associated with an increased risk of worse outcomes and all cause death during hospitalization 
Patients in the lowest tertile of prealbumin were older  and with higher Neutrophil count  lower lymphocyte count  worse coagulation function and liver function compared with subjects in the highest tertile 
Then we adjusted relevant covariates including age  sex  smoking status  comorbidities  neutrophil  lymphocyte  coagulation function  liver function  renal function and C reactive protein to minimize the potential impact of confounding 
Compared with crude regression analyses  this association still persisted when adjusting for demographic and clinical variables in the multivariable regression analyses 
Moreover  stratified by gender  age  hypertension and diabetes  increased level of serum prealbumin was associated with the decreased risk of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation  which determine the consistency of the relationship between lowest serum prealbumin tertile and the increased risk of worse outcomes in elderly COVID  patients Several previous studies have demonstrated baseline prealbumin change in COVID  patients 
Decreased level of prealbumin was observed among COVID  patients 
Wu C et al investigated   patients with COVID  and observed that prealbumin was associated with the development of ARDS  indicating the potential value of prealbumin level on COVID  clinical ending 
Till date  no report exists on the effect of prealbumin in COVID  elderly patients High proportion of severe to critical cases and high fatality rate were observed in the elderlyCOVID  patients  and rapid disease progress was noted in the dead 
One possible explanation involves the greater potential of seniors to be in a state of inflammation  nutritional deficiency and other complications 
Prealbumin is a globular  non glycosilated protein  synthesized by the liver  and complexed with a retinol binding protein  which acts as a transporter of retinol vitamin A and thyroid hormones 
Low plasma prealbumin level has far back emerged as an earliest laboratory indicator of poor nutritional status 
 
 
In addition  prealbumin are also associated with inflammation 
Previous studies showed that in response to the inflammation  the body responds by synthesizing a large number of cytokines 
These include interleukins and tumor necrosis factors that down regulate  decrease  plasma concentrations of albumin and prealbumin 
 
 
Therefore  assay of serum prealbumin concentration is recommended by some investigators as a screening marker for both malnutrition and inflammation Elderly with low plasma prealbumin levels mean that those people are at greater risk of malnutrition and inflammatory conditions  which may lead to poor prognosis 
Malnutrition is commonly seen in hospitalized patients in both the developed and developing world  especially among elderly patients 
A review of   published studies of acute care patients reported that malnutrition incidence ranged from  –  of hospitalized elderly 
It was found that compared to non famine regions of India  experiencing famine had significantly higher influenza mortality rates during the   Influenza pandemic 
Aging  frailty  and chronic diseases are associated with impaired immune function and are compounded by immune dysregulation from malnutrition 
When immune response is dysregulated  it would result in an excessive inflammation  even death 
In the current COVID  study  it was found that elderly patients have higher levels of white blood cells counts  CRP  inflammatory cytokines and are more likely to experience critical disease than did those younger patients 
 
 This retrospective cohort study included   elderly COVID  patients  until the date of February       of patients required mechanical ventilation    of patients admitted to intensive care unit  and the total in hospital mortality was  
The mortality rate was lower than that reported by wang L et al  among elderly COVID  patients 
This may have been the reason for some patients at the date of February     are still in hospital 
Nevertheless  this would not bias the relationship between prealbumin and in hospital outcomes because of the definite observation time we set previously 
Moreover  Wuhan tongji Hospital as one of the largest third grade Class A hospitals equipped with advanced life support training and equipment may partly account for the moderate mortality The results of this study have several clinical implications and strengths 
A low prealbumin concentration can therefore be regarded primarily as a signal identifying the at risk elderly patient who would suffer worse outcomes and requires careful assessment and monitoring for whom nutritional support and Inflammation detection may be needed as part of the treatment plan 
As observational study was susceptible to various confounders  we adjusted many variables that may affect the relationship between prealbumin and in hospital outcomes to minimize potential confounding 
In addition  we tested the robustness of the results by repeating the analyses in different subgroups of gender  age  history of hypertension and history of diabetes Our study has some limitations 
First  by including patients still in hospital as of J February     the case fatality ratio in our study cannot reflect the true mortality of elderly COVID 
Second  the record of data may be affected by prehospital medication and the time interval between admission and onset 
Third  since all subjects in our study were hospitalized Chinese elderly patients diagnosed with COVID  results of this study might not directly be applied to other ethnicities and age groups In conclusion  this retrospective cohort study revealed that the prealbumin is an independent risk factor for the in hospital mortality in the Chinese COVID  elderly patients 
Nutritional support and Inflammation detection should be careful assessment and monitoring for the elderly patients with low prealbumin concentration

Coping With COVID  Emergency Stress  Secondary Trauma and Self Efficacy in Healthcare and Emergency Workers in ItalyThe coronavirus disease  COVID  or the acute respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus    SARS CoV  began spreading in China at the end of   and  to date  represents an international health emergency without precedents in terms of its health  economic  and organizational effects on people s lives  World Health Organization   
After China  Italy was the first country to be affected by this epidemic  with the first deaths on February     and a rapid increase in the spread of infection and mortality 
COVID  was first detected in Northern Italy  and it then spread  although at different rates of incidence  to the other regions 
It was immediately evident that healthcare and emergency workers were at great risk of contagion and that protection and intervention protocols needed to be introduced in the absence of adequate points of reference because of the exceptional nature of the epidemic  the rate of spread of the infection  the seriousness of patients  health condition  and the mortality index 
The extreme conditions in which health workers have had to work  especially in the most affected regions in Northern Italy  are indicated by the following data from the Italian National Institute of Health   over   doctors died and   other health workers were infected within the general context of the population of   deaths and   infections in a span of   weeks 
It was also clear that the medical staff would experience serious psychological repercussions because of the working conditions as well as the difficulty of having scientific points of reference on care and intervention procedures 
To this must be added the increase in workload  the extension of working hours and  for health workers  the frequent exposure to the suffering and death of their patients 
Therefore  healthcare and emergency workers were subjected to serious psychological as well as physical stress 
Hence  the aim of this study  which was also the aim of a previous study  Vagni et al    is to focus on the similarities and the differences in the stress management of two professional groups healthcare and emergency workers during the acute phase of the pandemic 
Both groups have had to deal with COVID patients as frontline responders and have been exposed to the related risks of infection and psychological consequences  which  to date  have not been examined in detail through a comparative analysis As regards the stress that they experience  the literature clearly explains that healthcare and emergency workers who intervene in emergency situations are exposed to the risk of developing dysfunctional reactions that can be identified at different levels physical and or physiological  e g  psychosomatic disorders  sleep wake cycle alterations  and sense of tiredness  emotional  e g  irritability  nervousness  agitation  anger  low self esteem  and guilt  cognitive  e g  distractibility  sense of ineffectiveness  and negative anticipation of events  and relational  e g  increase in conflicts within emergency teams and or with their organization institution  and social withdrawal and may also develop reactions from secondary trauma  Del Missier et al    Sbattella    Argentero and Setti    Fraccaroli and Balducci    Bellelli and Di Schiena    Walton et al   
Faced with stressful events regarding which they lack previous experience and specific  necessary knowledge  and which cause tension owing to the need for rapid decision timings and a sense of responsibility  emergency workers may experience a sense of decision ineffectiveness 
In fact  emergency situations are characterized by high levels of decisional and operational uncertainty with associated regret and guilt  Del Missier et al   Several studies have highlighted that insufficient instructions and a lack of personal protective equipment  PPE  are important predictors of stress for healthcare and emergency workers in large scale emergencies  Oh et al    Du et al    El Hage et al    Walton et al   
Oh et al 
  highlighted that nurses involved in managing the Middle East respiratory syndrome  MERS  experienced lower levels of stress when the levels of goods supply and hospital training were higher 
Some studies have highlighted that frontline healthcare workers had lower secondary traumatization scores than non frontline health workers and the general public in contrast to the findings of previous research on the SARS outbreak in the same area in Singapore  Chan and Huak   
According to Barleycorn   and Tan et al 
  these results may be due to the dedicated training and psychological support given to healthcare workers after the SARS outbreak and demonstrate the validity of policy strategies for prevention of stress in the psychological health field An analysis of   studies published from January to March   aimed at investigating the stress experience of healthcare workers in facing COVID  shows that health workers experienced symptoms of depression and anxiety related to this stressful experience 
Moreover  the severity of their symptoms was influenced by their age  gender  role  specialization  type of activity performed  and exposure to patients with COVID  however  prevention  resilience  and social support interventions mediated their response to stress  Bohlken et al   
In a review of the literature  Spoorthy   underlined that sociodemographic variables  such as age  gender  profession  and workplace  and psychological variables  such as poor social support and self efficacy  affect the stress level experienced by health workers 
In addition  COVID  emerged as an independent stress risk factor 
Xiao et al 
  found that social support plays a role in reducing the anxiety levels in medical staff and increases their sense of self efficacy According to Walton et al 
  the specific stressors that health workers face in the COVID  emergency are related to the organizational context 
The challenges for medical staff include not only an increased workload but also a fear of infection  the need to work with new protocols that change frequently  and the use of PPE 
In uncontrollable situations such as a pandemic  when specific action protocols are absent and limited resources are available  health workers must make individual decisions with a heavy burden of responsibility that may be contrary to their moral principles 
For example  in the case of COVID  they may have to choose which patients to save because only a few places are available in intensive care 
In this regard  Cai et al 
  showed that for a sample of   healthcare professionals who worked closely with COVID  patients in Hubei  the most stressful factors were the lack of protocols for the treatment of COVID  the scarcity of PPE  the exhausting work shifts  their concern about the risk of infection  and their exposure to the death and suffering of their patients 
They also found that the support of superiors proved to be one of the most important motivational factors for medical staff  and the presence of clear guidelines and effective safety protocols were protective factors against the development of stress  in particular  for females 
Further  Walton et al 
  identified the organizational stressors as the changes in work shifts  the prevalence of night shifts  an excessive workload  staff roles  autonomy  the lack of support from superiors  and the absence of adequate information and clear instructions 
On the basis of these stressors  they estimated that   of the medical staff working on the front line of this pandemic are at risk of developing post traumatic stress disorder  PTSD 
In addition  limited resources  longer shifts  decreased hours of rest  and the occupational risks associated with COVID  exposure have increased the physical and mental fatigue  stress  anxiety  and burnout of these staff members  Sasangohar et al   The loss of a social support network  which can be an important resilience factor  is another risk factor  Ozbay et al   
In the COVID  emergency  healthcare and emergency workers have often experienced a separation from their affective links  either because of the restrictions on social contacts imposed by the lockdown or the fear of spreading the infection to their family members 
To this must be added that although  at first  health workers received unanimous encouragement from the population  later  they also experienced demonstrations of stigma and isolation 
Some studies have shown that being able to resort to their own social support network is a significant protective factor for health workers dealing with this emergency  Cai et al   As Favretto   stated  when individuals experience situations that go beyond their coping strategies  their vulnerability to  and risk of developing  psychopathological reactions increases 
Studies conducted during previous epidemics  such as the SARS  MERS  and Ebola epidemics  converge in detecting how healthcare and emergency workers may experience extremely high levels of stress and even develop secondary traumatic stress or vicarious trauma 
This trauma is defined as an experience of symptoms similar to those found in people with PTSD  such as in emergency nurses working with traumatized patients  Beck   
Figley   defined it as a form of stress that derives from the feelings of empathy experienced when helping traumatized people 
The symptoms may include intrusive recurring thoughts  disturbed sleep  fatigue  physical symptoms  hyperarousal  increased stress response  anxiety  depression  and feeling emotional  Adriaenssens et al   
Wolf et al 
  described how nurses may feel  overwhelmed  and this condition becomes a source of moral distress that triggers feelings of powerlessness  guilt  fear  anger  and frustration The sense of frustration and impotence felt by nurses when they are unable to treat and save a patient has been highlighted as a risk factor for secondary traumatic stress in several studies  Missouridou   
Avoidance and emotional numbing can become tools for self protection from intrusive symptoms that exceed the personal tolerance level  Coetzee and Klopper    Mealer and Jones   
Their frustration obviously intensifies on a patient s death 
The onset of PTSD in the health workers involved in treating MERS was also detected after the acute phase of the emergency was over  highlighting a risk not only in the immediate period but also in the medium term period  Lee et al   In reference to COVID  updated studies conducted on Chinese health workers have already highlighted the strong impact of the epidemic on the psychological health of doctors and nurses 
Some studies have found that healthcare workers have high levels of anxiety  depression  insomnia  and distress  Lai et al    Li et al    Zhu et al   
In particular  female professionals with more than   years of experience and previous psychiatric pathology present more risk factors of developing the symptoms of stress  anxiety  and depression  Lai et al    Zhu et al   
Huang J 
Z  et al 
  studied stress levels during the COVID  emergency in a sample of medical staff 
They found that females showed higher levels of anxiety and PTSD than males did and that the levels were higher for nurses than for doctors 
Moreover  Li et al 
  found that nurses had developed higher levels of vicarious trauma than those of the general population and that nurses who did not work closely with COVID  patients showed a more severe symptomatology  both physical and psychological  compared with their colleagues working on the frontline emergency services 
In Italy  a study conducted on healthcare workers found that doctors and nurses developed high levels of stress and anxiety  greater than those developed by the general population  and that healthcare workers operating in the North  the area of Italy most affected by the virus  showed a more severe symptomatology  Simione and Gnagnarella   
This study also confirmed that females tend to have a greater perception of the risk of infection  which increases their risk of developing the symptoms of anxiety and distress Because of their long  intense exposure to various stressors  it is important to note the nature of the coping strategies used by these healthcare and emergency workers in these situations and their effectiveness in terms of reducing and effectively coping with stress 
Indeed  the effective management of stress levels in the acute emergency phase could reduce the risk of developing long term PTSD or other pathologies  such as anxiety and depression  Fullerton et al    Slottje et al    Argentero and Setti    Sakuma et al    Birinci and Erden    Li et al   
Coping may be defined as a series of cognitive and behavioral efforts to manage specific internal or external issues that test or exceed individual resources  Lazarus and Folkman   
A distinction can be made between problem focused and emotion focused coping strategies 
The former is aimed at modifying and solving the stressful situation through active interventions 
By contrast  emotion focused coping is aimed at managing the emotions connected to the stressful event and regulating affective reactions  such as anxiety and the tension of response to stress  for example  by trying to avoid the threat  denial  or re evaluating it  reappraisal The choice of coping strategies is influenced by the individual s cognitive evaluation of the event  termed secondary evaluation  which involves estimating the resources available and the most effective strategies to deal with the situation  Lazarus and Folkman   
A key element of this assessment is the extent to which the individual can maintain control over the outcome of the situation 
The literature indicates that individuals apply dysfunctional coping when they face an uncontrollable event by responding primarily with a coping strategy focused on the problem  and conversely  when they face a controllable situation  they respond with coping strategies focused on emotions  Strentz and Auerbach    Vitaliano et al   
A coping strategy may be defined as adaptive when the controllability of the stressful event corresponds with the choice of coping strategy  in this case  the subject will experience fewer symptoms related to stress  Park et al   The strategies used to cope with trauma may differ among individuals  but they can also vary according to the profession and the features of the traumatic event  Nydegger et al   
Individuals differ in their choice of coping strategies  Connor Smith and Flachsbart    and factors related to the situation can also have a decisive influence on such choice  Brown et al   
A few studies have considered the ways in which gender influences the perception of stress in emergency situations and the choice of coping strategy 
These studies highlight that females tend to perceive events as more negative and uncontrollable and to resort more to coping strategies focused on emotions and avoidance  whereas males tend to resort more to applying problem focused coping and to inhibiting emotions  Matud    Matud et al    Matud and Garcia   The literature on the relationship between coping strategies and the stress levels of emergency workers has shown that the use of coping strategies focused on the problem usually tends to correlate with lower stress levels  both in healthcare workers  Watson et al    Howlett et al    and in other emergency workers  such as firefighters  Brown et al   
However  a coping strategy frequently used by emergency workers is that of avoidance and minimization  and this strategy is associated with higher levels of stress  Brown et al    Chang et al    Kerai et al    Witt et al    Theleritis et al   
Loo et al 
  found that in a group of emergency workers  avoidance as well as coping strategies focused on emotions were associated with the development of post traumatic symptomatology 
Rodríguez Rey et al 
  revealed that among health workers working in a pediatric emergency department  approximately   of the variance in PTSD was explained by the frequent use of coping strategies focused on emotions and the infrequent use of those focused on the problem 
In addition  Kucmin et al 
  who considered a sample of   paramedics  highlighted that the risk of developing PTSD symptoms was predicted by the use of coping strategies focused on emotions However  the literature does not offer unanimous results 
Chamberlin and Green   found that in a group of firefighters  all coping strategies actually correlated with high levels of stress  the authors explained this finding by suggesting that it is not the individual coping strategies that are maladaptive in themselves  but that greater effort is needed to adjust in stressful situations 
By contrast  Young et al 
  indicated that firefighters use problem focused coping strategies more often at the beginning of the operation and emotion focused coping strategies more commonly in the phase of breakdown and fatigue 
However  after the incident  they use both strategies  Young et al   
A meta analysis by Shin et al 
  highlighted that different coping strategies have different effects on work burnout  in particular  emotional stress and depersonalization are associated with the use of emotion focused coping strategies  whereas professional ineffectiveness is associated with the use of problem focused strategies Further  a few studies have investigated the coping strategies that emergency workers can use during health emergencies similar to COVID 
Maunder et al 
  revealed that healthcare professionals who tended to apply dysfunctional coping strategies  based on avoidance  hostile comparison  or self blame  tended to develop higher stress levels 
Wong et al 
  highlighted that during the SARS epidemic  doctors and nurses tended to use different coping strategies 
The doctors tended to turn more to action planning  but this strategy did not affect their stress level 
Instead  their stress level was positively correlated with their use of coping strategies based on emotional outlets 
By contrast  the nursing staff tended to resort more to behavioral disengagement and distraction strategies  which  however  correlated with higher levels of stress among them In this regard  during the MERS epidemic  hospital staff tended to adopt coping strategies related to the use of PPE and the adoption of all prevention measures  as well as social support  whereas the coping strategy that they adopted the least was that based on an emotional outlet  Khalid et al   
A recent study on healthcare workers in Hubei  China  during the COVID  epidemic  Cai et al    yielded similar results  to reduce stress  the medical staff tended to rely on active coping strategies  such as using security protocols  practicing social isolation measures  and seeking support from family and friends  but they did not find it necessary to discuss their emotions with a professional 
Huang L  et al 
  found that a sample of nurses working during the COVID  emergency presented greater emotional reactions and turned more to problem focused coping compared with university nursing students 
Emergency workers must have sufficient self efficacy in terms of their coping skills to be able to manage and cope with stress levels 
Self efficacy in coping appears to be an effective protective factor in relation to stress levels and maladaptive responses  Chesney et al   
Self efficacy to cope with traumatic events has been effective in reducing the risk of developing PTSD  Bosmans et al   The main objective of this study is to identify the coping strategies activated by healthcare and emergency workers to deal with stress factors related to the COVID  emergency that may be associated with the risk of developing vicarious or secondary trauma 
Few studies have considered both groups simultaneously when analyzing the strategies they have adopted to manage stress during the COVID  emergency 
Hence  in this study  we are interested in detecting the similarities and differences in the approaches they adopted to manage their stress during the acute phase of the current pandemic According to Walton et al 
  the main acute stress reactions of emergency workers to emergency medical situations are emotional  cognitive  physical  and social reactions 
Therefore  these factors were included in the questionnaire used in the present study 
Moreover  reactions linked to stress factors for difficulties due to ineffective decision making and dealing with stress were also considered  Chesney et al   
In addition  fears regarding contracting the virus and infecting their own families because of COVID  were specifically considered  Du et al    Huang J 
Z  et al    Ornell et al    Walton et al   Based on results found in the literature  the specific objectives of this study are as follows Participants were selected on a voluntary basis through a trasversal sampling in order to take a picture of the situation caused by the pandemic emergency 
We used an internet platform to conduct the study and approached the participants using social media  dedicated mailing lists  and forums 
Participants from all Italian regions completed the questionnaire online 
The sample consists of   participants  males   and   females  whose average age was   years  SD     min   – max  
Further    of the sample were married    were separated  and the remaining   were single 
We selected various professional figures who had directly worked in various sectors during the COVID  emergency and who could be divided into two main groups 
The first  the  Health Group  consists of   participants   who were healthcare workers    doctors     nurses     psychologists   and seven healthcare assistants  
Their average age was   years  SD     and their average years of active professional service was    SD    
The second  the  Emergency Group  consists of   participants     emergency workers     firefighters   and   Civil Protection staff   whose average age was   years  SD     and average years of service was    SD    
There was an age difference between the two groups  t     p   and the distribution of the gender variable differed between the two groups  with   males and   females in the Health Group and   males and   females in the Emergency Group  χ    p    
The study involved participants from the entire national territory  and their workplace could be divided as follows      and   were from North  Central  and South Italy  respectively 
Further    of the sample worked directly with COVID  patients and   worked in specific COVID  departments 
Among the healthcare workers    had worked in direct contact with COVID  patients  whereas among the emergency workers  only   had assisted these patients  χ    p    
In the present study  we included two variables  lack of necessary instructions and lack of PPE  in accordance with the findings in the literature on their impact on the stress reactions of healthcare and emergency workers during the COVID  pandemic 
Among the participants    and   of healthcare and emergency workers  respectively  did not have sufficient instructions to intervene  χ    p n s 
  and   and   of healthcare and emergency workers  respectively  lacked adequate PPE when working  χ    p n s 
 This study used an online questionnaire and was conducted during the lockdown period owing to the COVID  pandemic 
The questionnaire had three parts  one each to collect online informed consent and baseline sociodemographic information  and one with an online series of questionnaires  as described in the next section 
Participants  anonymity was maintained in collecting the data 
The institutional Ethics Committee approved all the procedures This instrument s   items enable verification of the presence of two symptoms of vicarious trauma  Intrusion and Arousal  and their relative frequency 
The STSS was built on the basis of the conceptualization expressed in the DSM   American Psychiatric Association    regarding the characteristic PTSD symptoms 
In detail  the Arousal items describe situations characterized by anxiety  confusion  physical and psychological complaints  and agitation 
Intrusion refers to the re experiencing of the traumatic event even if not directly suffered through internal images and memories 
Instructions for the STSS I indicated that respondents should specify how frequently an item was true for them in the previous   weeks 
The statements are evaluated on a  point scale     never      very often  that provides scores for Intrusion  example items   I thought about my work with victims when I didn t intend to   Reminders of my work with clients upset me  and Arousal  example items   I had trouble concentrating   I was easily annoyed   I expected something bad to happen   I felt jumpy 
The reliability coefficients of the instrument are   and   for Arousal and Intrusion  respectively This is a  item measure of perceived self efficacy for coping with challenges and threats 
This measure focuses on the changes in individuals  confidence in their ability to cope effectively  based on the self efficacy theory  Bandura    Chesney et al   
Participants were asked   When things aren t going well for you  or when you re having problems  how confident or certain are you that you can do the following  Then  they were asked to rate on an  point scale the extent to which they believed they could perform important behaviors for adaptive coping 
The instrument yields three subscale scores   problem focused coping   α      stop unpleasant emotions and thoughts   α     and  support   α    
Anchor points on the scale are    cannot do at all     moderately certain can do  and    certain can do We constructed an ad hoc  item questionnaire that included Yes No questions to detect stress factors identified by the literature  such as the availability of suitable equipment and the receipt of clear instructions during the COVID  coping experience 
In this study  we present the results related to two of these items   Instructions  which refers to having received the necessary instructions to intervene  and  Equipment  which refers to having PPE 
Predictions of these factors have also been made in other studies  Du et al    Walton et al   
In light of the relevance and specificity of the lack of clear information or instructions and adequate PPE in the management of COVID  in the Italian context  as well as the findings in other studies  we decided to focus attention on these two risk factors Our analysis of the literature revealed that in situations in which they have to cope with a pandemic  several factors may affect the stress of medical staff and emergency healthcare workers and that COVID  represents an independent specific stressor  Spoorthy   
These stress factors have been identified as frequently affecting healthcare and emergency workers in emergency situations and leading to physical  emotional  cognitive  decision making  relational  and organizational stress  Del Missier et al    Sbattella    Argentero and Setti    Fraccaroli and Balducci    Bellelli and Di Schiena    Du et al    Walton et al   
Focusing on the specificity of the COVID  epidemic  items have been constructed regarding the fears of contracting the infection and of infecting colleagues or family members  Walton et al    since COVID  represents a factor of independent stress  Spoorthy    that has great impact  Huang J 
Z  et al   
Consequently  we constructed the ESQ consisting of   items assessed on a  point Likert scale  with scores ranging from    not at all  to    very much  grouped into six scales 
The participants were asked to indicate how often they experienced certain emotions and thoughts while performing intervention and emergency activities during the COVID  pandemic The scales correspond to the factors identified and confirmed by factorial analysis through an analysis of the main components with orthogonal rotation of factors  varimax 
The number of factors to be extracted was initially verified through the unit s largest eigenvalue criterion and  subsequently  by the scree test 
The ESQ is based on six scales The ESQ demonstrated good internal consistency  α     overall and for each individual scale  Organizational–Relational Stress  α     Physical Stress  α     Inefficacy Decisional Stress  α     Emotional Stress  α     Cognitive stress  α     and COVID  Stress  α    First  we performed Pearson s correlation analyses to identify the associations between the variables for the two groups that we considered in this study 
Subsequently  we checked for significant differences between the two groups as their stress levels  coping strategies  and secondary trauma 
We used hierarchical linear regression models to verify the predictive effect of the risk factors  lack of adequate information and PPE  on the different stress levels  in step  
Then  we verified the protective effect of the coping strategies  in step  
The models were controlled for age  gender  and group 
Lastly  we used hierarchical regression models to verify the predictive effect of stress factors on the components of secondary trauma 
The models were controlled for age  gender  and group First  we conducted correlational analyses and comparisons of averages on the reference sample 
Table   shows the correlations between the scales of the ESQ and the other instruments Preliminary comparisons were made through the Student s t test between the Health Group and the Emergency Group in relation to the ESQ  CSES SF  and STSS I scores 
Table   shows the comparison between the two groups As shown in Table   significant differences emerged between the two groups in relation to their Stress and Arousal levels 
The results indicate higher levels of both for the Health Group  and that emergency workers turn more to the Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts strategy 
Further  we performed comparisons with reference to the gender variable to detect differences in the levels of stress factors  coping strategies  and secondary trauma 
Females reported significantly higher Physical Stress than males did  Females  M     SD     Males  M     SD     t     p     as well as Emotional Stress  Females  M     SD     Males  M     SD     t     p     and COVID  Stress  Females  M     SD     Males  M     SD     t     p    
No gender difference emerged in coping strategies and secondary trauma 
Within the Health Group  there were significant differences regarding Inefficacy Decisional Stress  F     p     Doctor M     SD     Psychologist M     SD     average difference     p     and COVID  Stress  F     p     Nurse M     SD     Doctor M     SD     difference     p    
Within the Emergency Group  there were no differences in levels of stress and secondary trauma or coping strategies 
Moreover  we found similar correlations between the two groups for the Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts strategy and the stress factors  whereas for the other two coping strategies  we found a different association  particularly for the Emergency Group 
However  the t test comparisons highlight differences only at the level of the Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts strategy 
Given the findings of the preliminary analyses  we considered it necessary to include the age  gender  and group variables to test the predictiveness of the coping strategies on the participants  stress levels To test the predictive effect of the coping strategies on various levels of stress  hierarchical regression was conducted 
Considering the Age and Gender differences within the groups  we included these variables in all models together with the Group variable  Health vs 
Emergency  and the  Instructions  and  Equipment  variables 
The models generated by assuming the ESQ scales as dependent variables are shown in Table  
Regarding the coping strategies  we observed an important effect of the Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts Coping strategy on all the stress scales  except for Physical Stress where the effect of the Focused Problem Coping strategy is recorded As shown in Table   significant negative associations between stressors and secondary trauma were found for both groups 
The hierarchical regression models of stress scales were analyzed for the Arousal and Intrusion levels of secondary trauma 
The models included the Age  Gender  Health Emergency Group variables  and the ESQ scales 
The results are shown in Table  The same regression models were generated by including coping strategies as predictors and were analyzed by Age  Gender  and Health Emergency Group 
Compared with Arousal  the Health Emergency Group and Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts are predictive  R    F     p     Beta  ∗∗∗  Beta  ∗  respectively 
Compared with Intrusion  only the Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts variable  R    F     p     Beta  ∗  assumes significance This study has several limitations 
The first is the limited sample size 
The second is that our study involved participants in the very midst of the COVID  emergency  which means that the level of stress in healthcare workers may have been more severe and acute 
Moreover  the long term psychological implications for the healthcare and emergency population should be investigated for the presence of a full secondary trauma 
Therefore  a large sized longitudinal study is called for to further explore the pathogenesis of vicarious traumatization 
The third is that participants were not selected based on whether they had existing psychological problems 
In proposing the hypothesis of this study  we anticipated that we would be able to discover the relationships between coping strategies  emergency related stress  and secondary trauma in healthcare and emergency workers and commenced our investigation by assuming that the impact of stress can provoke psychological consequences in emergency situations 
In future work  this assumption could be tested to verify whether an emergency situation has a different impact on workers who have already experienced psychological problems The raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors  without undue reservation  to any qualified researcher The studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by Comitato Etico per la Sperimentazione Umana – CESU of the University of Urbino

As reported by some  the association of acute kidney injury  AKI  and COVID  has a high mortality   
However  the incidence of reported AKI associated with COVID  varies widely             
It would be expected that kidney involvement is frequent since the virus enters the cell through the angiotensin converting enzyme    ACE  which is expressed  in addition to pulmonary type   alveolar cells  on renal proximal tubular cells  glomerular visceral and parietal epithelium  and the cytoplasm of the distal tubules and collecting ducts         
In addition  COVID  induces hemodynamic instability and severe inflammation  which  in addition to direct renal infection  can induce acute tubular necrosis  ATN 
We report our experience with AKI in COVID  patients in an inner city  predominantly minority  and a low socioeconomic group and compare our experience with other studies in significantly different cohorts of patients 
We identify the incidence  risk factors  and prognosis of AKI and thus provide a broader understanding of this complication in a group of patients not specifically reported upon to date All adult patients   years of age admitted to the Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center with COVID  infection from March   through April     were studied in this retrospective analysis done in a single medical center serving a low income minority population in Brooklyn  NY 
It was one of the single centers with the most admissions of COVID  patients 
COVID  infection was diagnosed based on clinical presentation  radiographic lung abnormalities  and a positive result of real time PCR 
We excluded COVID  patients from our study if they were on maintenance hemodialysis or were renal transplant recipients 
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Brookdale Hospital and did not require patient consent because of its retrospective design We collected the demographics  the presenting clinical symptoms when available  prior medical history including outpatient medications and prior level of renal function  comorbidities  and in hospital laboratory data from the electronic medical record  Epic Hyperspace   
Laboratory data consisted of complete blood count  hemostasis parameters  renal and liver function  PF ratio  arterial oxygen partial pressure  PaO  fractional inspired oxygen  FiO   creatinine kinase  lactate dehydrogenase  and inflammatory markers including high sensitivity C reactive protein  hs CRP  ferritin  and D dimer 
Normal range of these measures was provided by our laboratory The Kidney Disease  Improving Global Outcome  KDIGO    definition was used to identify AKI 
Estimated glomerular filtration rate  eGFR  on admission was taken as baseline eGFR and was divided into   and ≥  mL min  m 
eGFR was estimated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study  MDRD  equation 
The earliest day of the serum creatinine change that met the KDIGO criteria for AKI was selected as day   of AKI 
The peak serum creatinine value was used to determine the stage of AKI  with an increase in the serum creatinine of  –   –  and   times the baseline serum creatinine defined as AKI stages     and   respectively Continuous variables were described as mean   standard deviation for normally distributed data  or median and interquartile range  IQR  values for non normal distribution 
Categorical variables were presented as frequency and percentage 
The mean of continuous variables was compared by using independent t tests  the Wilcoxon rank sum test  and the Kruskal Wallis test  across the stages of AKI 
The proportion of categorical variables was compared by using χ  test 
Fischer s exact test was used when there were only limited data available 
The Kaplan Meier method  log rank test  was used to determine the cumulative incidence of in hospital mortality 
We used the Cox proportional hazard  PH  regression to determine the association of kidney disease indicators and in hospital mortality 
The assumptions of the Cox PH model were checked using the Schoenfeld residuals  and no violations of the assumptions were present 
In the multivariable analysis  separate Cox PH models were used to determine the association of baseline eGFR and blood urea nitrogen  BUN  on admission  proteinuria  hematuria  and stages of AKI with in hospital mortality since these variables showed a highly significant correlation 
Variables for Cox PH regression were selected using stepwise regression 
Variables with α level of risk factor   were entered into the model 
While evaluating the association of hematuria and proteinuria with in hospital mortality by the Cox PH model  patients with missing values  n     were excluded from the analysis 
All statistical analyses were performed using the STATA version   software and a p value of   was used to determine statistical significance In this study    adult confirmed cases of COVID  were initially reviewed 
Patients on maintenance hemodialysis  n     were excluded from the study and   patients were used for the analysis 
Baseline characteristics of these patients are shown in Table  
  of our cohort were African Americans and   were Hispanics 
The median age of the patients was   years  IQR  –  and   of them were male 
Most of these patients presented with dyspnea   cough   and fever  
  of the patients had a systolic blood pressure below   mm Hg at presentation 
   n     of all patients were mechanically ventilated during the hospitalization 
The median values of ferritin  D dimer  hs CRP  creatinine kinase and lactose dehydrogenase were elevated above their reference ranges  see online suppl

The development of AKI was seen earlier in the course in patients with an eGFR   mL min  m  at presentation   vs    and occurred within   h of admission 
Patients who developed AKI during the hospitalization were more likely to have a systolic blood pressure of   mm Hg at presentation and a lesser PF ratio and were more likely to be intubated during the course of hospitalization  Table  
Eighteen out of   patients with documented chronic kidney disease  CKD  prior to admission developed AKI during the hospitalization

Table  The number of patients requiring renal replacement therapy  RRT  during the hospitalization was  
This represented   of all patients and   of those with AKI 
All the patients who required RRT by definition had stage   AKI 
The modalities of RRT were continuous RRT in   patients   of all those who required RRT  and intermittent hemodialysis in   patients  
Two patients   required both modalities of RRT 
    out of   of those patients who required mechanical ventilation developed AKI compared with     out of   of nonventilated patients 
Of these   patients      required RRT 
The majority of AKI stage   patients requiring RRT were on mechanical ventilation   out of   requiring RRT 
  of the patients who were treated with RRT   out of   patients  died during the hospitalization 
Of those with stage   AKI who were not dialyzed    died

Hematuria of   to   was found by urine dipstick in   of AKI patients  while proteinuria of   to   was detected in   of the patients with AKI Overall  the in hospital mortality was   in COVID  patients 
The in hospital mortality was significantly higher in patients with an eGFR   mL min  m    than in patients with an eGFR ≥  mL min  m    at presentation 
The in hospital mortality of AKI patients was     out of   who developed AKI died   Table  A significantly higher in hospital mortality was observed in patients with an eGFR   mL min  m  at presentation  elevated BUN at presentation  and in hospital AKI using the Kaplan Meier analysis  Fig

There was no significant association between in hospital mortality and proteinuria and or hematuria  Table  AKI is common among hospitalized patients  incidence  –  and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality       
In our cohort of   COVID  patients  a relatively higher percentage of patients     of   developed in hospital AKI 
Current evidence suggests that AKI in COVID  patients is a result of an interplay of virus mediated injury  a dysregulated inflammatory response  angiotensin II pathway activation  hypercoagulation  and microangiopathy   
These COVID specific factors likely interact with the other known risk factors for AKI  such as hemodynamic instability  hypoxia  and sepsis  which increased over time 
The increase in the cumulative incidence of AKI over time in our cohort is likely associated with concomitant clinical deterioration and less likely represent a unique renal effect of COVID 
Compared to studies of AKI in COVID  patients from other countries  we found our incidence to be higher than that reported from   Asian countries  –  and is similar to that in an Italian study             
However  it is lower than that in the more recent report by Hirsch et al 
  who detailed their experience in   academic and community hospitals in metropolitan New York   none of which are located in the inner city  lower socioeconomic neighborhoods with a predominant minority population 
As compared with the above cited studies  the incidence of stage   AKI   was highest in our cohort 
It is not possible to determine with certainty the cause s  of this wide variation 
However  we did note a higher prevalence of comorbid conditions in our group 
For example  Cheng et al 
  reported a   incidence of AKI  with a   prevalence of HTN and a   prevalence of DM in their study population 
In our cohort  roughly twice as many   had HTN  and more than   times as many   were diabetic  Table  
Also  the incidence of severe lung involvement that required mechanical ventilation was lower   than ours    Table  
Mechanical ventilation per se has been reported to be strongly associated with AKI   
In our cohort  the incidence of AKI was also higher among those requiring mechanical ventilation  We identified various risk factors for AKI in our study  Tables    
Similar to previous reports  our patients with AKI were more likely to be male  have a history of HTN  and have severe respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation     
In our study  higher BMI increased the likelihood of developing severe AKI 
A low eGFR at presentation more than doubled the risk of developing AKI  p      Table  
Patients with lower eGFR had a significantly higher cumulative incidence of AKI than those with eGFR   mL min  m   p     Fig 
 
Thus  there was a synergistic effect of reduced baseline kidney function and subsequent AKI 
We did not find an association between diabetes and in hospital AKI The role of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors  ACEi  in COVID  is a subject of ongoing debate 
ACEi can increase the expression of ACE  the receptor used by SARS CoV  to enter target cells     
However  ACE  has been shown to be beneficial in acute respiratory distress syndrome when replaced     
This possible protective effect is attributed to the degradation of proinflammatory angiotensin II to angiotensin by ACE 
At present  it remains unclear if ACEi facilitate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus    SARS CoV  cellular entry and intracellular virus replication and whether ACEi improve acute respiratory distress syndrome outcomes 
In our cohort  the use of ACEi was significantly higher in patients with a lower admitting eGFR  Table   and in those who experienced AKI  Table  
We found a similar association between AKI and non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs  but not with angiotensin II receptor blockers  ARBs  in our cohort  Table  
Further studies are necessary to delineate the relationship between ACEi  angiotensin II receptor blockers  and COVID  outcomes Markers of acute inflammation  ferritin and CRP  muscle injury  creatinine kinase  myocardial injury  and D dimer levels were significantly higher in patients with a low eGFR at presentation  online suppl 
Table   and in those with AKI  online suppl 
Table   suggesting causality by a dysregulated immune inflammatory response  the so called  cytokine storm We found an extremely high incidence of mortality in our study cohort 
High presenting BUN and low eGFR   mL min  m  were significantly associated with increased mortality  Table  
AKI was significantly associated with increased mortality 
The mortality risk was highest in stage   AKI  HR   CI  –   Table

Mortality rose concurrently with the AKI stages      and   for stages     and   respectively  Table  
These rates were over   and  fold higher than those reported by Hirsch et al 
    AKI    in non AKI 
However  our cohort s high mortality is similar to the findings of John Hopkins University and the American Community Survey 
They reported a   and  fold higher COVID  infection and mortality rate in predominantly African American counties than in predominantly white counties   
Wadhera et al 
  also reported a death rate of   per   in Brooklyn  about   higher than that of Manhattan 
Moreover  in New York City  current age adjusted mortality is highest among African Americans and about   times that of whites   Our hospital provides medical services for an ethnic minority and a low income population in the most impoverished neighborhood in Brooklyn  where   of the residents live below the Federal Poverty Level as per a   report   
  of our patients identified themselves as African Americans 
In comparison  in the study by Hirsch et al 
     identified themselves as whites  and only   identified themselves as African Americans 
The high representation of ethnic minorities in our study population may have contributed to the increased mortality 
This association has been widely publicized and is likely the result of a complex interplay of multiple factors 
These include  but are not limited to  a high burden of comorbidities  genetics  the pernicious influence of adverse socioeconomic determinants of health  the absence of the privilege to work from home  and the ability to follow the recommended social distancing   In our cohort      of the   patients with AKI required RRT 
Nineteen out of these   patients   were mechanically ventilated 
Thus  almost all of the additional requirements for acute dialysis during the COVID  pandemic at our institution were in intensive care units 
Overall      out of   of mechanically ventilated patients required RRT 
Elevated ferritin was associated with an increased risk of all stages of AKI and the need for RRT  online suppl 
Table  
Among those who received RRT      died versus     in the stage   AKI group who did not undergo RRT  p      Table  
Thus  there was no statistically significant improvement in survival  and the mortality remained extremely high in both the RRT and non RRT groups 
These findings should prompt the early involvement of a palliative care team to define goals of care in patients with COVID  disease and stage   AKI In our experience  ultrafiltration was not well tolerated 
It often increased pressor requirements and did little to improve the ventilatory status 
We observed a high incidence of hypercoagulability and frequent clotting of the dialysis filters  lines  and catheters 
Thus  the patients required higher than the usual doses of heparin Our study has limitations 
Although     of the study population had a low eGFR on admission  only     had a documented history of CKD 
Data were collected retrospectively from medical records and often did not have information regarding prior renal function 
Patients also may have had an elevated creatinine on admission secondary to AKI suffered prior to hospitalization 
If so  we may have underestimated the true overall incidence of COVID associated AKI 
It is not possible to rectify this problem  given the data at our disposal Our study is a single center study  with the majority of the study population identifying themselves as African Americans or Hispanics 
This limits our study s general applicability but provides a unique insight into this population and broadens our understanding of COVID  disease 
Data were missing on many patients at different stages of the hospitalization since they were collected retrospectively 
Importantly  little data were available regarding urine output  a defining characteristic of AKI 
With this lack of information  we may have again underestimated the true incidence of AKI Nevertheless  even with the above limitations of our study  the high incidence of AKI and its negative impact upon survival is abundantly clear 
In response to the high incidence of AKI in our patients with COVID  we increased our capacity to deliver RRT 
These efforts included the purchase of additional machines and dialysis solutions  additional staff training  and engineering alterations to allow dialysis on the general medical floors 
Also  we increased our stockpiles of catheters  filters  and dialysis solutions for intermittent and continuous RRT 
We also plan to establish a peritoneal dialysis program to further strengthen our acute dialysis capacity In conclusion  our data report explicitly upon a high proportion of ethnic minority patients in an inner city  severely economically deprived neighborhood  previously not studied 
Our patients experienced a high incidence of AKI and an extremely high mortality  especially in AKI stage  
Unfortunately  RRT provided little survival benefit 
Policy changes and planning in preparation for this high incidence of AKI in COVID  patients are necessary at the local and national levels Study was approved by Institutional Review Board  IRB  Brookdale Hospital The authors have no conflicts of interests to declare The authors did not receive any funding U Z

  supervisor Dynamic changes in computed tomography manifestations of   patients
with novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan  ChinaDuring the first week of December   a few cases of pneumonia caused by a novel
coronavirus appeared in Wuhan  Hubei Province  China 
The patients had a history of
visiting the nearby Huanan seafood market  where wild animals were sold  With the spread of the disease  such cases have also been found in other
parts of China and abroad 
As of   July     cases have been confirmed
worldwide  including   deaths and   recoveries The novel coronavirus was originally named   novel coronavirus  nCoV  it was
recently officially renamed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus  
 SARS CoV  by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses 
The disease
caused by SARS CoV  has been named coronavirus disease    COVID  by the World
Health Organization 
Like SARS CoV  SARS CoV  likely originated in bats  however 
the intermediary animal host remains unclear 
The nearest neighbor of the  nCoV
isolates from China is a bat SARS like coronavirus  Bat SL CoVZC SARS CoV  carries a high risk of human to human transmission  and such transmission
has been reported in family clusters and among medical workers  The main route of transmission
is respiratory droplets and contact transmission  the virus may also be transmitted
through the conjunctiva and via aerosols  Current epidemiological surveys indicate that the latency period generally
ranges from   to   days  with a maximum of   days 
Affected patients present with
pneumonia like symptoms  including fever  fatigue  cough  expectoration 
pharyngalgia  anorexia  and myalgia 
Some patients also have gastrointestinal
symptoms  including diarrhea  nausea  vomiting  and abdominal pain 
In severe cases 
patients may rapidly develop acute respiratory distress syndrome  septic shock 
difficult to correct metabolic acidosis  and coagulation dysfunction Increasing numbers of studies are suggesting the high clinical value of imaging
examinations  especially high resolution computed tomography  HRCT  of the chest  in
patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia –  Typical CT imaging
manifestations include multiple patchy subsegmental or segmental ground glass
opacities  GGOs  and consolidation in the bilateral lungs  The imaging manifestations in patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia often
change rapidly  and many patients thus undergo repeated CT examinations 
Some
patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia gradually improve  whereas others develop
persistent hypoxemia or dyspnea and gradually worsen 
The changes in the patient s
condition are often closely related to the severity of the lung lesions 
Therefore 
observing the evolution of the lung lesions by chest CT is very important to assess
and predict the patient s outcome This study was to performed observe the changes in the chest HRCT manifestations of
  patients with pneumonia caused by SARS CoV  from the time of the initial
diagnosis 
To our knowledge  this is the largest population evaluated to date among
studies of the dynamic changes in imaging manifestations of novel coronavirus
pneumonia Consecutive patients were retrospectively enrolled in this single center study
from   January   to   February  
These patients met the Diagnosis and
Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia  trial version   issued by the National
Health Commission of the People s Republic of China  and their diagnoses were confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction 
According to the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus
Pneumonia  trial version   issued by the Chinese National Health Committee 
patients who developed severe pneumonia during their disease course were
excluded 
Severe pneumonia was defined as severe respiratory distress
 respiratory rate of   breaths minute  a requirement for oxygen treatment
or mechanical ventilation  an oxygen saturation of   on room air  a
partial arterial oxygen pressure fraction of inspired oxygen ratio of ≤  mmHg 
shock  or pneumonia combined with other organ failure All patients were examined using a Discovery CT  HD scanner  GE Healthcare 
Chicago  IL  USA  during a single inspiratory phase 
Before the examination  the
medical staff guided the patient to hold his or her breath and inhale 
After
complete exhalation  the patient held his or her breath  and a CT scan was
performed from the bottom of the lung to the apex of the lung 
The tube voltage
was   kVp with automatic tube current modulation 
The scan time was   s  the
scan interval was   mm  and the scan layer thickness was   mm 
After scanning 
adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction of   and the standard algorithm
were adopted  and the reconstruction layer thickness was   mm 
No contrast
agent was used during the CT scan 
Most patients underwent multiple chest CT
examinations  largely because the clinicians were still unclear about the
evolution tendencies of the lung lesions associated with COVID  pneumonia 
Additionally  some patients had symptoms such as hypoxemia or dyspnea due to
rapid disease progression 
Therefore  multiple chest CT examinations were
required to observe the progress or absorption of pneumonia The major CT manifestations were described using internationally standard
nomenclature defined by the Fleischner Society glossary  using terms such as
GGO  consolidation  and fibrous strips  A semi quantitative scoring system was used to estimate the pulmonary
involvement of all of these abnormalities on the basis of the area involved  Each of the five lung lobes was visually scored from   to   as follows 
  no involvement      involvement      to   involvement      to
  involvement      to   involvement  and     involvement 
The
total CT score was the sum of the individual lobar scores and ranged from    no
involvement  to    maximum involvement 
The number of affected lung lobes was
also recorded 
The images were transferred to an AW  workstation  GE
Healthcare  and anonymized 
All images were evaluated by two radiologists with
more than   years of work experience  and the final scores were determined by
consensus Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS Statistics for Windows  Version
   SPSS Inc  Chicago  IL  USA 
Measurement data are expressed as
mean   standard deviation  minimum–maximum  and categorical data are presented
as the percentage of the group 
A P value of   was defined as
statistically significant In total    CT scans of   patients   men    women  with confirmed COVID 
were collected 
The patients  ages ranged from   to   years  and their mean
age was       years 
Fever was the most common symptom  Table  
The patients
underwent        –  chest CT examinations  and the interval between the
first and last scan was       days  –  days The laboratory results are presented in Table  
Most laboratory results were
normal  with mildly elevated concentrations of C reactive protein
      mg L  D dimers       mg L  and ferritin      
µg L Based on clinical experience  five stages were identified from the onset of
initial symptoms  Stage A  –  days  n     Stage B  –  days  n     Stage
C  –  days  n     Stage D  –  days  n     and Stage E   days 
n    
One patient had a  day history of cough with fever and was in Stage B
at the time of admission 
The frequencies of different lesions in different
stages are presented in Table  
Two patients in Stage A and one patient in Stage E had no
lesions 
Multiple lobes were involved in most of the CT scans in all stages 
Multiple lobe involvement was present in     patients in Stage A   
  in Stage B      in Stage C      in Stage D  and    
in Stage E  GGOs could be seen in all stages  and the proportion of GGOs in each
stage was similar 
The proportion of consolidation first increased and then
decreased over time 
GGOs and consolidation were present in     and  
  patients in Stage A      and     in Stage B     
and     in Stage C      and     in Stage D  and    
and     in Stage E  respectively 
The consolidations in some cases were
absorbed As shown in Table  
the total CT score also first increased and then decreased over time  and the
total CT score of pulmonary involvement was significantly higher in Stage B than
in Stage A       vs        respectively  P    
Additionally  the
total CT score of lung involvement was significantly higher in Stage C than in
Stages B and D       vs         P     and       vs       
 P     respectively 
The number of involved lobes was significantly higher
in Stage B than in Stage A       vs        respectively  P    
Notably  the CT score of the lower lobe was significantly higher than the
corresponding upper and middle lobes in Stages A  B  C  and D  P     for
all 
In Stage E  the CT score of the right lower lobe was significantly higher
than that of the right upper middle lobes  P     and P    
respectively  whereas no significant difference was observed in the CT score
between the left lower lobe and left upper lobe The CT images of a patient with novel coronavirus pneumonia are shown in Figure  
GGOs and
consolidation first increased from Stage A to Stage C  after which the
consolidation gradually absorbed  the GGOs then gradually decreased in Stages D
and E Since the end of   an outbreak of a novel pneumonia in Wuhan has been drawing
tremendous attention around the world 
Chinese government officials and researchers
have taken swift measures to control the outbreak and conduct etiological studies 
The causative agent of this pneumonia has been identified as SARS CoV  a novel
coronavirus 
As its name suggests  its genetic structure is   similar to that of SARS CoV The most frequently affected organ of the novel coronavirus is the lung 
In the
previous version of the diagnosis and treatment guideline for pneumonia caused by
novel coronavirus  the diagnosis was confirmed by the presence of viral nucleic
acids in throat swabs  sputum  and alveolar lavage fluid 
However  the more recent
guideline indicates that if typical chest CT findings are observed in patients
suspected to have COVID  the patient should be clinically diagnosed 
This
reflects the important role of chest CT in the diagnosis 
Moreover  current clinical
experience is showing that the chest CT manifestations change rapidly 
Therefore 
many patients in the present study underwent multiple repeated examinations during
treatment 
To our knowledge  this study is by far the largest case series of
follow up imaging among patients with COVID SARS CoV  infects human respiratory epithelial cells through S protein and has a
strong infection capacity for humans 
Coronavirus particles have a diameter of   to
  nm and can directly reach the bottom of the lung 
Because of lung volume and
gravity  respiratory airflow  and other factors  the type II alveolar epithelial
cells present at the bottom of the lung become the target cells of the coronavirus 
Therefore  the lesions are mainly distributed under the pleura or along the vascular
bronchial bundle  After the alveolar epithelial cells have become combined with the virus  the
alveolar wall is damaged and large numbers of immune cells and lymphocytes
accumulate  resulting in swelling around the lung leaflets and blood vessel
congestion 
The pulmonary lobules merge with each other  forming nodular or patchy
GGOs 
As the disease progresses  multiple lung segments become involved  the scope
of the lesion expands  the alveolar wall shrinks and collapses  and the exfoliated
and necrotic epithelium and the exuded inflammatory cells form a hyaline membrane 
These changes manifest as coexisting imaging abnormalities such as GGOs  nodules 
consolidation  and fibrous cord strips Several studies have focused on the evolution of CT changes in patients with COVID 
pneumonia 
Pan et al  analyzed the disease course according to  day stages and found that the CT
score was the highest on days   to   of the disease course  after   days  the CT
score of the lower lung was significantly higher than that of the middle and upper
lungs 
Zhou et al  found that CT images of patients with COVID  pneumonia showed a
predominantly peripheral  middle  lower  and posterior distribution 
The early rapid
progressive stage was   to   days from symptom onset  the advanced stage with peak
levels of CT abnormalities occurred from   to   days  and the abnormalities started
to improve after   days 
Lei et al  reported that patients with COVID  pneumonia had a typical transition from
the early stage to the advanced stage and then from the advanced stage to the
dissipating stage 
Single or multiple GGOs were distributed along the
bronchovascular or subpleural regions in the pulmonary parenchyma in the early
stage  higher density consolidations were observed in the advanced stage  and the
GGOs and consolidations were absorbed in the dissipating stage 
Xiang et al  evaluated only six patients with COVID  pneumonia and reported that the CT
score peaked at   to   days and that the CT scores of the lower lobes were
significantly higher than those of the middle upper lobes after   days from disease
onset 
These findings were consistent with those reported by Pan et al  Liang et al  reported that the majority of patients had involvement of three or more
lobes 
Bilateral involvement was more prevalent than unilateral involvement 
The
proportions of patients observed to have pure GGOs or GGOs and consolidation
decreased over time  while the proportion of patients with GGOs and linear opacities
increased 
The total severity score showed an increasing trend in the first   weeks 
Bernheim et al  divided the disease course into three stages  –   –  and  –  days  and
found that   of patients in the first stage had normal CT findings 
As the time
since onset of symptoms increased  the CT abnormalities became more frequent  these
findings included consolidation  bilateral and peripheral disease  greater total
lung involvement  linear opacities  the  crazy paving  pattern  and the  reverse
halo  sign In this study  we evaluated the CT findings of   patients with COVID  pneumonia
confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction 
The patients underwent
a mean of        range   –  chest CT examinations 
At present  the course of
COVID  pneumonia and when patients should be re examined remain inconclusive 
As
mentioned above  different studies have staged the disease according to different
time periods 
We grouped the patients  CT scans at different time intervals 
The
time interval grouping was based on current clinical experience and is consistent
with the imaging interval described in the pneumonia diagnosis and treatment guidelines  This grouping is also partially similar to that described by Pan et al  and Zhou et al  Multiple lobe involvement was observed in most patients in all stages  and
lower lobe lesions were significantly more common than upper and middle lobe
lesions  this is also consistent with the findings reported by Pan et al  and Liang et al  As mentioned above  most studies have suggested that patients with COVID 
pneumonia undergo a typical transition from the early stage to the advanced stage
and then from the advanced stage to the dissipating stage  however  the time to
reach the peak of the disease course varies among different studies  and the
patients in our study showed a similar tendency 
GGOs and consolidation were the
common chest CT manifestations  the proportion of GGOs in each stage was similar 
while consolidation and the total CT score first increased and then decreased over
time 
The total CT score was significantly higher in Stage B than in Stage A  while
the total CT score was significantly higher in Stage C than in Stage B 
These
findings suggest that the lung lesions of most patients significantly improved after
  days and that most patients with new coronavirus pneumonia had a disease course
of more than   days This study had three main limitations 
First  we did not consider the effects of
factors such as age  sex  medical history  including hypertension  hyperlipidemia 
hyperglycemia  and malignant tumors  and lifestyle habits  including smoking and
drinking history  on patient outcomes 
Second  although   patients with novel
coronavirus pneumonia were included in this study  the number of patients in Stages
B to E was limited 
Future studies should include more patients and extend the
observation time to ensure that the study results are more representative 
Third 
some studies have suggested that factors such as age  the C reactive protein
concentration  and the interleukin  β concentration may be related to patient
outcomes 
However  we did not perform a correlation analysis between the laboratory
data and patient outcomes In conclusion  we followed up and evaluated   chest CT scans of   patients with
confirmed COVID  pneumonia and found that most patients had a disease course of
more than   days and that the lung lesions of most patients improved significantly
after   days 
The purpose of this study is to help clinicians better understand the
disease course and properly perform chest CT re examinations for patients with
COVID  pneumonia to minimize the radiation dose Recombination Every Day  Abundant Recombination in a Virus during a Single Multi Cellular Host InfectionAs increasing numbers of full length viral sequences become available  recombinant or mosaic viruses are being recognized more frequently   
Recombination events have been demonstrated to be associated with viruses expanding their host range   or increasing their virulence    thus accompanying  or perhaps even being at the origin of  major changes during virus adaptation 
It remains unclear  however  whether recombination events represent a highly frequent and significant phenomenon in the everyday life of these viruses Viruses can exchange genetic material when at least two different viral genomes co infect the same host cell 
Progeny can then become hybrid through different mechanisms  such as reassortment of segments when the parental genomes are fragmented    intra molecular recombination when polymerases switch templates  in RNA viruses     or homologous or non homologous recombination  in both RNA and DNA viruses 
Quantification of viral recombination in multi cellular organisms has been attempted under two distinct experimental approaches  in vitro  in cell cultures     and in vivo  in live hosts    
The in vitro approach  which has so far been applied only to animal viruses  allows the establishment of the  intrinsic  recombination rate in experimentally co infected cells in cell cultures   
However  it does not necessarily reflect the situation in entire  living hosts  where the frequency of co infected cells is poorly known and depends on many factors such as the size of the pathogen population  the relative frequency and distribution of the different variants  and host defense mechanisms preventing secondary infection of cells 
The in vivo experimental approach is closer to biological conditions and may thus be more informative of what actually happens in  the real world However  as discussed below  numerous experimental constraints have so far precluded an actual quantification of the baseline rate of recombination 
First  many experimental designs have used extreme positive selection  where only recombinant genomes were viable  e g    
Other studies did not use complementation techniques but detected recombinants by PCR within infected hosts or tissues    which provides information on their presence but not on their frequency in the viral population 
So far  no quantitative PCR or other quantitative method has been applied to evaluate the number of recombinants appearing in an experimentally infected live host 
Finally  recent methods based on sequence analysis inferred the population recombination rate  rather than the individual recombination rate   
While results from these methods certainly take in vivo recombination into account  there are other caveats  isolates have often been collected in different hosts sometimes in different geographical regions and sometimes the selective neutrality of sequence variation on which these estimates are based is not clearly established 
Estimates from such studies by essence address the estimation of the recombination rate at a different evolutionary scale Taken together  the currently available information indicates that no viral recombination rate has ever been estimated directly at time and space scales corresponding to a single multi cellular host infection  although this level is most significant for the biology and evolution of viruses 
This study intends to fill this gap by evaluating the recombination frequency of the cauliflower mosaic virus  CaMV  during a single passage in one of its host plants  the turnip Brassica rapa CaMV is a pararetrovirus  which is a major grouping containing hepadnaviruses  e g  hepatitis B virus  badnaviruses  e g  banana streak virus  and caulimoviruses  e g  CaMV 
Pararetroviruses are characterized by a non segmented double stranded DNA genome 
After entering the host cell nucleus  the viral DNA accumulates as a minichromosome   whose transcription is ensured by the host RNA polymerase II   
The CaMV genome consists in approximately   bp and encodes six viral gene products that have been detected in planta  Figure     
Viral proteins P  to P  are expressed from two major transcripts  namely a  S RNA  encoding P  and a  S RNA corresponding to the entire genome and serving as mRNA for proteins P –P    
Using the pre genomic  S RNA as a matrix  the protein P   product of gene V  reverse transcribes the genome into genomic DNA that is concomitantly encapsidated   The detection of CaMV recombinants in turnip hosts has been reported numerous times 
Some studies have demonstrated the appearance of infectious recombinant viral genomes after inoculation  i  of a host plant with two infectious or non infectious parental clones   or  ii  of a transgenic plant containing one CaMV transgene with a CaMV genome missing the corresponding genomic region   
While the former revealed inter genomic viral recombination  the latter demonstrated that CaMV can also recombine with transgenes within the host s genome 
Another study based on phylogenetic analyses of various CaMV strains has clearly suggested different origins for different genomic regions and  hence  multiple recombination events during the evolution of this virus   
Indirect experimental evidence has indicated that  in some cases  CaMV recombination could occur within the host nucleus  between different viral minichromosomes  presumably through the action of the DNA repair cellular machinery   
Nevertheless  the mechanism of  template switching  during reverse transcription  predominant in all retroviruses  most certainly also applies to pararetroviruses 
For this reason  and on the basis of numerous experimental data  CaMV is generally believed to recombine mostly in the cytoplasm of the host cell  by  legal  template switching between two pre genomic RNA molecules    or  illegal  template switching between the  S and the  S RNA   
Under this hypothesis  recombination in CaMV could therefore be considered as operating on a linear template during reverse transcription  with the  ′ and  ′ extremities later ligated to circularize the genomic DNA  position   in Figure  
The above cited studies clearly demonstrate that CaMV is able to recombine 
However  since these studies are based on complementation techniques  non quantitative detection  or phylogenetically based inferences of recombination  they do not inform us on whether recombination is an exceptional event or an  everyday  process shaping the genetic composition of CaMV populations In the present work  we aimed at answering this question 
To this end  we have constructed a CaMV genome with four genetic markers  demonstrated to be neutral in competition experiments 
By co inoculating host plants with equal amounts of wild type and marker containing CaMV particles  we have generated mixed populations in which impressive proportions of recombinants distributed in several different classes corresponding to exchange of different genomic regions have been detected and quantified 
Altogether  the recombinant genomes averaged over   of the population 
Further analysis of these data  assuming a number of viral replications during the infection period ranging from five to   indicates that the per nucleotide per replication cycle recombination rate of CaMV is of the same order of magnitude  i e  on the order of a few   across the entire genome 
We thereby provide the first quantification  to our knowledge  of the recombination rate in a virus population during a single passage in a single host From Figure   and supposing that all marker containing genomic regions can recombine  we could predict the detection and quantification of seven classes of recombinant genotypes   bcd a  a cd b  ab d c  abc d   cd ab  a d bc  and a c b d 
Indeed  all classes were detected  and their frequencies in the ten CaMV populations analyzed are summarized in Table  Altogether  the proportion of recombinant genomes found in the mixed viral populations was astonishingly high and very similar in the ten co infected plants analyzed  Table   last column  ranging between    plant   to    plants     and   with a mean frequency   standard error  of      
This result indicates that recombination events are very frequent during the invasion of the host plant by CaMV and represents  to our knowledge  the first direct quantification of viral recombination during the infection of a live multi cellular host The inferred per generation recombination and interference rates  assuming that CaMV undergoes ten replication cycles during the   d between infection and sampling  are given for each of the ten plants in Table  
Recombination rates between adjacent markers are large  on the order of   to  
Taking the distance in nucleotides between markers into account yields an average recombination rate per nucleotide and generation on the order of      
Interestingly  this recombination rate does not vary throughout the genome  Kruskal–Wallis test  p    To relax the assumption of the number of replications during the   d  we calculated the recombination parameters assuming five or   generations 
The effect of the number of generations on the estimates is linear  doubling the number of generations results in a halving of the recombination rate  detailed results not shown 
For example  the average recombination rates r
  r
  and r
  assuming   generations were equal to     and   respectively  compare with values in Table   yielding per nucleotide per generation recombination rates of             and      Inspection of Table   also shows that first order interference coefficients were in general negative  indicating that a crossing over in one genomic segment increases the probability that a crossing over will occur in another genomic segment  while the second order coefficient parameter had an average value close to zero with a large variance 
The mechanism leading to these results will be discussed in the following section One major breakthrough in the work presented here lies in the space and time scales at which the experiments were performed 
Indeed  the processes occurring within the course of a single infection of one multi cellular host are of obvious biological relevance for any disease 
Previous studies on viral recombination suffered from major drawbacks in this respect  basing their conclusions on experiments relying on complementation among non infectious viruses or between viruses with undetermined relative fitness  on phylogenetically based analyses  or on experiments in cell cultures 
For reasons detailed in the Introduction  the first two methods either do not provide information on the frequency of recombination  but only its occurrence  or address the question at a different temporal  and often spatial  scale 
Results from cell cultures  on the other hand  impose cell co infection by different viral variants  potentially overestimating the frequency of recombination events 
Our study circumvents these limitations by analyzing viral genotypes sampled from infected plants after the course of a single infection  and therefore the invasion and co infection of cells in various organs and tissues is very close to natural More than half of the genomes       see Table   present in a CaMV population after a single passage in its host plant were identified as recombinants  and these data allowed us to infer a per nucleotide per generation recombination rate on the order of       to      
The time length of one generation  i e  the time required for a given genome to go from one replication to the next  is totally unknown in plant viruses 
The only experimental data available on CaMV are based on the kinetics of gene expression in infected protoplasts  where the capsid protein is produced between   and   h   
The reverse transcription and the encapsidation of genomic DNA being two coupled phenomena    we judged it reasonable to assume a generation time of   d and  thus  an average of ten generations during our experiments 
In case this estimate is mistaken  we have verified a linear relationship between r and the number of generations  thereby allowing an immediate adjustment of r if the CaMV generation time is more precisely established 
At this point  we must consider that all cloned genomes may not have been through all the successive replication events potentially allowed by the timing of our experiments 
It was previously shown that about   of CaMV mature virus particles accumulate in compact inclusion bodies    where they may be sequestered for a long time  as such inclusions are very frequent in all infected cells  including those in leaves that have been invaded by the virus population for several weeks 
The viral population may thus present an age structure that could bias the estimation of the recombination rate 
In order to minimize this bias  the clones we analyzed were collected in one young newly formed leaf  where the chances of finding genomes from  unsequestered lines  were assumed to be higher 
In any case  our data analysis is conservative  since this age structure can only lead to an underestimation of the recombination rate Our results show that interferences between pairs of loci are negative  a recombination event between two loci apparently increases the probability of recombination between another pair of loci 
We believe that the most parsimonious explanation of these negative interferences is based on the way the infection builds up within plant hosts 
Indeed  one can divide infected host cells into those infected by a single virus genotype and those infected by more than one viral genotype 
In the former  analogous to clonal propagation  recombination is undetectable 
In the latter  recombination is not only detectable but  as our results indicate  very frequent 
Samples consisting of viruses resulting from a mixture of these two types of host cell infections will thus contain viruses with no recombination and viruses with several recombination events  thus yielding an impression of negative interference 
These conceptual arguments are supported by mathematical models 
It is indeed easy to show  detailed results not shown  that if a proportion F of the population reproduces clonally  analogous to single infections  while the remaining reproduces panmictically  negative interferences could be inferred even if they do not exist 
For example  assuming a three locus model with real recombination rates r
  and r
  and interference i
  the  apparent  recombination and interference parameters  would be r
        F r  r
        F r
  and i
     F   i
    F 
Interestingly  this example also shows that our estimates of the recombination rate are conservative  that a fraction F of host cells are singly infected while others are multiply infected leads to an underestimation of the recombination rate As judged by r
  r
  and r
  calculated between markers a–b  b–c  and c–d  respectively  we found evidence for recombination through the entire CaMV genome 
The values for r
 
r
  and r
  are remarkably similar  hence the recombination sites seem to be evenly distributed along the genome 
We considered the template switching model as the major way recombinants are created in CaMV 
As already mentioned in the Introduction  hot spots of template switching have been predicted at the position of the  ′ extremities of the  S and  S RNAs   
If other recombination mechanisms  such as that associated with second strand DNA synthesis or with the host cell DNA repair machinery  act significantly  hot spots would be expected at the positions of the sequence interruption     and     
Due to the design of our experiment and the position of the four markers  we have no information on putative hot spots at positions corresponding to the  ′ end of the  S RNA and to    at nucleotide position  
Nevertheless  the putative hot spots at the  ′ end of the  S RNA and at   and    nucleotide positions   and   respectively  fall between marker pairs c–d  b–c  and a–b  respectively 
Our results indicate that either these hot spots are quantitatively equivalent though predicted by different recombination mechanisms or  more likely  that they simply do not exist 
Whatever the explanation  what we observe is that the CaMV can exchange any portion of its genome  and thus any gene thereof  with an astonishingly high frequency during the course of a single host infection To our knowledge  the viral recombination rate has never previously been quantified experimentally for a plant virus   
In contrast  retroviruses and particularly HIV  have been extensively investigated in that sense 
As we have already discussed for these latter cases  the quantification of the intrinsic recombination rate was carried out in artificially co infected cell cultures 
The estimated intrinsic per nucleotide per generation recombination rate in HIV  is on the order of      less than one order of magnitude higher than our estimation for CaMV 
Because for various reasons detailed above we probably underestimate the within host CaMV recombination rate  we believe that the intrinsic recombination rate in CaMV is higher and perhaps on the order of that of HIV Other pararetroviruses such as plant badnaviruses or vertebrate hepadnaviruses have a similar cycle within their host cells  including steps of nuclear minichromosome  genomic size RNA synthesis  and reverse transcription and encapsidation 
Nevertheless  vertebrate hepadnaviruses  e g  hepatitis B virus  infect hosts that are very different from plants in their biology and physiology  and this could lead to a totally different frequency of cell co infection during the development of the virus populations 
Thus  even though our results can be informative for other pararetroviruses because of the viruses  shared biological characteristics  they should not be extrapolated to vertebrate pararetroviruses without caution We used the plasmid pCa  which is the complete genome of the CaMV isolate Cabb S  cloned into the pBR  plasmid at the unique SalI restriction site   
To analyze recombination in different regions of the genome  we introduced four genetic markers  a  b  c  and d  at the positions       and   respectively  thus approximately at four cardinal points of the CaMV circular double stranded DNA of   bp  Figure  
All markers  each corresponding to a single nucleotide change  were introduced by PCR directed mutagenesis in pCa  and resulted in the duplication of previously unique restriction sites BsiWI  PstI  MluI  and SacI in a plasmid designated pMark S  Because  in this study  we targeted the possible exchange of genes between viral genomes  all markers a  b  c  and d were introduced within coding regions corresponding to open reading frames I  IV  V  and VI  respectively 
Another important concern was to quantify recombination in the absence of selection  i e  to create neutral markers 
Consequently all markers consist of synonymous mutations  see below To generate the parental virus particles  plasmids pCa  and pMark S were mechanically inoculated into individual plants as previously described   
All plants were turnips  B  rapa cv   Just Right  grown under glasshouse conditions at   °C with a    light dark  photoperiod 
Thirty days post inoculation  all symptomatic leaves were harvested and viral particles were purified as described earlier   The resulting preparations of parental viruses  designated Cabb S and Mark S  were quantified by spectrometry using the formula described by Hull et al 
  
We fixed the initial frequency of markers to a value of   and a solution containing   mg ml of virus particles of both Cabb S and Mark S at a   ratio was prepared 
Plantlets were co infected by mechanical inoculation of two to three leaves with   μl of this virus solution  using abrasive Celite AFA  Fluka  Ronkonkoma  New York  United States 
The mixed CaMV population was allowed to grow during   d of systemic infection We designed an experimental protocol for quantifying marker frequency within a mixed Cabb S Mark S virus population after a single passage in a host plant 
Twenty four individual plants  inoculated as above with equal amounts of Cabb S and Mark S  were harvested   d post inoculation  when symptoms were fully developed 
The viral DNA was purified from   mg of young newly formed infected leaves according to the protocol described previously   
After the precipitation step of this protocol  the viral DNA was resuspended and further purified with the Wizard DNA clean up kit  Promega  Fitchburg  Wisconsin  United States  in TE  X   mM Tris HCl and   mM EDTA  pH   
Aliquots of viral DNA preparations were digested by restriction enzymes corresponding either to marker a  b  c  or d and submitted to a   agarose gel electrophoresis  colored by ethydium bromide and exposed to UV 
Each individual restriction enzyme cut once in Cabb S DNA and twice in Mark S  thus generating DNA fragments of different sizes attributable to one or the other in the mixed population of CaMV genomes 
After scanning the agarose gels  we estimated the relative frequency of the two genotypes in each viral DNA preparation and at each marker position  by densitometry using the NIH   Image program 
The statistical analyses of the frequency of the four markers are described below To identify and quantify the recombinants within the CaMV mixed populations  aliquots from ten of the   viral DNA preparations described above were digested by the restriction enzyme SalI  and directly cloned into pUC  at the corresponding site 
In each of the ten viral populations analyzed    full genome length clones were digested separately by BsiWI  PstI  MluI  and SacI  to test for the presence of marker a  b  c  and d  respectively 
In this experiment  with the marker representing an additional restriction site  we could easily distinguish between the Cabb S and the Mark S genotype at all four marker positions  upon agarose gel   electrophoresis of the digested clones 
Clones with none or all four markers were parental genotypes  whereas clones harboring     or   markers were clearly recombinants 
Due to the very high number of recombinants detected  markers eventually appearing or disappearing due to spontaneous mutations were neglected Here we present the different methods we used to quantify recombination in the CaMV genome 
Because all these methods assume that the different markers are neutral  we first discuss assumption We used two datasets to test the neutrality of markers  both resulting from plants co infected with a   ratio of Mark S and Cabb S 
The first consisted of viral DNA densitometry data derived from   plants  described above  where for each plant we have an estimate of the frequency of each marker in the genome population 
The second consisted of the restriction of   individual full genome length viral clones obtained from one co infected plant  described above  yielding an estimate of the frequency of each marker  and this was repeated on ten different plants 
The frequencies of the different markers were       and   for markers a  b  c  and d in the first dataset and       and   in the second dataset 
We tested whether these frequencies were significantly different from the expected value under neutrality    using either t tests  for datasets where normality could not be rejected  seven out of eight cases  or Wilcoxon signed rank non parametric tests otherwise  marker c in the first dataset 
In all cases p values were larger than  There are several cautionary remarks regarding these analyses 
First  in all cases we found an excess of markers 
Unfortunately  the two datasets cannot be regarded as independent because  even though the methods through which the frequency estimates were obtained were different  the plants used in the second dataset were a subset of the plants of the first 
We thus have only four independent estimates in each case  and there is minimal power to detect significant deviations from neutrality with such a small sample size 
It should be noted at this stage that deviations from the expected value could also be caused either by slight deviations from the   ratio in the infecting mixed solution  or by deviations from that ratio in the frequency of the viral particles that actually get into the plants 
Second  because of the relatively small sample sizes and low statistical power  the tests presented above could have detected only large deviations The results clearly show  however  precisely that the markers do not have large effects  if any  and that therefore recombination estimates would be affected only very slightly by any hypothetical selective effects of the markers 
Because of this  along with the fact that the introduced markers provoke silent substitutions in the CaMV genome  we assumed that markers were effectively neutral in the rest of the analysis The dataset used to estimate the recombination frequency consisted of the   full genome length viral clones   from each of ten co infected plants  individually genotyped for each of the four markers 
As discussed in detail in the Results  recombination was very frequent and concerned all four markers 
Indeed  approximately half of the genotyped clones exhibited a recombinant genotype 
It was therefore meaningful to try to obtain quantitative estimates of recombination from our data Our aim was to analyze viral recombination in a live host 
Consequently  we had to deal with the fact that more than one viral replication cycle occurred during the   d that infection lasted in our experiment  we had to wait that long for the disease to develop and to be able to recover sufficient amounts of viral DNA from each infection 
Based on the kinetics of gene expression    we postulate that each replication cycle lasts between   and   d  and that therefore seven to ten cycles occurred between infection and the sampling time 
In case this assumption is incorrect  we did calculations assuming five  seven  ten  or   replication cycles during these   d  As shown  the results were not affected qualitatively  and only slightly quantitatively 
It is important to note that we assumed that recombination occurred through a template switching mechanism  and that therefore  from a recombination point of view  the CaMV genome is linear 
The reverse transcription starts and finishes at the position   in Figure   which is the point of circularization of the DNA genome 
This implies that changes between contiguous markers a–b  b–c  and c–d can be considered as true recombination whereas those between a and d cannot  as they may simply stem from circularization of DNA  during the synthesis of which the polymerase has switched template once anywhere between a–b  b–c  or c–d To estimate the recombination rate between markers  we wrote recurrence equations describing the change in frequency of each genotype over one generation  assuming random mating and no selection  i e  the standard Wright–Fisher population genetics model 
We then expressed the frequency of all possible genotypes n generations later as a function of their initial frequency and of the recombination parameters 
Subsequently we calculated the maximum likelihood estimates of the recombination parameters and their asymptotic variances given initial frequencies  we assumed that the two  parental  genotypes  Mark S and Cabb S  had equal initial frequencies of   and that all other genotypes had initial frequencies of zero  and frequencies after n generations  the observed frequencies  as stated above we used different values of n 
All algebraic and numerical calculations were carried out with the software Mathematica The recombination parameters are the recombination rates between two adjacent loci  e g  r
  for the recombination rate between markers a and b  and the interference coefficients  e g  i
  for interference between recombination events in the segments between markers a and b and b and c  To define these parameters we followed Christiansen    and in particular the recombination distributions for two  three  and four loci  respectively  Tables     and   of   
It is important to realize that given the definitions of these parameters  the estimator of the recombination rate between two loci is not affected by the number of loci considered 
In other words  we obtain the same estimation of the recombination rate between markers a and b whether we consider genotypic frequencies at just these two loci  or the frequencies at these two loci plus a third locus  or the complete information to which we have access  the four marker genotypes 
Information on additional loci only affects the estimates of the interference coefficients It proved impossible to carry out the calculations for four loci algebraically 
Instead  we used a computer program to calculate the expected genotypic frequencies at all four loci after n generations  given the above stated initial frequencies and specified recombination parameters 
For each combination of recombination parameters we calculated a Euclidean distance between the vector of the expected genotypic frequencies and the observed genotypic frequencies  and considered that the estimated recombination parameters were those yielding the minimal Euclidean distance 
In all cases  the estimated recombination rates between pairs of loci were equal to the second decimal to those estimated algebraically from data for three or two loci Tumor Restrictions to Oncolytic VirusIn most solid tumors the tumor interior displays a high cellular density with multiple cell types  both malignant and normal  stromal  cells  interdigitated by strands of extracellular matrix  ECM  and other poorly defined tissue 
Stromal cells typically consist of fibroblasts  macrophages  neutrophils and other immune cell types 
Tumor associated fibroblasts are a source of the bulk acellular tissue in tumors    which is largely made up of polysugars and glycoproteins  such as collagens  laminins  fibronectins  proteoglycans  hyaluronan and water  forming a dense matrix around and between the cancer cells   
This matrix provides structural support but also haptotactic and chemotactic guidance for cancer cells   
Moreover  the prevailing tumor interstitium is rich in soluble angiogenic factors  such as members of the vascular endothelial growth factor  VEGF  family    cellular growth factors  including endothelial growth factor  EGF  basic fibroblast growth factor  FGF  platelet derived growth factor  PDGF  and pleiotrophic factors  particularly transforming growth factor  TGF  beta   
Additionally  both tumor  and stromal cells secrete cytokines and chemokines  such as interleukin  IL    IL   tumor necrosis factor  TNF  alpha  stromal cell derived factor  SDF    macrophage migration inhibitory factor  MIF    which on one hand recruit more stromal and progenitor cells into the tumors and on the other hand curb the activity of antigen presenting cells and anti tumor T cells   
In several independent cancer types  high serum levels of IL   and IL   are indicators of poor prognosis   Aberrant tumor and stromal growth combined with an overproduction of matrix leads to high interstitial pressure in the tumor  preventing lateral diffusion of therapeutic compounds within the tumor 
Tight cellular compactness combined with a high tumor proliferation rate also causes physical crowding and puts constraints on oxygenation  which due to aberrant angiogenesis and rupture of the haphazard vessels is mostly incomplete and results in chronic tissue hypoxia toward the tumor cores 
As cancer cells exist in a crowding hypoxic  and cytokine growth factor perpetuated chronic state of stress  they upregulate a number of key cellular molecules that function as a collective defense against a wide range of therapies  including oncolytic viruses 
The properties of oncolytic viruses and their status in clinical development as well as various delivery options have been reviewed elsewhere   
In this review  we provide an overview of two of the main intratumoral barriers to oncolytic virus spread  the extracellular tumor make up and the intracellular antiviral defense mechanisms Tumor cellular structure and composition may in concert with abundant extracellular matrix  ECM  deposition pose a severe hurdle for systemic virus entry and propagation of infection within the tumor 
The extracellular matrix is a complex dense network consisting of multiple proteins  glycoproteins and polysaccharides including collagens  laminins  fibronectins  proteoglycans and hyaluronic acid   
The interstitial fluid pressure  IFP  in the tumor surrounding blood and lymphatic vessels is mainly created by the high cell density that forms an increased physical pressure outwards and does not allow free diffusion of therapeutics   
A high IFP generally predicts an aggressive tumor phenotype as tumor cells tend to escape from tumor margins where the pressure drops  thus facilitating spread of metastatic cells   
On the other hand  for therapeutic virus  interstitial fluid concentration gradients may pose a hurdle as passive diffusion in viable regions  typically the rim  may occur mainly outward   
Given the limited arsenal of known chemicals alleviating tumor compactness and the poor penetration drugs in general into the tumor tissue  this is a considerable problem that may not be easy to tackle 
Some strategies are discussed below Viruses are passive particles and rely either on radial cell to cell spread or on soluble diffusion across concentration gradients to reach their target cells and to propagate the infection 
Tumor matrix is critical in this regard  as it can block both forms of spread 
Passively diffusing viruses may physically not fit through the strands of the ECM 
This was shown for oncolytic herpes virus  which has an outer diameter of over   nm  and whose spreading could be improved by matrix degrading bacterial collagenase co injection   
Bilbao and coworkers showed that adenovirus entry into experimental hepatocellular carcinoma nodules in the livers of immunocompetent rats following intravenous or intraportal injection was directly related to the thickness of the ECM capsule enveloping the nodules   
On the other hand  we found using Semliki Forest virus  which has an outer diameter of about   nm  that even upon intratumoral injection spread was blocked by ECM  which formed a physical barrier for virus infection  Figure  The foremost option to reduce interstitial fluid pressure and to remove physical molecule barriers imposed by the ECM is to use matrix degrading enzymes 
These act by digesting collagen  fibrin  and other types of fibrillar matrix deposits  creating more space between cell clusters  and glycosaminoglycan polymers  known to limit fluid movement in tumors 
Simultaneously  such strategies may also expose more cell surface to viruses  increasing the likelihood of infection 
In a study by Kuriyama  trypsin or collagenase dispase was injected into subcutaneous U  and U  glioma xenografts in immunocompromised mice  followed by a reporter adenovirus   
Both types of ECM degrading enzymes increased tumor transduction by the virus  but when doses got too high  transduction efficacy suffered  demonstrating a balance between ECM degradation and oncolytic virus efficacy 
In another study  treatment of PC  tumors with vaccinia virus producing matrix metalloprotease  MMP    resulted in reduction of collagen IV fibrils and increase in virus penetration into tumor  which yielded elevated virus titers   
Hong et al 
targeted orthotopic neuroblastoma xenografts engineered to express MMP  with oncolytic HSV  achieving increased virus distribution compared to control tumors   
Similar results were obtained when human soft tissue sarcoma HSTS T overexpressing MMP  or MMP  were injected with oncolytic HSV   
MMP expressing tumors contained significantly less sulfated glycosaminoglycans compared to control tumors 
Other enzymes and protein effectors  either engineered into virus expression cassettes or provided exogenously  include hyaluronidase  decorin  various other MMPs  and notably relaxin a peptide hormone normally expressed during particular phase of pregnancy that does not possess tissue degrading activity itself  but instead induces a number of key collagen degrading proteases seemingly in a tumor specific manner   
Beyer showed that relaxin expressed by murine stem cells improved trastuzumab penetrance and therapy outcome in syngeneic tumor models   
In another study  chimeric adenovirus Ad  expressing relaxin showed increased tumor transduction and virus dissemination   Several other strategies to increase penetration of therapeutics in tumors have been developed   
While the stromal ECM capsule of tumor nodules acts as a physical barrier to virus entry following intravenous injection  it was possible to improve tumor infection by administering vaso active compounds  angiotensin II  histamine  nitroglycerine  before the virus   
This is interesting  as vasculature per se would not be expected to alter or influence the physical composition of the ECM  such as collagen strand thickness 
Instead  virus access to the tumor was improved  most likely by increased access from the blood via tumor stromal adjoining vessels 
Interestingly  in a study with oncolytic herpes virus  anti VEGF monoclonal antibody Bevacizumab given before intravenous virus injection gave poorer anti tumor efficacy than when given after the virus   
The study showed that while HSV is able to enter and infect tumors better through their leaky vasculature compared to Bevacizumab normalized vasculature  vascular normalization by Bevacizumab still gave superior combination efficacy when the virus was already in the tumor 
This effect was likely dependent on altering both physical and biological properties of the tumor  including interstitial pressure and oxygenation 
In another study  anti VEGF A antibody injections in nude mice harboring U  human glioma xenografts led to an increase in MMP  expression and reduction in collagen fiber content  facilitating improved distribution of oncolytic adenovirus within the tumor tissue   
In general  targeting tumor vasculature by oncolytic viruses and including agents that affect tumor vasculature in combination regimens is gaining interest    and it will be interesting to see more specific studies on how vascular acting agents may affect the physical barriers to oncolytic viruses Some viruses do not need an extracellular step for propagating infection  such as members of the herpes and poxvirus families  and may be able to spread from cell to cell 
For example  HSV  is able to infect neighboring cells via lateral tight junctions in a manner dependent on its glycoproteins E and I   
Vaccinia virus  on the other hand  induces so called actin tails  which are actin filament driven membranous protrusions of the plasma membrane harboring a single virus particle at the outer tip 
These actin tails actively deliver and deposit virus particles onto or even into neighboring cells   
Because lateral spread without an extracellular step may circumvent neutralizing immunity as well as some of the physical obstacles the tumor microenvironment imposes  this ability has been engineered into viruses that normally do not possess it 
A promising strategy is to engineer OVs to express membrane fusogenic genes  MFGs  such as gibbon ape leukemia virus  GALV  glycoprotein  reptilian reovirus p  protein  FAST  or the membrane glycoproteins H and F of measles virus   
Quite intriguingly  expression of several different MFGs by oncolytic adenovirus synergized with chemotherapy in anti tumor efficacy both in vitro and in vivo    suggesting that membrane fusion facilitated lateral spread of also chemotherapeutics  which otherwise would not have occurred in a compact tumor 
The potential limitation of cell to cell dependent spread  however  may be that membrane free physical barriers  such as the ECM  may still pose a barrier to spread 
Also  it is unclear whether MFGs or other mechanisms of lateral spread may assist in reaching distant tumor nests Some other strategies to alleviate matrix imposed restrictions to oncolytic viruses have been discussed elsewhere   Tumors of epithelial origin mostly retain the firm cellular integrity seen in their original adhesive intercellular configuration 
Several viruses use cellular receptors which are located in paracellular tight junctions  which may be problematic in tightly packed tumors   
Adenovirus C group viruses use coxsackie adenovirus receptor  CAR  as their primary entry point  whereas adenovirus B  group members and measles virus Edmonston use CD  complement binding molecule as their cellular receptor   
Adenovirus B  group  serotypes       and   entry occurs using desmoglein   DSG    
Of these  CAR and DSG  are preferentially located within tight junctions and are hidden from virus binding   
Also the complement receptor CD  was ascribed a role in maintenance of epithelial cell integrity by interactions with the E cadherin catenin network   
These observations imply that before reaching the potential entry site on the tumor cell the virus must find its way into the junctional space 
Moreover  it has become increasingly clear that for example glioma tumors traditionally targeted by Ad  serotype adenoviruses often express only low levels of CAR and instead much higher levels of CD    Beyond that tight junctions hide multiple virus receptors  they contain a network of adhesion molecules  including ZO  cadherins  claudins and occludin  which  if perturbed  is associated with more aggressive disease in many types of cancer   
Since tight junctions also contain important receptors that mediate tumor promoting signaling and which have been targeted by monoclonal antibodies  notably Her  it would be highly useful to develop strategies that temporarily loosen the tight junction contacts even at cost of a transient increase in tumor metastatic risk 
One of the most interesting approaches has been to exploit the natural propensity of adenovirus serotype   which as part of its natural life cycle creates dodecahedral particles  PtDd  consisting of viral capsid proteins  penton base and fiber that open tight junctions by binding to and dissolving desmoglein  dimers and reducing E cadherin expression  to develop a specific tight junction opening molecule  JO    
Adenovirus type   uses PtDds to promote its own infection  opening the tight junctions ahead of infection to maximize access to desmoglein 
Analogously  when administered to human tumor xenografts  JO  facilitated penetration of trastuzumab much deeper into the tumor tissue than when the monoclonal antibody was administered on its own   
Moreover  JO  synergized with several chemotherapeutics in solid tumor models   
Backed by our own findings with oncolytic SFV  showing that both extracellular matrix and tumor cell compactness restrict virus spread and oncolytic efficacy  we believe combination approaches that target both tight junctions and extracellular matrix will prove effective in future virotherapy development  Figure  An alternative approach to increasing tumor penetration by oncolytic viruses is to alter tumor cell morphology and status 
Notably  cell death and in particular the type of cell death induced by virus has been shown to affect virus distribution within a tumor mass  in a study by Nagano et al  administration of apoptosis inducing paclitaxel before injecting oncolytic herpes simplex virus increased virus dissemination in the tumor  allowing its diffuse in  tunnels  created by shrinking dying tumor cells   Maintenance of physiological adherence is essential for proper ECM function and for retaining cellular integrity 
Therefore  a potential caveat of using ECM degrading proteolytic enzymes or tight junction openers is the risk of neoplastic cell detachment from the tumor ECM and increased risk of metastasis 
While ECM degradation or tight junction opening may operate innocuously  there is also a chance that loss of E cadherins via proteases or via non specific deregulation of tight junction integrity during ECM modulating therapy could trigger pro tumorigenic Wnt β catenin signaling  possibly driving epithelial to mesenchymal transition   
One study showed that ectopic relaxin expression stimulated MMP expression and enhanced breast cancer invasiveness    whereas another paper found short term relaxin exposure to increase breast cancer cell motility whereas long term expression reduced both motility and cancer invasiveness   
In the context of oncolytic viruses  Lavilla Alonso tested several proteases  including hyaluronidase  relaxin  and macrophage metalloelastase  and showed they all could assist adenovirus entry into tumors  yet  the authors did not detect treatment induced metastases or increase in tumor invasiveness   
Another strategy possibly balancing some of the putative risks of tight junction disruption could be to use Wnt dependent oncolytic viruses   Tumors are invariably fenestrated by host fibroblasts  myeloid cells and other non transformed cells  which driven by cancer induced cues can adopt various reprogrammed phenotypes to promote tumor angiogenesis and growth and to alter tumor responses to therapies   
As most of them normally play a role in immune homeostasis and pathogen sensing  they also respond to and influence oncolytic virus infection of tumors Fulci et al 
reported that injection of oncolytic HSV  directly into glioblastoma tumor parenchyma triggered upregulation of CD  and CD  monocytic markers and rapid clearance of virus  likely executed by infiltrating phagocytic cells   
When clodronate liposomes were used to deplete macrophages in vivo  the authors observed a  fold increase in virus titers in the brain tumors concomitant with an   reduction in peripheral CD  macrophages in animal spleens  suggesting that CD  cells migrate into the tumors upon virus injection and limit overall oncolytic efficacy 
While CD  cells were not reduced by peripheral macrophage depletion  arguing that these cells had been recruited to the tumors before the treatment  they could be eliminated in live glioma slices ex vivo  resulting in a  fold increase in virus replication 
Macrophages may secrete antiviral type I interferon constitutively at very low  subnanomolar  levels   and recently Liu et al 
showed that tumor resident CD  macrophages induced a protective antiviral state in ovarian and breast tumors which led to resistance to oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus  VSV  infection   
Type I IFN signaling  JAK  inhibitor Ruxolitinib reversed the resistance  facilitating VSV replication in the macrophage protected cancer cells 
It is tempting to speculate that tumor resident macrophages also rendered syngeneic GL  and DBT mouse gliomas completely refractory to VA  oncolytic alphavirus  as these cells were quite infectable in vitro and live glioma slices regained their sensitivity to virus within   h  indicating dilution of IFN I   Macrophages or the closely related myeloid suppressor cells are the predominant stromal cell type in many tumors and are actively recruited during cancer progression   
Heavy macrophage presence in the tumors indicates that such tumors may be resistant to oncolytic virotherapy  unless depleting preconditioning would be used 
Moreover  as part of the early immune response to virus infection  monocytic cells are rapidly recruited to tumors following intratumoral virus injection 
In one study  depletion of either CD b  cells or VEGF secreted by these cells in mice treated with oncolytic HSV  greatly increased oncolytic efficacy  tentatively linking pro tumorigenic and antiviral angiogenic mechanisms   Another key pro tumorigenic signaling employed by many tumors is up regulation of CXCR  the receptor for chemokine CXCL   also known as SDF  and recruitment of stromal cells expressing CXCL  which maintain the tumor and recruit additional cells to support tumor expansion and invasion  such as endothelial cell progenitors which contribute to neovascularization   
Indeed  high CXCR  expression is a negative prognostic factor for many cancers 
Oncolytic vaccinia virus engineered to express a soluble antagonist of CXCR  showed improved intratumoral virus replication  increased vascular disruption and a markedly reduced infiltration of the tumors by putative immune suppressive and tumor promoting stromal cells   
This study highlights how reducing pro tumor stromal cell effects may alleviate antiviral resistance and yield increased overall therapeutic efficacy 
On the other hand  if the paracrine antiviral effects of tumor homing monocytic cells could be selectively abrogated these cells could favorably be used to ferry oncolytic viruses into tumors 
Indeed  a significant delay in metastatic tumor potential was achieved when macrophages were harnessed to deliver a tumor specific oncolytic adenovirus   What is the antiviral status in human cancer 
Recent analyses from different normal cells that occupy the same organ reveal striking functional variation in components of the type I IFN signaling pathway that correlate with the tissue tropism and virulence of some virus strains   
Can similar variation in such components be found in cancer cells  or do cancer cells make an exception Transformed cells undergo selective elimination by the immune system before becoming cancerous  termed immunoediting  based on observations of differential capacity of immunocompetent mice to reject tumors previously grown in immunocompromised hosts versus syngeneic animals   
Cancer cell responsiveness to type I and type II IFNs plays a role during immunoediting  cancer cells that eventually progress to form a tumor display reduced capacity to respond to IFN gamma  which otherwise would upregulate MHC class I molecules and render the tumors amenable to CD  T cell mediated destruction  whereas responsiveness to type I interferon initially helps tumors avoid immune purging during the editing phase and is then irrelevant   
Of note  the anti tumor effects of type I IFN  still exploited today in several cancers  were shown to depend on host NK cells  and mice in which IFNAR was blocked by monoclonal antibody failed to reject even highly immunogenic tumors  as opposed to mice treated with control antibody  who all rejected the immunogenic tumor challenge   
Thus  whereas tumor responsiveness to type I IFN is not predetermined after immunoediting  other factors post immunoediting may influence it In several tumor types  varying levels of expression of components of the type I IFN signaling cascade have been detected  and in some tumor types these components have been found to have prognostic value  whereas in others they do not seem to influence survival   
However  emerging data suggests that antiviral genes may predict poor survival because they increase treatment resistance 
In one study  poor prognosis of several types of cancer due to genotoxic treatment resistance was found to correlate with increased activity of IFN I pathway genes   
In this study  a triad of type I IFN signaling pathway genes  STAT  ISG  and IFIT  formed a pan tumor type negative prognostic factor  and a broader seven gene cluster established negative prognostic criteria for treatment resistant breast cancer 
Treatment resistance was subsequently shown to depend on STAT  signaling  STAT expressing tumor clones were positively selected in animals in vivo  demonstrating increased proliferation and metastatic potential  and STAT expression mediated resistance against genotoxic assault by doxorubicin or ionizing radiation  knockdown of STAT  resulted in lower proliferation rate and metastatic capacity and increased sensitivity to genotoxic stress    
In another study  resistance to epigenetic DNA modifiers  AZA dC  a methyltransferase inhibitor  and LBH  or MGCD  both histone deacetylase  HDAC  inhibitors  was correlated with increased expression of IFN I pathway genes in small lung cancer cells   
Basal IFN related gene expression in several different SML cell lines was upregulated Interestingly  in many cancers  STAT proteins are not phosphorylated and persist in unphosphorylated form  U STAT 
Like its phosphorylated counterpart  U STAT  increases expression of genes contributing to resistance to DNA damaging agents   
While it is currently unknown why cancers may prefer to use unphosphorylated forms  it is known that U STATs activate distinct signals compared to their phosphorylated counterparts 
However  importantly for oncolytic viruses  in many tumors  constant expression and release of type I IFN leads to a constitutively high level of unphosphorylated forms of STAT  STAT  and IRF  which together form an unphosphorylated but functional ISGF like complex that relocalizes to the nucleus and drives expression of a specific set of ISGs distinct from acute IFN I exposure   
These ISGs are sufficient to maintain a functional antiviral defense and they play a critical role in resistance to DNA damaging agents On a cellular level  virus replication is controlled by antiviral defense molecules    which in turn are primarily controlled by type I IFN signaling 
In addition to classical type I IFN  or cytokine induced antiviral signaling  tumors may employ other antiviral defense mechanisms 
For example  stromal cells may secrete peptides with antiviral properties called defensins   
The defensins are amphiphatic and typically  –  amino acids in length and interfere with viruses by physically binding to and disrupting virus particles and or by inducing antiviral responses in target cells via pattern recognition receptors 
At least oral squamous cell carcinomas were found to overexpress defensins compared to normal control tissues   
While the role of defensins in oncolytic virus infection of tumors is unclear  one study showed that the immune stimulating properties of defensins may be exploited to increase overall therapeutic efficacy 
In this study  expression of beta   defensin from a conditionally replicating adenovirus yielded a superior therapeutic entity compared to the unarmed parental virus via enhanced anti tumor immune responses mediated by TLR dependent activation of dendritic cells   In summary  human cancers display varying degrees of expression of antiviral proteins or their signaling regulators at baseline 
Some of these may increase in response to genotoxic anti cancer treatments 
In the next chapter we will highlight some of the consequences to oncolytic virotherapy of the heterogeneity in type I IFN responsiveness in tumor cells All oncolytic viruses tested to date display variable infectivity in different cancer cell lines 
This variability is likely at least partly dependent on type I IFN as most oncolytic viruses are IFN sensitive 
IFN secretion follows virus sensing by the cells via Toll like receptors expressed on both the plasma membrane and in endocytotic vesicles  NOD like receptors  STING  AIM  NLP inflammosome and other danger sensing molecules  summarized elsewhere   
While all viruses carry an arsenal of counteracting molecules    no virus goes completely undetected 
Even HSV amplicons  which are devoid of functional virus genes  induce a type I IFN response that mediates a STAT dependent system wide antiviral defense in mice within one hour of intravenous vector injection  resulting in significant reduction of transgene expression compared to expression in STAT  knockout animals   During our own studies with attenuated SFV vector VA  it became apparent that the dramatic and lasting therapeutic efficacy achieved following mere single intravenous  or intratumoral  injection of the virus in immunocompromised mice bearing human A  melanoma or U  glioma xenografts   was not going to be recapitulated easily in immunocompetent animals   
The paradox in our studies was that while oncolytic SFV vector VA  effectively replicated in and destroyed a variety of IFN responsive cancer cell lines in vitro  it consistently failed to eradicate tumors generated from the same cell types in vivo  even if large doses of virus were injected directly into the tumor mass and even if the tumors were void of visible physical barriers  Figure  
Conversely  only tumors generated from IFN unresponsive cancer cells have seemed infectable in vivo by VA  so far 
In light of earlier findings by others  showing that type I IFN receptor knockout mice are highly susceptible to SFV infection and quickly succumb to multi organ systemic infection    the parameters for oncolytic SFV efficacy seem clear  tumor cells must be defective in type I IFN response for the virus to be effective These findings are in line with emerging data from other groups  showing a remarkably strict dependence of oncolytic virus replication on defective type I IFN responsiveness  a dogma introduced at the turn of the  st century   
For example  sarcomas and melanomas display differing permissiveness to oncolytic VSV  an obstacle which may be overcome by blocking type I IFN signaling   
In eight sarcoma cell lines  basal up regulation of RIG I and IFIT  and rapid induction of STAT  phosphorylation upon IFN I treatment correlated with resistance to oncolytic measles virus   
In other studies  human pancreatic and ovarian cancer cells display resistance against Rb dependent oncolytic adenovirus  strongly correlating with intracellular levels of MxA  and acquired resistance to repeated oncolytic adenovirus injections in an intraperitoneal ovarian carcinoma model was associated with an increase in MxA as well as several other key ISGs in the tumors   
A study comparing normal human or mouse melanocytes to a panel of melanoma cells revealed strong correlation between permissiveness to oncolytic VSV and capacity to mount antiviral defense in response to type I IFN   
In this study  VSV rp  harboring two mutations in P and L genes  was superior to several other tested oncolytic VSV strains  but the dependence on defective IFN responsiveness was still retained 
In yet another study  oncolytic VSV replicated in four out of twelve mesothelioma cell lines which were unable to mount antiviral defense upon IFN beta pretreatment or to respond to infection by up regulation of PKR  MxA or  OAS mRNA   
In contrast  the non permissive mesothelioma cells mounted antiviral defense  associated with PKR  MxA or  OAS mRNA up regulation  in response to infection or to exogenous type I IFN 
The authors of this study further linked the observed pattern of virus resistance to clinical mesothelioma samples  where in a mesothelioma tissue array  significant variance in immunoreactivity against PKR  p  and or IFNAR was observed  with only a few samples displaying lack of reactivity against all three components  arguing that most tumors in clinical settings would display at least some level of resistance to oncolytic VSV Oncolytic adenoviruses are often deleted for E A  which normally binds Rb and prevents it from sequestering E F  which results in the viruses being unable to replicate in normal cells 
However  since adenovirus  as with all viruses  contains elements that antagonize antiviral defenses  such elements have also been targets for deletion to render the virus sensitive to innate antiviral defenses  which would be expected to remain intact only in normal cells 
Cancer cells expressing Ras may down regulate protein kinase R and inhibit type I IFN induction by interfering with RIG I signaling   
Also  select interferon stimulated genes appear to be repressed by the Ras MEK ERK signaling cascade   
PKR activation shuts down E F dependent translation  including translation of virus messenger RNAs 
Therefore  an adenovirus deleted for VA RNA  which antagonizes PKR  should be capable of replicating in Ras overexpressing  tumor  cells 
However  while this was seemingly the case    it was later discovered that Ras is not an obligatory determinant for PKR inactivation and that virus replication was halted even in Ras overexpressing cells via functional PKR mediated E F phosphorylation  implying that the parameters of VA RNA deleted adenovirus replication had to be revised   
Similar findings were obtained with oncolytic reovirus  against which Ras independent tumor resistance emerged in vivo   
Thus  under some circumstances even tumor cells over expressing Ras may respond to type I IFN or to stimulants of pattern recognition receptors  activating PKR and inhibiting virus translation 
To complicate matters  MEK inhibitors have been shown restore antiviral signaling capacity in Ras overexpressing tumors   
This implies that human tumors treated with MEK inhibitors  such as Trametinib which was recently approved for treatment of BRAF mutated melanoma  may be poor targets for oncolytic viruses as antiviral signaling capacity in such tumors may be restored Some oncolytic viruses  such as members of the poxvirus family  are seemingly resistant to the antiviral effects of type I IFNs in vitro and may be controlled by other cellular factors   
However  in most cases  sensitivity or resistance to type I IFN is assessed in vitro and using only one cytokine  which may mask synergies with other factors present in vivo 
One possible explanation for the in vitro–in vivo discrepancy is the tumor micro environment  which not only imposes physical barriers to oncolytic viruses but also alters intracellular antiviral defenses 
For example  glioma cells were found in the brain to spontaneously secrete type I IFN  which conferred resistance against oncolytic HSV 
Resistance was linked to ECM protein CCN  interaction with glioma cell surface receptor alpha   beta   integrin  which activated interferon secretion   
It is tempting to speculate whether this or a similar ECM glioma interaction could have contributed to the resistance of syngeneic glioma cells we observed in vivo but not in vitro to both oncolytic SFV and vaccinia virus  FIG    
Also  while critical in many respects  antiviral signaling may occur without signaling via type I IFN receptor  IFNAR 
For instance  upon infection of IFNAR KO mice with murine hepatitis virus  MHV  brain cells were found to have upregulated antiviral GTPase TGTP and IFITm  and IFITm  all of which have confirmed antiviral activity in vivo against a variety of viruses   
In these cases  IFN gamma and TNF alpha likely account for at least part of the observed ISG activity  where e g  TGTP is upregulated by IFN γ signaling and TNFα has been shown to induce ISG  independently of IFNAR   Interestingly  while most cancers are heterogeneous in antiviral defence signaling  one broad class of tumors in particular may display consistently low capacity to ward off oncolytic viruses  oncovirus induced cancers 
This is because oncoviruses  as all viruses  carry a complement of factors that abrogate antiviral sensors and effectors  which may result in tumors that are uniformly devoid of antiviral signaling 
In an intriguing study  oncolytic VSV infected and destroyed human papilloma virus  HPV positive cervical carcinoma cells more effectively than HPV negative head  and neck cancer cells due to HPV E mediated suppression of antiviral signaling   
HPV positive or E expressing xenografts were efficiently eradicated from nude mice following VSV injection 
The potential of this approach is that even oncolytic viruses that are extremely sensitive to type I IFN  such as attenuated SFV or M mutated VSV  may function well against oncovirus induced cancers where the oncovirus machinery ensures the lack of antiviral defense While on first thought it would appear counterintuitive to antagonize the very factors that keep oncolytic viruses tumor specific  emerging data shows that this can be accomplished in a safe way 
One of the foremost strategies to increase oncolytic virus efficacy is to combine them with drugs that lower tumor antiviral defenses 
In this regard  a primary target for interference is the prototypical type I IFN signaling cascade 
While small molecular inhibitors against IFNAR are not available  activity of downstream signaling transducers may effectively be blocked 
Human pancreatic cancer cells were shown to constitutively express high levels of MxA and OAS and to mount type I IFN dependent resistance to oncolytic VSV 
Resistance could be overcome by blocking activity of IFNAR associated Janus kinase  JAK      
Similarly  JAK  inhibitor ruxolitinib overcame type I IFN dependent resistance of human SCC  head and neck cancer cells against oncolytic VSV   
Ruxolitinib also successfully abrogated type I IFN mediated antiviral effects elicited by macrophages    highlighting that this drug might also alleviate type I IFN dependent tumor resistance to oncolytic viruses imposed by stromal cells 
However  the obvious downside to using JAK inhibitors is their effects on critical host defense mechanisms  which may result in increased infection of normal cells 
Moreover  JAK inhibitors may reduce anti tumor immune responses elicited by oncolytic virotherapy 
For example  ruxolitinib was shown to impair the capacity of dendritic cells promote CD  T cell responses against model tumor antigens   
On the other hand  in this study clearance of adenovirus was delayed in ruxolitinib treated normal animals  which makes it difficult to predict the overall impact of JAK inhibitors on tumor therapy where prolonged virus presence might translate to better therapeutic efficacy 
Also  while the immune stimulating and anti tumor effects of type I and type II interferons may be adversely affected by JAK inhibitors  central tumor promoting cascades mediated by JAKs  such as IL STAT  may also be inhibited    yielding a difficult to predict net therapeutic outcome 
At the moment  more studies are needed to establish the overall impact of interference with JAK  signaling in cancer therapy Spurred by earlier reports of oncovirus reactivation and promoter enhancement by histone deacetylase  HDAC  inhibitors  this class of agents was assessed for capacity to enhance oncolytic virus potency by inhibiting antiviral responses 
Indeed  such enhancement was observed with oncolytic VSV and SFV  and while it has been difficult to pinpoint the exact mechanisms that underlie HDAC inhibitor enhancement of oncolytic virus replication in cancer cells  antiviral defenses in general are inhibited for yet unknown reasons mainly in cancer cells and not in normal cells  which indirectly facilitates virus replication   
Interestingly  combination of HDAC inhibitors with conditionally replicating   E A deleted adenovirus gave improved virus replication rate and therapeutic efficacy in subcutaneous xenograft models only when the inhibitors were given before the virus  otherwise inhibition of replication was observed   
Similarly  HDAC inhibitors increased replication and oncolytic efficacy of HSV when given before the virus but not when given at the same time   
With nuclear DNA viruses  such as adenovirus and HSV  it is possible that HDAC inhibitors also alter virus genome accessibility to transcription factors  resulting in reduced replication or other adverse effects  implying that with these viruses HDAC inhibitors should be administered before the viruses Recently  it was found that HDAC inhibitor vorinostat activates NfκB signaling by facilitating hyperacetylation of the p  subunit  which in turn activates cellular autophagy   
Autophagy was in another study shown to be important for VSV replication  presumably by inhibiting antiviral signaling 
This is interesting  as a previous study revealed enhancement of VSV replication by inhibiting TNF alpha induced antiviral signaling mediated by p  using NfκB inhibitors BMS  or TPCA    
In this study  neither inhibitor had an effect on STAT  or STAT  phosphorylation or their nuclear relocalization in response to type I IFN but the authors observed clear induction of ISG  GBP  and MX  in response to type I IFN in U  glioma cells  with the latter two being dependent on NfκB signaling 
Taken together  NfκB pathway activation may result in different antiviral responses in different cancer types  and inhibition or enhancement of oncolytic viruses by NfκB inhibitors is dependent on other concomitant cellular mechanisms  such as autophagy Since HDAC inhibitors modulate promoter activity accessibility  it is conceivable other epigenetic or promoter modifying agents could work in a similar manner to repress antiviral defense induction and enhance oncolytic viruses   
DNA demethylating agents  azacytidine  Aza  and decitabine synergized with oncolytic herpes simplex type   virus in glioma models in vitro and in vivo  as did HDAC inhibitor valproic acid  VPA  which was already shown before to work well with oncolytic HSV as well as several other oncolytic viruses   
Moreover  inhibition of cancer antiviral defenses  specifically RNAseL and PKR  resulted when cancer cells were exposed to sunitinib  a multi tyrosine kinase inhibitor originally developed as an inhibitor of VEGF R and PDGF R signaling  yielding strong anti tumor synergy with IFN sensitive oncolytic VSV   
Since sunitinib is approved for renal cell carcinoma and imatinib resistant gastric cancers  combination with oncolytic VSV constitutes a promising and clinically relevant approach warranting further investigation 
Interstingly  sunitinib as well as several other receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors displayed antiviral effects against polyomavirus BK    arguing that these compounds are not universal virus enhancers Cyclophosphamide  CPA  is a general immunosuppressant used to minimize Treg presence during immunotherapy and also oncolytic virotherapy 
CPA may  however  also enhance replication and efficacy of oncolytic viruses by diminishing cytokine secretion by stromal cells  including type I IFN   
Another compound enhancing oncolytic virus efficacy by lowering cell responsiveness to type I IFN is triptolide  which acts downstream of IRF  activation   
Further  the kinase mammalian target of rapamycin  mTOR  enhances the antiviral effects of type I IFN by activation of its effector proteins  E BP  which binds and inactivates translation factor eIF E  and S K  which carries out cell type specific signaling functions of type I IFN  such as activation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor  B and promotion of ISG  transcription 
Consequently  rapamycin was able to enhance oncolytic VSV replication and anti tumor efficacy by inhibiting type I IFN mediated antiviral signaling via mTOR   Several other compounds synergizing with oncolytic viruses have been identified via high throughput drug library screening  many of which seem to act by antagonizing antiviral defenses 
For instance  a novel virus sensitizer  Vse  was found to greatly diminish antiviral effects of type I IFN against oncolytic VSV in several cancer cell types  and the drug also synergized with the virus in subcutaneous mouse tumor models   
For many of these new compounds  the mechanism of action is still poorly understood  necessitating extensive safety studies to exclude undesirable effects against normal cells Apart from classical type I IFN induced antiviral defenses  which typically prevent virus translation and degrade virus genomes  other cellular machineries regulate oncolytic virus efficacy 
Notably  strategies to increase cancer cell death in response to oncolytic viruses have been tested 
In a recent study  a class of compounds called SMAC mimetics synergized in several cancer models with oncolytic VSV by removing cancer cell block to apoptosis in response to virus induced type I IFN  TNF α or TRAIL   
Interestingly  since virus infection triggered cytokines act on nearby non infected cells  SMAC mimetics may in combination with oncolytic viruses also cause significant bystander tumor destruction 
Normal cells are not affected by the IFN SMAC mimetic synergy  providing an important safety aspect 
In another study  blocking the ER stress response circuitry triggered by oncolytic rhabdovirus infection by a small molecular inhibitor of serine threonine protein kinase and endoribonuclease IRE α  which was identified in a genome wide siRNA screen  greatly enhanced cytotoxicity via caspase induced apoptosis and increased oncolytic efficacy in refractory tumor models in mice   
This effect was independent on induction or responsiveness to type I IFN 
Conversely  inhibitors of nucleoside transporter   ENT  were discovered from a high throughput screen of enhancers of oncolytic HSV  and to date such inhibitors have not been reported to alter cellular antiviral responses   
Other compounds  such as common chemotherapeutics  and their mechanisms synergizing with oncolytic viruses have been discussed elsewhere for most of them the possible role of antiviral defense antagonism in enhancing oncolytic virus efficacy remains to be studied   Thus  many compounds are available to interfere with tumor antiviral defenses 
The outstanding question for most of them  however  seems to be why such compounds do not render normal cells sensitive to oncolytic viruses 
Elucidation of the exact mechanisms of action and the differences between normal and cancer cells constitute a worthy goal for studies in the near future Already in the  s it became clear that using certain pathogenic wildtype viruses  such as West Nile virus and Bunyamwera virus  in cancer patients would result in off target toxicity   
Characteristic for pathogenic viruses is a greater ability to circumvent or antagonize cellular innate antiviral defenses than attenuated strains 
For example  unlike the prototypical oncolytic reovirus strain type   Dearing  the T L strain of reovirus causes accumulation of IRF  in the nucleus and inhibits activation of a select group of ISGs yet because of this property the T L strain is myocarditic unlike the oncolytic type   Dearing strain   
For these reasons  many oncolytic viruses used today  such as reovirus type   Dearing  oncolytic strains of Newcastle disease virus and M mutated VSV have either a stronger capacity to induce or a weaker capacity to resist antiviral type I IFN than the corresponding wildtype strains   An open question  however  is whether strain specific or virus specific differences that relate to specific components of the cellular antiviral machinery may be exploited for greater anti tumor efficacy  i e  if one virus fails  could another be used in its stead 
While Ras expression was critical for oncolytic reovirus replication in cells overexpressing CUG  oncogene  oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus was unable to replicate in the same cells due to increased activation of STAT  and OASL    
Thus  in these cells reovirus was not affected by STAT  or OASL  and it therefore remains interesting to see which other antiviral effectors may have been lacking in the CUG expressing cells and  conversely  how reovirus and VSV differ in terms of sensitivity to antiviral effectors 
While several oncolytic viruses have been compared to each other in terms of replication rate and cytotoxicity  systematic studies with regard to tumor antiviral defenses have not been conducted As any attenuated virus is likely to replicate effectively only in its own niche  i e  to be restricted by a specific set of ISGs  and as wild type strains may be too toxic for use in humans  a compromise may be achieved by incorporating select elements from wild type viruses into oncolytic virus backbones 
Indeed  several chimeric and recombinant viruses have been generated that harbor specific elements of wild type strains or even of other unrelated viruses in order to better resist cancer antiviral defenses  Table  
As an example of introducing wild type elements into attenuated viruses  Haralambieva reported on a measles virus Edmonston vaccine strain in which P gene was replaced with the counterpart from the wild type IC B strain   
Later  Meng et al 
included N  P  and L genes from wild type measles in Edmonston backbone  producing an enhanced but still safe oncolytic virus   
Edmonston vaccine virus induces a more robust IFN response compared to wild type measles virus partly due to the weaker ability of V protein to suppress MDA mediated activation of IRF  and IFN I induction   
In vivo  P gene encoded proteins  particularly V  control the quality of the cytokine response to measles so that vaccine strains qualitatively induce a stronger inflammatory response compared to WT strains  where WT V protein suppresses multiple cytokine secretion 
V protein short cytoplasmic tail has been shown to bind and inactivate STAT  IRF  MDA  and the Rel homology domain of the NfκB subunit p  but not of p    
Also  V causes LGP  protein to bind and inactivate RIG I    but it seemingly does not interfere with TICAM   TRIF  multiple TLR adaptor  including TLR mediated IFN β induction 
Thus  if cancer and normal cells would differ with regard to TICAM  or IRF  then such a virus could potentially target specifically cancer cells rather than normal cells 
So far  the measles Edmonston WT chimeras have proven safe in animals As an example of heterologous virus constructs  lentogenic Newcastle disease virus engineered to express influenza virus PR   H N  NS  showed enhanced oncolytic efficacy in vivo due to dampening of antiviral responses   
While such a virus did not display enhanced pathogenicity in that study  a mesogenic NDV virus harboring NS  from influenza strain H N  did show increased pathogenicity in chickens as well as an increased ability to replicate in human cells    raising some cautionary warnings for future engineering of similar replicative viruses 
As another example  vaccinia virus soluble type I IFN scavenger B R  NOTE  B R is often used in the literature  has been engineered into both oncolytic HSV and oncolytic rhabdoviruses  resulting in all cases in more effective therapy agents without loss of tumor specificity   
Oncolytic γ  gene deleted HSV was complemented by two different PKR antagonists from human cytomegalovirus  TRS  and IRS  generating a chimera capable of reaching wild type virus replication levels in cancer cells in vitro and in tumor models in vivo   The selection of various viral IFN I antagonists that potentially could be used to augment attenuated oncolytic viruses is vast   
For example  increased replication of several viruses  including HIV  Sindbis virus and E deleted adenovirus in mammalian cells was observed when the cells were engineered to express vaccinia virus E L protein  influenza A virus NS  protein  ebola virus VP  protein or HIV  Tat protein   
The choice of antagonist must primarily be made with safety in mind  but virus specific and cell specific differences in antagonist functions may potentially be exploited rationally when considering the overall combination 
For example  vaccinia virus E L is able to rescue VSV but not EMCV from exogenous IFN  whereas vaccinia virus K L partially rescued EMCV but not VSV   In anticipation of systematic  perhaps bioinformatically guided   super chimera  studies  two or more viruses that may complement each other s shortcomings in antiviral defense antagonism have been considered 
Notably  vaccinia virus was favorably combined with IFN I sensitive oncolytic VSV and SFV  yielding tumor model dependent increases in overall therapy efficacy that were dependent on vaccinia virus antagonism of type I IFN responses  which increased the replication of the IFN sensitive viruses   
Such heterologous virotherapy approaches may also be used to generate immunological synergy  similar to heterologous prime boost vaccination  anti tumor immune responses may be increased due to targeting of the tumor by two different viruses  on two separate occasions  but anti virus immune responses would be generated against different viruses each time  avoiding the problem of neutralizing immunity to and predominance of antivirus immune responses   
Some other ideas explored experimentally include engineering oncolytic viruses to express other oncolytic viruses 
For example  the entire oncolytic parvovirus H  genome was placed under a regulatable promoter in oncolytic adenovirus  resulting in a more effective therapeutic entity than either virus alone without loss of tumor specificity   
The genetic material of Semliki Forest virus replicons has been engineered into adenovirus and vaccinia virus backbones   and several other virus chimeras have been constructed   
However  the effects on tumor antiviral defenses of such a constructs remain to be studied The attribute  oncolytic  implies for a virus that it infects and  indeed  lyses the infected tumor 
This property is primarily tested in vitro in cultured tumor cells 
We have learned  however  that in the native tumor microenvironment in living hosts many viruses are no longer able to infect tumor cells or to kill them even if they manage to infect them 
Tightly packed tumor cells and the network of supportive molecules of the extracellular matrix form a physical barrier to virus particle diffusion 
It has also become evident that the tumor cells themselves may be much more capable of thwarting oncolytic virus advances than previously thought  with some tumor cells residing in a seemingly permanent non permissive antiviral state 
Tumors harbor multiple cell types in addition to the neoplastic cells  which may promote and propagate both physical and cellular virus resistance 
As the efficacy of virotherapy in human cancer patients still falls shy of the achievements in animal models  it appears quite plausible that one or more of the barriers described in this review indeed constitute a real and formidable obstacle for oncolytic virus advancement into routine clinical use 
Fortunately  some of the most difficult barriers have been identified  and a rapidly expanding arsenal of countermeasures is at our disposal 
Our task is now to separate the wheat from the chaff and to systematically evaluate the proposed combination regimens that will yield the best results without compromising patient safety Evidence of prenatal toxicity of herbal based indigenous formulations for sex selection in rat modelsTraditional or indigenous preparations  IPs  are getting considerable attention in global health debates  It continues to be used widely in several countries and its consumption is rapidly increasing 
 
  Many reports have documented the use of such preparations 
For instance  in China  traditional herbal medicines played a critical role during the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome  SARS  In fact  many drugs in modern medicine had their roots in the traditional system of medicine 
Drugs like Penicillin  from Penicillium fungi  and Digoxin  from Digitalis purpurea  are some such examples 
One of the promising therapies for Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus  MRSA  infection is a ninth century treatment for eye infections which is a recipe consisting of garlic and onions  wine  and bile from a cow s stomach brewed in a brass cauldron 
It is however important to note that culture specific practices are not always safe 
Digitalis is a classic example where herbalists use this plant in allopathic treatment strategies  while in some countries such as Britain  law restricts their vast availability  A report from Australia describes the adverse effects of ‘herbal  preparations or IPs  Problems arise when people do not report about the consumption of such preparations assuming that these are devoid of any side effects by virtue of them being natural products  The need for research in this field is huge and scientific research into the quality  safety  molecular effects and clinical efficacy is crucial 
 
 
Pregnancy is considered a time of minimal intervention  and a period when herbal medicines are usually contraindicated  It is reported that many women consume indigenous medicines  that contains Bryonia laciniosa  Quercus infectoria and Putranjiva roxburghii along with other ingredients  during early pregnancy to beget a male child in India 
These preparations  often called sex selection drugs  SSD  contain herbal ingredients but these are off the label prescriptions and hence cannot be certified as ‘herbal  medicines 
The prevalence of consumption varies from   to as high as         Studies have indicated that there is  –  times higher risk of birth defects including major malformations of internal organs like urogenital and renal malformation  trachea esophageal fistula  and visible defects like spina bifida  cleft lip palate and imperforate anus 
 
  Risk of stillbirths also increases   folds 
Studies suggest that a single exposure during pregnancy can be deleterious 
 
 
 
  SSDs are reported to contain phytoestrogens  steroids and heavy metals 
 
 
 
  It is also known that although placenta serves as a barrier  most drugs and environmental chemicals enter the foetal circulation by passive diffusion or active transport  However  despite growing evidence on deleterious effects of these herbal formulations  few studies have attempted to systematically understand the risk of such preparations using animal models 
Genetic sex of a child is determined at the time of conception by the fertilization of the ovum with X or Y sperms and intake of so called preparations for sex selection can never alter that In view of these  the current study was conducted with an objective to determine the embryo foetal and development toxicity of SSDs following maternal exposure during critical period of organogenesis using a small animal model The study was guided by the OECD guidelines for testing of chemicals  Guideline no    adopted on  nd January   Prenatal Developmental Toxicity Study  and was based on a mutually approved protocol

The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee  Venus Medicine Research Center 
Due permission was taken from the Ethics Committee of Indian Institute of Public Health Delhi For this experiment  strain of Sprague Dawley of rats  Rattus norvegicus  was used 
The number of dams per group was   instead of   as laid down under OECD guidelines 
Rats of both sexes  –  g  were obtained from National Institute of Biologicals  India at  –  weeks of age  acclimatized for five days and then subjected to the experiment at  –  weeks of age 
They were housed in standard polypropylene rat cages with stainless steel top grill  one dam per cage  at a temperature of       °C  with  –  relative humidity 
Bedding material and cages were changed once in six days and   hourly light dark cycle was followed 
Animals were identified by their existing ear numbering 
Cages were labelled by tags indicating the study number  sex  group of the animals  experimental start and completion dates 
Standard pelleted feed  from Ashirwad Industries  Mohali  India  was provided ad libitum to all the animals 
They also had free access to purified water via drinking bottles throughout the study 
The feed  cages and drinking bottles were not analysed for the presence of phytoestrogens and bisphenol A 
However  similar materials were used for all the rats across all groups The drug comprised of IPs for sex selection  SSD 
These non branded locally made preparations are made available  –  days after placing an order and are never sold openly 
These preparations essentially contain herbal ingredients such as Shivlingi  Bryonia laciniosa  Majuphal  Quercus infectoria  Putrajeevak  Putranjiva roxburghii  Nagkesar  Mesua ferrea  and feather of peacock  Pavo cristatus 
A total of   such samples of SSDs were procured from varied sources like ‘pansari  shop owners  grocers  local alternative medicine practitioners  rickshaw pullers  drivers and commoners from different states 
SSDs are advised to be consumed between   and   weeks of pregnancy The samples were categorized into   groups based on redundancy of the preparations and common ingredients reported 
This was followed by chemical analysis in an accredited laboratory to detect the presence of phytoestrogens and steroids 
Since we explored the toxic effects of these preparations we wanted to select two samples that would be most predictive of toxicity 
Due to resource constraints  we did not want to subject all the   samples for animal study 
Hence  three samples of SSDs  found to be most rich in phenols and steroids were selected for toxicity study  All the three samples were also tested for heavy metals which suggested that Lead and Mercury were in very high quantities  The toxicity was examined using C  elegans  an alternate animal model 
Survival analysis and reproductive toxicity was assessed from the brood size and progeny count assay  The two SSDs that were found to be most toxic were selected as test items for the subsequent study in rat models 
SSD   was reported to contain Shivlingi and Putrajeevak while SSD   contained Shivlingi  Majuphal  Putrajeevak  Nagkesar and feathers of peacock 
Both the samples were obtained from grocers 
Local preparations like these are bound to have certain degree of variability in concentrations but more often than not  these remain the major ingredients According to studies reported  women consume such preparations along with cow s milk in dosages and schedule that are quite varied 
While some advise these IPs to be consumed for one day  others prescribe it for   days  to be taken thrice a day 
We considered the amount of SSDs most commonly reported by pregnant women  weighing   kg  which was  –  g daily for   days 
The dose of the test item   mg kg  was calculated by using conversion factor of  Conversion factor is the ratio of the correction factors  estimated by dividing the average body weight in kgs of species by the body surface area in m  of the species  Km

On the day of dosing  the doses were administered between  –  h  The test items were administered in fresh cow s milk at a final volume of   ml kg 
The doses were calculated on the basis of the latest body weight recorded for the study 
A stainless steel gavage cannula fitted to a calibrated syringe was used for dosing the animals For control animals  cow s milk was used as a vehicle while feeding The study was performed in two phases to evaluate the effect of SSD consumption duration during gestation period Adult  nulliparous female rats were mated with males of same species and strain in  
Each morning  dams were examined for the presence of a vaginal plug and vaginal smear was taken from each dam by using pipette smear technique 
The day of vaginal plug formation or sperms observed in vaginal smear  also known as successful mating  were considered as GD   Gestation day  
The mated females were housed individually in clear polycarbonate cages with stainless steel wire lids 
Mating process was carried out to result in   pregnant animals per group 
Successfully mated females were randomized into control and treatment groups 
All the rats were sacrificed on GD  
According to OECD guidelines  the test chemical should be administered daily from implantation to the day prior to scheduled caesarean section in order to assess toxicity 
Test chemicals were administered to pregnant animals and sacrificed as per the schedule  which was as close as possible to the normal day of delivery without risking loss of data resulting from early delivery i e GD  
The females were killed  before caesarean section  the uterine contents were examined  and the fetuses were evaluated for soft tissue and skeletal changes The pregnant rats were randomized to two intervention and one control groups

Body weights were recorded on days               and on terminal day before sacrifice 
These recorded body weights were used for calculating the dose volume to be administered •Food consumption  Food consumption was evaluated once after successful mating or on day   of gestation  the day of vaginal plug formation or sperms observed in vaginal smear  and on days             and one day prior to sacrifice 
Calculated amount of feed were placed in the trough of each cage and the quantity of feed remaining after approximately   h were weighed and recorded •Morbidity Mortality  All the animals were observed twice daily  once in the morning between   and   h and once in the evening between   and   h  for incidence of morbidity and or mortality •Maternal examination related parameters  At the end of the observation period  all the dams were sequentially euthanized  by CO  asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation  and subjected to gross necropsy 
After termination  dams were examined macroscopically for any structural abnormalities or pathological changes 
Blinding was done while evaluation of the dams during caesarean section and subsequent foetal analyses to minimize bias 
Pregnancy rate was calculated as the proportion of mated pairs that had produced at least one pregnancy within a fixed period where pregnancy was determined by the earliest available evidence that fertilization has occurred 
Gestation index was calculated to indicate number of females with live born as a proportion of number of females with evidence of pregnancy •Examination of uterine contents  Immediately after termination  the uteri were removed and the pregnancy status of the animals ascertained 
Gravid uteri including the cervix were weighed  and number of corpora lutea were determined 
The uterine contents were examined for numbers of embryonic or foetal deaths and live foetuses 
The degree of resorption was described in order to estimate the relative time of death of the conceptus 
Any increase in the number of resorption and or implantation loss is an indicator of litter size for the individual dam •Examination of foetuses  The sex and weight of each foetus were determined 
Approximately one half of each litter were prepared and examined for skeletal alterations from selected dams 
The remainder were prepared and examined for soft tissue alterations  using accepted or appropriate serial sectioning methods or careful gross dissection techniques 
Each foetus was examined for external alterations 
Foetuses were examined for skeletal alterations  using Alizarin Red S staining method 
The fetuses for skeletal staining were kept in pre labelled plastic containers containing   ethanol before staining 
After skinning  we processed the foetus for staining by immersing in   alcian blue   GX for three days  then performed rehydration through a gradient series of ethanol   ethanol   –  h twice    ethanol   –  h  ethanol   –  h  distilled water until the samples sank to the bottom of a conical tube 
Samples were further treated with   KOH for  –  days or until it became clear and again treated with   alizarin red for next  –  days until bones became purple 
Samples were rinsed   times in   KOH  for  –  h at each time point 
Samples were further treated with a gradient series of glycerol  KOH    h   glycerol   h X  Visceral examination was done by micro dissection technique 
Fetuses were preserved in   formalin until they became fixed 
An illuminated magnifier was used for visceral examination 
We placed the foetus in a supine position on a paraffin wax block tray covered with paraffin wax  secured the fetal limbs by paper pins to the paraffin wax block  made a ventral midline incision from the umbilicus  cutting caudally to the genital tubercle and cranially to the diaphragm 
Once incision was completed  we located the ventral attachment of the diaphragm and lifted the liver carefully to examine the diaphragm for abnormal opening 
After observation  the diaphragm was clipped 
We gave a longitudinal cut to open the rib cage slightly lateral to and on the right of the sternebrae and then extended the cut anteriorly to neck region 
The rib cage was opened gently and secured to the paraffin block petridish tray with pins Foetuses were examined for soft tissue alterations  e g 
variations and malformations or anomalies  using Wilson s Technique 
The fetal viscera were examined sequentially  beginning with thoracic organs and moving caudally 
We performed hearts cuts after completion of other observations 
We examined the bilobed thymus for size  shape  coloration and presence of haemorrhages and then removed it for observation of trachea and esophagus 
We observed the lungs for size  color and number of lobes  observed the trachea  esophagus for normal alignment and presence of fistula  opened the pericardial sac and cut off pericardium to expose the heart for observation 
We checked the size  shape  color of the heart and normal development of major blood vessels 
After observation of thoracic viscera  we observed the abdominal viscera and liver for size  shape  color  texture  and number of lobes 
External anatomy of heart was examined by making two incisions using micro dissecting scissors We examined the stomach  spleen  pancreas  small and large intestines for size  position or any other developmental anomalies 
The intestines were moved aside after observation for seeing the underlying structures 
Ureters were checked for normal size and location and for continuity from the renal hilus to the urinary bladder 
One kidney was cut transversely and another was longitudinally to examine renal papilla and renal pelvis 
To confirm the sex of the foetus  the gonads were inspected carefully 
We examined the reproductive organs for size  shape and location GraphPad Prism® statistical software version   was used to analyze the data and all the results were represented as mean   S E M 
Intergroup variance for most of the parameters was calculated by one way analysis of variance  ANOVA  followed by Tukey s test 
A value of p     was regarded statistically significant 
Linear regression was performed to examine the weight change of dams during pregnancy for each group comparing with the control after adjusting for the litter size 
The malformations were analysed by performing Chi square test for trend for two groups  SSD  G  G  G  G  and SSD  G  G  G  G The ARRIVE guidelines were followed to report the findings 
In phase   pre natal study  all the dams dosed with SSD  and SSD  had normal food intake and weight gain 
The average gain in weight from GD  to GD   was       gms for controls while it was       gms in SSD   and       gms in SSD 
 Webtable  
No test item related mortality or clinical sign of toxicity was encountered during the study 
All dams in treatment groups and control group survived to scheduled terminal sacrifice 
They showed normal behaviour until euthanized 
There were no differences in mean maternal body weights  body weight gains  pregnancy rate  gestational index  pre and post implantation loss  and resorptions 
No significant differences were observed in foetal sex ratio  foetal body weights 
However  one dam from SSD  had all male foetuses 
No abnormality was detected in skeletal and visceral examination In phase   controls and SSD  and SSD  treated dams exhibited a comparable food intake  Table  
 
However  a dose response relationship was observed with reduced weight gain with higher doses of SSDs 
 Table  
 
Two dams  one in G   SSD    mg kg  and the other in G   SSD    mg kg  categories showed decreased or consistent body weight GD  onwards 
On an average  the weight on GD   was       gms in controls while it was       with SSD    mg kg  and       gms with SSD    mg kg 
The adjusted analysis indicated that except in G  there was a significant reduction in weight gain in all the intervention groups as compared to the control group after controlling for litter size  Table  
 During follow up  one dam from SSD    mg kg  and one from SSD    mg kg  showed haematuria during gestational day  – 
However  no another clinical sign of toxicity was encountered during the study 
All the dams in treatment and control groups showed normal behaviour and survived to scheduled terminal sacrifice 
In phase   pregnancy rate and gestational index were found to be   at all dose levels with SSD  whereas  in SSD  it decreased to   in G   SSD    mg kg  and G   SSD    mg kg  groups 
One dam from G   SSD    mg kg  and another one from G   SSD    mg kg  group showed mating confirmation during vaginal smear examination and showed positive sign in initial days of pregnancy but during necropsy on expected day of delivery  GD   no foetus was found 
Body weights of dams increased in the initial stages that became constant at a later period 
To reconfirm it  non gravid uterus was stained in salewski strain and presence of conceptus was found 
This indicated the possibility of miscarriage Increased pre and post implantation losses as well as resorptions and reduced live foetuses were observed with both SSD  and SSD 
No significant differences were observed in foetal sex ratio  but decreased foetal body weights were noted in both sexes 
On an average one early resorption in a group was a normal observation 
More than one late resorption was observed in all treatment groups while there was none in the control group 
Total count of live foetuses count was significantly reduced with SSD  and SSD  treatment in a dose dependent manner 
Total number of live foetuses were reduced up to   in SSD  at   mg kg treatment group and   in SSD  at   mg kg treatment group Both SSD  and SSD s at different dose levels showed decreased fetal weight in dose dependent manner  although the difference was not significant 
Skeletal and soft tissue alterations were observed in both treatment groups 
In general  the embryo–foetal examination showed abnormalities  which could have caused some functional damage to these foetuses if allowed to grow in the normal course 
In visceral examinations  slight dilation of the renal pelvis  reduced papilla size  urinary bladder hypertrophy was observed in few foetuses from both SSD  and SSD  treatment groups 
Few incidences of foetal soft tissue abnormalities encountered in this study were normal variants 
Skeletal examination showed variations in the ossification patterns like incomplete or poorly ossified skulls  ossification of sternebra  cleavage ossification of thoracic centrum  asymmetric thoracic centrum  and supernumerary rib in many foetuses in SSD  and SSD  groups  Table  
 
A trend was noted with increased incidence of certain malformations with increasing dosages of SSDs that was statistically significant for most malformations with SSD The results of this developmental toxicity study suggest that administration of SSDs to pregnant rats had significant impact on intrauterine foetal growth  early and late resorption as well as developmental anomalies 
These formulations have teratogenic potential but does not affect sex ratio IPs contain phytoestrogens like diadzein and genistein  In vitro rat whole embryo culture assay  WEC  studies of genistein in rats have indicated fetotoxic and teratogenic potential at concentration of ≥  μg mL  However  in vivo  an oral  gavage  embryonic and fetal development pilot study could not demonstrate any teratogenic effect in the same study 
These findings are different from our study probably because we used SSDs containing natural herbal and non herbal ingredients unlike those studies where synthetic genistein was used 
In both the studies  decreased body weight was observed indicating slight maternal toxicity 
Food consumption was unaffected in our study which is contrary to what was reported 
In another study  pregnant rats exposed to oral isoflavones  diadzein and genistein in varying combinations  showed alterations in the number of live foetuses  lysed foetuses  number of resorption sites  and implantation sites while no clinical signs suggestive of maternal toxicity  seizures  tremors and salivation  that was observed similar to our study 
Maternal mass gain was significantly reduced in rats treated with   mg kg of isoflavones  Ratio of females to males in the litter of different groups was similar akin to our finding  These observations clearly nullify the claim that consumption of SDDs could alter the sex of the growing foetus 
An analysis done by the same authors earlier revealed that SSDs contain testosterone and steroids 
 
  The prenatal testosterone in pregnancy is known to affect sexual development adversely      The principles of reproductive biology state that the genetic sex of an individual is determined at the time of conception and can never be altered under any circumstances 
However  phenotypic sex of the growing foetus is likely to be influenced by the hormonal milieu of in utero environment 
Our analysis was confined to phenotypic sex only and hence it is difficult to state if any differences existed with reference to genetic and phenotypic sex 
This requires further inquiry Evidence on the effects of SSDs on humans should best be obtained from human beings 
The findings of the current study corroborate well with the evidence generated from observational studies in human beings      Presence of skeletal and visceral malformations could explain why stillbirths are likely to be more in women who consume SSDs 
The dosing of the test drugs was intended not only to examine the period of organogenesis solely but to assess effects from preimplantation  through the entire period of gestation to the day before caesarean section 
The results were based on observations of more than   female animals with implantation sites at necropsy that added to its strength 
Unnecessary handling of pregnant animals as well as any stressors from outside was avoided 
At least three dose levels and a concurrent vehicle control were used with dams randomly allocated to different treatment groups that support the validity of the results 
However  absence of   rats per group does not support it to be a fully OECD compliant study 
We did follow the principles of Good Laboratory Practices  GLP  but due to constraints of resources the study could not be conducted as a GLP compliant study  though this is optimal for academic interests There is a lack of systematic approach to assess the safety and effectiveness of herbal preparations 
Ingredients for herbal medicines are often drawn from different sources and are used in combination  which may exhibit variability in terms of species  growing conditions  and biologically active constituents 
To isolate each active ingredient from each herb and then to establish its toxicity is time consuming  resource intensive and not practical 
Moreover  drug approval process does not accommodate undifferentiated mixtures  Though important  it surpasses the herb herb interaction and the potentiating effect of one compound over another 
Therefore  in our study  we administered the herbal mixture to assess the effects 
Real time evaluations have yielded important observations for several herbal drugs especially related to pregnancy 
For instance  Wang et al 
  used mice model to evaluate the adverse pregnancy outcomes after maternal exposure to the herbal medicines  particularly during early pregnancy  The major events included maternal and perinatal mortality 
Maternal weight gain  embryo growth and post natal weight gain were significantly decreased 
Moreover  foetal resorption and skeletal malformations were increased  signifying potential toxicity of Chinese herbal medicines 
This is comparable to our findings To conclude  the results of this developmental toxicity study suggest that administration of SSD  and SSD  to pregnant rats exerted significant impact on intrauterine foetal growth and development without any effect on sex ratio when administered during the period of organogenesis

It is therefore natural to expect that the distribution of amino acids  across all protein sequences  would appear to be fixed  given no mutations over a specific period of time 
Of the   naturally occurring amino acids  each seems to appear randomly located at a particular position within the sequence of a protein 
However  when the sequences of a group of proteins are compared to one another  specific patterns begin to emerge 
These patterns are commonly referred to as motifs and frequently produce similar structural elements and in many cases  similar functions between the proteins that contain them 
In recent years  significant efforts have been made to reduce sequences into discrete motifs  so that each can be linked to some specific biological function based on particular rules      
Databases that consist of identifiable amino acid motifs  such as PROSITE  Pratt and EMOTIF  have been constructed to allow researchers an easy classification of unknown proteins into families based on their common motifs               
All of these methods share one property  they depend on specific alignment algorithms  such as the basic local alignment search tool  BLAST or PSI BLAST  to perform the sequence comparison between diverse families of proteins being analyzed      
These methods have already led to a number of key discoveries and offer the promise of determining biologically meaningful information about function from a protein s primary sequence It is generally accepted that a strong correlation exists between a protein s amino acid sequence and its resulting structure and function         
Techniques that can quickly determine significant similarities between protein sequences are valuable in predicting an unknown protein s function within the cell 
Here we describe a procedure that  by computing the frequency of key amino acid pairs  can quickly classify large groups of proteins into functional groups 
In order to uncover any relevant amino acid strings  we have utilized statistical methods applicable to datasets with large fluctuations in the search of human protein sequences within both the Swiss Prot and Complete Human Genebank databases The goal of this manuscript is to demonstrate how these two residue motifs can be used to develop rapid methods for searching protein or genomic databases in order to locate potentially interesting or aberrant protein sequences 
As an example  we describe the distribution of select amino acid pairs within the genome of the Coronavirus  Tor  which is responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome  SARS    
We have examined additional sets  but the limited format of this paper precludes a large presentation of potential applications The set of all   naturally occurring  amino acids are described by their standard single letter representations  and are taken as the complete set contained within all protein sequences as shown below Zq A R N D C Q E G H I L K M F P S T W Y V Residues that are arranged in a certain order can be referred to as vectors and are represented symbolically as b n b b bn bj Zq The coordinates of each vector represent the amino acid symbols contained within any given protein  where n is the total length of the vector 
The collection of all vectors b n  in the proteome can therefore be denoted simply by Zq n The underlying structure of a protein sequence  which is the order of the amino acids  has unique and identifiable characteristics 
As an analogy  in written English  the letter q is almost always followed by u 
Also  the frequency of the word  and  is much higher than that of the related three letter strings   nad   nda   dan  and  dna  which are simply permutations of the same set of individual letters to construct a word with a different meaning 
Utilizing similar characteristics  we can intuitively scan for unique sequence vectors contained within any given protein 
We expand on these characteristics  by utilizing the concepts of affinity and order stability in Section  Using the entire Swiss Prot database  release number   as the basis for our calculations  we have constructed a probability table for the occurrence of the   naturally occurring amino acids  see Table  
    
In addition to the Swiss Prot database  we have also included data from Complete Human Genebank  NCBI Build Number   March    as a source for all characterized and hypothetical human protein sequences We use the symbol Ω to denote the Swiss Prot database  and the letter M to denote the number of proteins in the database  
Hence we can state that Ω As s M  where As a a as Ns  is the sth protein  ai with i Zq is the ith amino acid in the sequence  and Ns is the length of the protein sequence As 
For any vector b n  if there is a sequence As in Ω such that b n  is a segment of As  then we can say b n  occurs in Ω 
We can then use NΩ b n  to denote the total number of outcomes that b n  has occurred in Ω  and let NΩ n  be the total number of all vectors occurring in Ω with length n  Therefore p b n NΩ b n NΩ n is the probability that the vector b n  occurs in Ω 
We then introduce k p q b n log p b n q b n where p b n  and q b n  are any two probability distributions on Zq n  and b n  belongs to Zq n 
The quantity k p q b n  in Eq 
  is defined for any two probability distributions p b n  and q b n  on Zq n  where the distribution q arises from independent letter  i e  amino acid  probabilities 
Then  k p q b n  can be viewed as a random variable about b n  and its probability distribution is defined as follows F p q x PI k p q b n ⩽x b n k p q b n ⩽xp b n The expectation value μ p q  and variance σ p q  of p b n  are expressed mathematically as μ p q b n Zq n p b n k p q b n 
 σ p q b n Zq n p b n k p q b n μ p q  Hence we see that μ p q  is simply the Kullback–Leibler entropy   
As a consequence  μ p q  is always non negative and μ p q  if and only if p b n q b n 
As a result  the amino acid sequence of b n  can be represented by k p q b n In Eq 
  the probability distributions p  q in the k p q b n  have several possible values 
For example  if we let p be the probability of b n  and only change the value of q in k p q b n  we obtain the following expression q b n j np bj p b p b p bn Based on Eqs 
  and   the value of k p q b n  gives us the affinity for all amino acids within vector b n 
Here two situations are identified as especially interesting i When k p q b n  implies that among the amino acids in vector b n  there is an increased affinity 
That is  the vector b n  occurs more frequently than expected 
 ii When k p q b n  implies that among the amino acids in vector b n  there is a decreased affinity 
That is  the vector b n  occurs less frequently than expected In a similar approach to the condition described above  we may choose q b n p πn b n  where πn b n  is a permutation of b n  and πn denotes a permutation transform 
In this case  the order sensitivity of b n  can also be reflected by the value of k p q b n  and produces the following outcomes i when k p q b n  implies that b n  occurs much more often than πn b n ii when k p q b n  implies that πn b n  occurs much more often than b n In addition to the concepts of affinity and order sensitivity  we can also design other analysis techniques by choosing alternate representations of q b n 
Quantifying the terms k p q b n  we can represent vector frequency numerically 
In cases where k p q b n μ p q ⩾ σ p q  the corresponding vector b n  is called  positive  while in those cases where the opposite takes place  k p q b n μ p q ⩽ σ p q  the vector b n  is called  negative 
By judiciously choosing a   equal to   we obtained   two residue  positive pairs  and   two residue negative pairs  see Table  
  out of a total of   possibilities of amino acid pairs Using any one of the positive motifs from Table   we can develop a test method to detect changes in their distribution through any protein database 
If b b b  is  positive  then p b b μ σp b p b  where p ⋅  is the probability of the amino acids or vectors ⋅ in the database 
Since NΩ μ M Nμ p bj NΩ bj μ MNμ we have NΩ b μ M Nμ μ MNμ μ σp b NΩ b or NΩ b μ M Nμ μ MNμ μ σp b NΩ b and since μ M Nμ is very close to μ MNμfor Swiss Prot database we have NΩ b μ σp b NΩ b and NΩ b μ σp b NΩ b As a consequence of Eq 
  the detection of a deleterious mutation based on the increased appearance of an arbitrary string of these residues becomes possible 
For example  according to Table   CC is an attractive motif with   then NΩ CC μ σp C μ M Nμ μ MNμNΩ C ≈ μ σp C NΩ C Let Ns CC  and Ns C  be the number of CC and the number of C in the sth protein 
Then we have NΩ CC NΩ C  because μ σ  and p C  since NΩ CC s MNs CC NΩ C s MNs C Based upon the result that the CC pair represents a rare event  proteins satisfying Ns CC Ns C  as defined in Eq 
  suddenly become interesting 
We can therefore consider the number Ns CC  as an index to develop detection methods to test for the presence of a CC containing protein within a database 
Using this same reasoning  one can also use any other one of the remaining motifs in Table   to develop detection methods for additional proteins In an identical fashion to the previous example using the positive two residue motifs in Table   we can also use any of the  negative  two residue motifs to develop search methods 
For example  the CM pair is a  negative  two residue  word  with  
That is  p CM μ σp C p M 
Using identical arguments to those described in Section   we obtain NΩ CM NΩ M  and NΩ CM NΩ C 
Since both Ns M  and Ns C  are small numbers for fixed proteins  the overall number of CM pairs in most proteins should be close to zero 
Therefore  we can also use any of the remaining seven  negative  motifs in Table   to develop additional detection methods In contrast to the CC motif  the total number of proteins in the Swiss Prot database having more than one CM pair is quite small 
For example  among the   proteins contained within this database  the number of proteins such that Ns CM ⩾  is   and the number of proteins satisfying the condition Ns CM ⩾  is only  
For human proteins in Swiss Prot  the total number of proteins containing CM pairs is   and there are only   proteins that satisfy Ns CM ⩾   Table  
However  we would expect to find about   proteins having CM pairs in the Swiss Prot database  based upon the amino acid frequencies given in Table   which is greater than the number observed Cysteine rich proteins and the presence of CC pairs in proteins are both concepts that have been studied previously      
If we combine these two concepts and describe them in mathematical terms  we observe that the rates q Ns C Ns and q Ns CC Ns C  describe these two conditions  where Ns  Ns C  and Ns CC  are the numbers of all amino acids  cysteine  and CC  respectively 
We can then derive proteinsNs C Ns p C σ Ns CC Ns C p ξτ C ξτ C σ where σ  and σ  are the standard deviations about Ns C Nss Mand Ns CC Ns C s M respectively We have found the following computational results based on Swiss Prot database σ ≈ σ ≈ andp ξτ C ξτ C ⩾ p C For   we have a much simpler method to determine that a protein sequence is both C  and CC rich if proteinsNs C Ns ∩proteinsNs CC Ns C So  a much simpler method to test whether a protein is a both C  and CC rich for   isNumber of CC  Number of C Number of C  Length of protein Using this principle  we found a total of eight proteins that are both C  and CC rich within the Swiss Prot database For   there is an easier method to determine whether a protein sequence is both C  and CC rich if proteinsNs C Ns ∩proteinsNs CC Ns C So  a much simpler method to test whether a protein is both C  and CC rich for   is based on the inequalitiesNumber of CC  Number of C Number of C  Length of protein Using this principle  we can get a total of   proteins that are both C  and CC rich within the entire Swiss Prot database For   there is also an easier method to determine if a protein sequence is both C  and CC rich sequence when proteinsNs C Ns ∩proteinsNs CC Ns C So  a much simpler method to test whether a protein is both C  and CC rich for   is based on the inequalitiesNumber of CC  Number of C Number of C Length of protein Using this principle  we have identified a total of   proteins that are both C  and CC rich within the Swiss Prot database 
From these results  it becomes clear that there are many C rich proteins and many CC rich proteins that are not mutually inclusive 
The sets of both C  and CC rich proteins are only subsets of the set containing all C rich proteins or that containing all CC rich proteins Because the Swiss Prot database is somewhat biased to those proteins that are of interest to researchers  we have decided to examine a database that was  in essence  complete 
For this  we chose the human subset sequences contained within the Complete Human Genebank database 
This was the most complete and readily available source of human genetic sequences and should therefore provide us with an accurate representation of both CC and CM pair distributions 
We observed that the total number of CC pairs within the human subset of sequences contained in Genebank  a total of   proteins  was  
These pairs were contained within a total of   proteins  Table   a number that is substantially larger than the   we obtained from Swiss Prot data  Table  
Since the total number of amino acids in The Complete Human Genebank is   we can easily get the expected number of CC in Complete Human Genebank is   which is much less than this actual value  
The same also holds true for the CM pair  where we would expect to see   CM pairs  but actually observe    Table  
 
This result is surprising but true and shows that there are fundamental difference between the Human and other species in terms of the frequency of CC and CM pairs To create a single CM pair  it is obvious that one needs only a single C  If a protein sequence also contains a CC pair  the total number of cysteines available to create a CM pair has been reduced by a factor of  
Using the cutoff value of four CC pairs as statistically significant  we determined the probability of finding a CM pair within proteins that already contained a CC pair  Table  
Even though both CC and CM can occur in the same protein  the total number of proteins in Genebank that contain both CC and CM pairs is   and these pairs almost always occur at different locations in the sequence 
However  in some rare cases the second C within the CC pair is shared with the first C within the CM pair  giving us a new triplet CCM If we filter the set of proteins described above for redundant entries  we obtain a set of   unique proteins that contain the CCM triplet in the human proteome 
Using the probability distributions obtained from Swiss Prot  we obtained the probability of CCM as  
Since the total of all protein lengths in the Swiss Prot database is   there should be a total of   CCM triplets 
This value is almost identical to the predicted number of CCM of  
This result suggests that the CCM triplet at least in Swiss Prot occurs randomly 
However  we can also analyze the CCM probability using a different approach  putting q CCM p CC p M  into Eq 
 
If CCM occurs randomly  then we have p CCM p C p C p M  and since p CC μ σp C p C  we will get k p q CCM log p CCM q CCM log p C p CC ⩽ μ σ Based on Eq 
  it is clear that the presence of a CC pair strongly excludes M  Therefore  the probability of the CCM triplet should occur less frequently than that of CC or M individually We have obtained the following statistical results with regard to the total number of CC and CM pairs contained in the Swiss Prot database i The total number of these proteins satisfying Ns CC ⩾  is   and   of these are found in humans 
 ii The total number of human proteins in Ω that satisfy Ns CC ⩾  is  
 iii The total number of the proteins in Ω that satisfy Ns CM ⩾  is     of these are found in humans 
 iv The total number of human proteins in Ω that satisfy Ns CM ⩾  is only  
The genome of the SARS associated Coronavirus contains a total of   open reading frames  which code for six characterized and five uncharacterized proteins   
After examining the complete proteome the SARS associated Coronavirus we observed a statistically significant increase in the occurrence of the CC and CM pairs in the SARS associated Coronavirus  genome Of the   putative proteins  four contain either CC or CM pairs 
Two large poly proteins  GI  and GI  contain   CC and   CM pairs  as well as   CC and   CM pairs  respectively 
The putative spike glycoprotein  GI    contains   CC and   CM  while the small envelope protein  GI    contains only   CC pair 
The remaining   proteins  of which two have been identified as a nucleocapsid and matrix protein  contain no CC or CM pairs 
When compared to the occurrence of CC and CM pairs within all human proteins found in the Swiss Prot database  it becomes clear that there is an increased occurrence of these pairs within the SARS associated Coronavirus proteome It is clear that the frequency of CC and CM pairs is significantly higher in the SARS genome than it is in the human genome 
It is our hope that these unique two residue motifs could be used as a means of identifying a virus such as SARS 
While currently impossible to determine  one can see a possible clinical use for determining the frequency of CC or CM pairs in an individual 
If a person has been infected by SARS  we would expect the numbers of CC and CM pairs to be much higher than in a healthy individual 
If we were then able to develop a clinically feasible technique that could identify the CC or CM pair content in total cellular protein  without damaging the cell  it could be possible to implement a detection method simply by counting the numbers of CC or CM pairs in all proteins examined 
If the presence of increased CC or CM pairs was indicative of infection by SARS we could develop new drugs to inhibit the translation of proteins that contain these pairs within infected cells 
As a very specific example  this could be accomplished through the use of specific tRNA mimics that could block translating ribosome when these pairs appear at the P and A site simultaneously      
While tRNA mimics could normally be seen as non specific protein synthesis inhibitors  the lower frequency of the CC or CM motifs in host proteins as compared to the relatively high occurrence in viral protein provide a starting point for the analysis of treatments using methods such as these In this paper we have performed a detailed search of the Swiss Prot and Complete Human Genebank database in relation to the frequencies of each of the   natural amino acids and motifs made up of two residues 
This has provided us with a new insight into the distribution of proteins within these databases and the information that may be contained within a protein s primary amino acid sequence 
Our focus in this quest has been to examine specific pairs or triplets of residues and use probability theory to assess whether or not particular strings of residues occur more frequently than their probability would indicate 
By analyzing affinity and anti affinity  we developed a procedure to search out all two  and three residue clusters within these databases 
Through this technique  we can rapidly classify large groups of proteins into families based on the occurrence of these motifs 
Combining this concept with a specific knowledge of protein function  we propose novel ideas aimed at developing fast detection methods for specific diseases based on the unusually high occurrence of some of these motifs when compared with the expected probabilities 
A timely example of the application of this method is given  namely the analysis of the SARS virus 
This method will hopefully lead to the discovery of new diagnostic techniques and possible treatment of diseases  by recognizing the location of target domains in the expressed sequence Cell type specific expression of the putative SARS CoV  receptor ACE  in human heartsThe coronavirus disease    COVID  caused by SARS CoV  infections imposes a major threat for the world s healthcare systems and is leading to thousands of deaths 
Angiotensin converting enzyme    ACE  has been identified as a potential receptor for SARS coronavirus  and is also considered the main receptor for SARS CoV  SARS CoV  binds to ACE  via its glycosylated outer membrane spike proteins 
ACE  is highly expressed in the lung and heart  and is known for its vital role in the cardiovascular system –  Although SARS CoV  mainly invades alveolar epithelial cells  it can also cause myocardial injury  as assessed by increased troponin T and NT proBNP levels accompanying increased cardiovascular symptoms in COVID infected patients  It is unclear whether elevated biomarkers of cardiac injury  or long term effects on the cardiovascular system  are directly caused by viral infection of cardiac tissue or are secondary to hypoxia and systemic inflammation 
However  patients with underlying cardiovascular disease represent a significant proportion of the patients who may suffer from a severe course after COVID  infection  This situation may be aggravated by findings showing that ACE inhibitors  which are often used to treat cardiovascular diseases  augment the expression of the SARS CoV  receptor ACE  in lung cells  This is probably mediated by an effect on angiotensin II  which is known to reduce ACE  expression  Thus  ACE inhibition decreases angiotensin II  leading to an indirect up regulation of ACE  The effect of angiotensin II receptor blockers  ARBs  which primarily target the angiotensin receptor   is unclear 
One may speculate that ARBs indirectly reduce ACE  levels by augmenting free angiotensin II levels  which in turn is expected to down regulate ACE  via activating the angiotensin receptor  
However  the effect of the two different treatments on the expression of ACE  in the heart requires further investigation Therefore  we used single nuclei RNA sequencing to determine the expression of ACE and ACE  in the different cell types of the human heart 
Gene expression signatures were detected in cardiac tissues of five patients with aortic stenosis  AS  and two patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction  HFrEF   Figure  A  and compared with with samples of one healthy donor heart  age    years  male  that was not used for transplantation 
After single nuclei RNA sequencing  data were pooled  and unsupervised clustering was performed with a total of     nuclei 
We found   distinct clusters 
Using cell type specific gene markers  major cell types were annotated  including cardiomyocytes  six clusters  fibroblasts  one cluster  endothelial cells  three clusters  leucocytes  two clusters  pericytes  one cluster  and smooth muscle cells  one cluster   Figure  B–D 
ACE  was expressed in cardiomyocytes  Cluster   and   and mural cells  particularly pericytes  Cluster   and was detected at a lower expression level in fibroblasts  endothelial cell  and leucocytes  Figure  D 
Comparison of ACE  in a pooled analysis of nuclei of the different groups showed that ACE  was significantly elevated in cardiomyocytes of patients with heart disease compared with healthy controls  Figure  E 
ACE  was also slightly  but not significantly  increased in endothelial cells  and the expression was lower in fibroblasts of patients with heart disease compared with healthy controls  Figure  E 
Immunostaining confirmed an increased expression of ACE  in cardiomyocytes of patients with aortic stenosis  Figure  F 
In addition  ACE was augmented in cardiomyocytes of patients with AS and HFrEF  Figure  G 
Interestingly  cardiomyocytes of patients who were treated with ACE inhibitors showed a significantly higher ACE  expression compared with ARB treated patients  Figure  H 
Moreover  patients treated with ACE inhibitors had an imbalance of ACE to ACE  expression  with a more than four fold higher ACE ACE  ratio compared with healthy control cells  Figure  I In conclusion  these data provide novel insights into the cell type specific expression and regulation of ACE  in the heart 
Patients with varying heart disease aetiology show augmented expression of ACE  levels particularly in cardiomyocytes 
Treatment with ACE inhibitors tends to be associated with increased ACE  mRNA and unfavourable ACE ACE  ratios  which are believed to be a driver of cardiovascular pathologies  This study is limited by its small sample size and therefore is only hypothesis generating 
However  these novel data suggest that it will be important to monitor SARS CoV infected patients for cardiovascular complications and assess the impact of ARB ACE inhibitor therapy 
Conflict of interest  none declared New onset acute symptomatic seizure and risk factors in coronavirus disease   A retrospective multicenter studyIn December   pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus  later called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus    SARS‐CoV‐  was first reported in Wuhan  China 
On March     the World Health Organization  WHO  declared the syndrome caused by SARS‐CoV‐  infection  coronavirus disease    COVID‐  a pandemic 
According to a WHO Situation Report of April    
 
 there are   confirmed COVID‐  cases and   deaths globally 
COVID‐  affects people of all ages 
 
  
 
 and in severe cases  it may cause dyspnea  hypoxia  acute respiratory distress syndrome  and septic shock 
 
  
 

The current situation has raised concerns regarding whether people with epilepsy have a higher risk to be infected with COVID‐  and whether people would develop acute seizures during the course of COVID‐ 
The objective of this study is to clarify the incidence and the risk of acute symptomatic seizures during acute COVID‐  infections This retrospective multicenter study was approved by the ethics committee of West China Hospital  Sichuan University  approval   
The study was conducted in   officially designed hospitals in Hubei province  the epicenter of the COVID‐  epidemic in China  Sichuan province  and Chongqing municipality 
These hospitals included the East Branch of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University  West China Ward  Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital  and hospitals in Sichuan province designated by the government to treat COVID‐   see the list of hospitals in Appendix S People with COVID‐  who were discharged from or died in the participating hospitals between January   and February     were consecutively enrolled 
All cases were diagnosed according to the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for COVID‐   trial version  
 
 All those enrolled tested positive through nucleic acid detection 
Disease severity was classified as mild  moderate  severe  or critical according to the national guidelines  see Box   for classification criteria 
 
 For our study  we aggregated severe and critical cases into a single severe group  whereas mild and moderate cases were aggregated into a single milder group 
The clinical outcome at discharge was either cured or death Electronic medical records of all enrolled cases were reviewed by   neurologists using a standard case report form  Appendix S 
Data were extracted on demographic characteristics  medical history  complications  treatments  and presence of risk factors for seizures 
These risk factors were considered to be the following  acute cerebrovascular disease  traumatic brain injury  TBI  central nervous system  CNS  infection  shock  hypoxia  severe metabolic disturbance  based on criteria from the International League Against Epilepsy
 
  multiple‐organ dysfunction syndrome  sepsis  and exposure to drugs or toxic substances Continuous variables were presented as median  interquartile range  and categorical variables as n  All of   people discharged from or who died at participating hospitals were consecutively identified and enrolled 
Most were from Sichuan province  n     followed by Chongqing  n     and Hubei  n    Ten individuals died  giving case fatality rates of    n     in Hubei     n     in Chongqing  and    n     in Sichuan 
Of the   severe cases      received mechanical ventilation  and     were given sedatives 
Apart from the effect of sedatives  mental state was relatively normal in   people 
Eight were encephalopathic  one was obtunded  one was delirious  and six were comatose 
The diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus was not made in any of these cases based on clinical presentation  results of investigations  or response to therapy 
No routine or long‐term electroencephalogram  EEG  was recorded due to exposure concerns None in this cohort had a past history of epilepsy 
None had any seizures  including febrile seizures  or status epilepticus during hospitalization 
Seizurelike events were seen in two people  it was believed that this was the result of an acute stress reaction in one and hypocalcemia in the other The first was a  ‐year‐old woman who reported bilateral bodily spasms lasting for about   minute  with mouth deviation but no impairment of awareness 
She was evaluated neurologically and psychiatrically and was diagnosed with an acute anxiety disorder  which was treated with olanzapine  paroxetine  and diazepam The second case was a  ‐year‐old woman who displayed bilateral myoclonus in the limbs with no impairment in consciousness   hours after admission 
Although this was initially suspected to represent seizures  she was found to have an electrolyte disturbance including hyponatremia  hypokalemia  and hypocalcemia  and the myoclonus resolved with correction of the metabolic disturbances Eighty‐four   cases reported systemic or direct brain insults that increased their risk for acute symptomatic seizures  Table  
The most common risk factor was hypoxia 
No severe electrolyte disturbance was seen  but hypokalemia  n       hyponatremia  n       and hypocalcemia  n       were frequently seen in the cohort 
Urea  creatinine  and serum glucose levels were moderately altered in most of cases 
In two cases who had chronic kidney dysfunction  substantial increases in creatinine levels were noted 
Results of investigations are shown in Table  
One case with TBI had an epidural hematoma  cerebral contusion  and skull base fracture 
Five people with severe COVID‐  experienced septic shock 
Three other cases of shock had hypovolemia or cardiac problems 
Ninety‐four   were given antibiotics  moxifloxacin  n       piperacillin sulbactam sodium  n       and third‐generation cephalosporins  n       were most commonly used We found no new onset seizures or status epilepticus in a large cohort of people hospitalized during the acute phase of COVID   infection despite a substantial proportion having risk factors for acute symptomatic seizures 
This is useful information  given the prior lack of knowledge about seizure risk during the acute phase of infection No individual in this cohort had a history of epilepsy prior to hospital admission 
To date  there is not much information available on people with epilepsy during the COVID‐  crisis 
There is one report of epilepsy in a case COVID‐  from Wuhan 
 
 As information is limited  it is not possible to establish whether this was a patient who had a history of epilepsy or whether the patient presented acute seizures 
There is at this time little if any evidence indicating that people with epilepsy are at an increased risk of COVID‐  infection 
A major challenge for people with epilepsy in this outbreak is nonadherence with the prescribed antiseizure medication  which was seen during the in SARS endemic in  
 
 This indicates the need to ensure the availability of supplies of medications and to advocate patients  self‐management 
Possible strategies for coping could also include online consultations and telemedicine networks Although many neurological and systemic disorders regarded as potential triggers
 
 of acute symptomatic seizures were identified in this cohort  seizures and status were not seen 
Stroke is one such risk factor 
The risk of developing acute symptomatic seizures after stroke ranges from   to  
 
 Acute cerebrovascular disease is considered a major cause of seizure and status epilepticus 
An earlier study from Hubei
 
  
 
 also reported six people with COVID‐  who had acute cerebrovascular disease without seizure 
Infection of the CNS can also give rise to seizures 
Although there is limited evidence of the presence of the SARS‐CoV‐  in the cerebrospinal fluid  CSF  the co‐occurrence of tubercular meningitis
 
 had been reported  with no seizure or status observed 
To determine whether COVID‐  can cause direct CNS insults requires further follow‐up 
In the earlier outbreaks of another coronavirus  a generalized convulsion with a positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for SARS‐CoV in CSF was reported  which could have been a coincidence 
 

Disturbances of homeostasis may lead to acute symptomatic seizures 
Hypoxia  the most common complication in our cohort  may trigger anoxic encephalopathy  particularly in refractory hypoxia 
Electrolyte disturbances as seen in COVID‐  are considered to be potential causes of acute symptomatic seizure 
 
 The severity and speed of such disturbances may affect onset of seizures  so these parameters should be carefully monitored The cytokine storm syndromes
 
 behind severe infection may cause the production of inflammatory cytokines systemically  with the consequence of acute toxic encephalopathies 
Although sepsis is a common cause of encephalopathy in intensive care medicine 
 
 hypoxia appears far more often than sepsis in COVID‐ 
There was also a high rate of septic shock in the COVID‐  population  varying from  
 
 to   in earlier studies in Hubei 
 
  
 

Certain antibiotics have been associated with symptomatic seizure 
 
 Antibiotics were used in a large number of people in our cohort without problems  but the most used antibiotics in the cohort were of low or moderate risk 
Clinicians should keep this seizure risk in mind when prescribing antibiotics  especially for people with renal dysfunction 
 

Our study has several limitations 
First  as a cross‐sectional study  we only have data from the acute phase of the disease 
A follow‐up study is underway to evaluate longitudinal seizure outcomes 
Second  the retrospective study design meant that we could not collect data on all relevant variables  for example  EEG was not recorded  so subclinical seizures could have been missed 
As all health care costs of COVID‐  treatment are covered by the government  all those suspected of infection are screened 
This may assure the objectivity and reliability of study materials  and it will allow for a future follow‐up study Our analysis suggests that COVID‐  poses minimal risk for seizures during the acute illness  although a significant proportion of severely ill individuals have risk factors that may increase the propensity to experience seizures 
These risk factors should be promptly addressed to minimize the risk of developing seizures 
Prospective long‐term studies must be done to determine whether people who have suffered from COVID‐  have an increased risk for developing seizures or epilepsy in subsequent months or years as a consequence of their illness None of the authors has any conflict of interest to disclose 
We confirm that we have read the Journal s position on issues involved in ethical publication and affirm that this report is consistent with those guidelines Decreased prealbumin level is associated with increased risk of mortality in hospitalized elderly patients with COVID The coronavirus disease    COVID  epidemic is caused by an infection with a novel coronavirus  officially named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus    SARS COV 
The infection spread rapidly on all continents and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization 
As of April       documented cases were reported worldwide  and   patients had died 
As there are currently no specific treatments and medications against the new virus  it is crucial to identify risk factors of severe prognosis Older patients have poorer prognostic factors and are more likely to experience critical disease 
 
 
Based on recent statistical data of China  among patients who were   years and older  the mortality rate was   which was significantly higher than that of younger patients at  
The proportion of deaths over   years old accounts for   of the total deaths in the national wide  which implicates aged people are more vulnerable to the SARS CoV 
Till present there are rare reports in literature focusing on the risk factors for poor outcomes of the elderly patients with COVID Serum prealbumin  known as transthyretin  its levels may be lowered not only by malnutrition  but also by inflammation and aging 
 
 
Compared to albumin  prealbumin has a shorter half life  a more rapid rate of hepatic synthesis  and predictable catabolic rate  hence  it may be a more sensitive indicator 
However  whether prealbumin could be an independent predictor of mortality in hospitalized COVID  elderly patients needs to be further elucidated The present study aims to describe the clinical characteristics and to investigate whether the prealbumin can serve as a valuable predictor of in hospital mortality  which might provide evidence for the risk stratification in elderly and help to improve the clinical practice and reduce fatality We designed this study as a retrospective cohort study design 
The elderly patients with COVID  who were admitted to Tongji Hospital in Wuhan from January   to February     were consecutively included 
This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Tongji Hospital  Approval Number  TJ IRB  and was complied with the Declaration of Helsinki 
The data were anonymous and the study was observational  so the informed consent was not gathered 
A flow diagram illustrating patient selection was described in Figure  
 
Inclusion criteria included elderly patients  ≥   years old  diagnosed with COVID  infection 
A total of   participants have been obtained 
Patients having missing baseline or outcome data  died on admission or being transferred to other designated hospitals during hospitalization were excluded 
There were   patients were included in the final analyses Data collection of participants was performed using hospital electronic medical record system 
Information included medical history  demographic data  physical examination  and hematological  biochemical  radiological and microbiological evaluation results were reviewed 
The data collection forms were reviewed independently by   researchers  CL and LYY 
Blood examinations were assessed at the central laboratory of Tongji Hospital following standard operative procedures 
The routine blood test was analyzed using Sysmex XE  hematology analyzer  Sysmex  Kobe  Japan 
The Cobas C   Roche  Mannheim  Germany  was used to measure the biochemical parameters 
Coagulation tests were detected by STA R MAX coagulation analyzer  Diagnostica Stago  Saint Denis  France 
Throat swab samples were collected and were tested for SARS CoV  with commercial real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  RT PCR  kit from DAAN GENE  Guangzhou  China 
The diagnostic criteria and all clinical procedures in this study followed  Diagnosis and Treatment of Pneumonia Caused by New Coronavirus  Trial version   to   promulgated by the National Health and Health Commission of China Summary statistics of baseline characteristics of all patients and stratification by prealbumin tertiles were expressed as frequency and proportion for categorical variables  mean   standard deviation  SD   Gaussian distribution  or median  range   Skewed distribution  for continuous variables  and as percentages for categorical variables 
The differences between groups were analyzed using the χ   categorical variables  One Way ANOVA test  normal distribution  or Kruskal Whallis H test  skewed distribution We examined the relationship of the prealbumin as categorized into tertiles with the outcomes of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation 
Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to evaluate these relationships  then unadjusted and adjusted odds ratio  ORs  and   confidence intervals  CIs  were calculated 
Model   is the minimally adjusted model with only sociodemographic variables adjusted 
Model   is the fully adjusted model with covariates including age  sex  smoking status  history of hypertension  history of coronary heart disease  history of diabetes  history of chronic kidney disease  history of carcinoma  history of chronic liver disease  neutrophil  lymphocyte  prothrombin time  activated partial thromboplastin time  d dimer  alanine transaminase  aspartate aminotransferase  total bilirubin  blood urea nitrogen  creatinine  C reactive protein and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio 
We calculated odds ratio  ORs  and   confidence intervals  CIs 
The highest tertile was the reference for prealbumin 
We performed test for linear trend by entering the median value of each category of prealbumin tertile as continuous variable to examine the possibility of nonlinearity To ensure the robustness of our results  we also performed stratified analyses with the prealbumin as a continuous variable for the overall population and stratified by gender  age  hypertension status and coronary heart disease status at baseline 
Generalized additive models were used to visually confirm the relationship between prealbumin as continuous variable and the risk of outcomes  all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation Modeling was performed with the statistical software packages R  http www R project org  The R Foundation  and EmpowerStats  http www empowerstats com  X Y Solutions  Inc  Boston  MA 
P values less than    two sided  were considered statistically significant In our study    cases were excluded 
To avoid selection bias due to missing data  we performed a sensitivity analysis 
The results showed that there was no statistical difference between missing group and non missing group  supplemental table  Of   elderly inpatients included in the final analysis  the mean age was     years  ranging from   years to   years  and most patients were male  table  
 
The baseline characteristics of these included participants were listed in table 
The day of sample drawing after admission was       day 
No significant statistical difference in sex  smoking status  body weight  BMI  comorbidity  hypertension  coronary heart disease  chronic kidney disease  cerebral vascular disease  carcinoma  chronic liver disease  symptoms  fever  cough  headache  diarrhea and myalgia fatigue at admission  were detected across different groups of prealbumin  tertile 
When compared with subjects in the highest tertile  those in the lowest tertile were older  more likely to have diabetes medical history  with higher Neutrophil count  lower lymphocyte count  worse coagulation function and liver function 
A total of     patients required mechanical ventilation      patients admitted to intensive care unit and     patients died during hospitalization 
The incidence of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation were significantly decreased across prealbumin tertiles  all cause death    vs    vs    for tertile   vs  tertile   vs  tertile   ICU admission    vs    vs    for tertile   vs  tertile   vs  tertile   mechanical ventilation    vs    vs    for tertile   vs  tertile   vs  tertile   respectively To investigate the correlation between prealbumin and in hospital outcomes  we constructed three models using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models  table  
 
In the unadjusted model  the ORs of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation was significantly increased as the prealbumin tertiles downgraded 
The OR for tertile   was significantly higher than the OR for tertile    OR       CI    to   P   for all cause death  OR       CI    to   P   for ICU admission  OR       CI    to   P   for mechanical ventilation 
Additional adjustment for the demographic variables and comorbidities did not reduce the ORs for the association between prealbumin tertiles and in hospital outcomes 
Further adjusting for the baseline levels of blood examinations  including blood routine  neutrophil  lymphocyte  neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio  coagulation function  prothrombin time  activated partial thromboplastin time  d dimer  liver fuction  alanine transaminase  aspartate aminotransferase  total bilirubin  renal function  blood urea nitrogen  creatinine  and infection indicators  C reactive protein  did not affect the relationships in the fully adjusted models  OR       CI    to   P   for all cause death  OR       CI    to   P   for ICU admission  OR       CI    to   P     for mechanical ventilation 
Therefore  lower tertile of prealbumin exhibited an increased risk of worse in hospital outcomes  full adjusted P for trend for all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation  P     P   and P     respectively Generalized additive models  Fig  
A through  C  were used to visually assess functional relationships between the prealbumin as continuous variate and the risk of in hospital outcomes 
Serum prealbumin was found to have negative linear relationship with the risk of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation To determine the consistency of the relationship between baseline prealbumin as a continuous variable and in hospital outcomes  we conducted stratified analyses  Table  
 
For each unit increase of prealbumin  the adjusted OR for all cause death was   in males  P     and   in females  P    
The adjusted OR for all cause death for persons less than   years of age was    P     compared with    p     for persons   years and older  P interaction    
For each unit increase of the prealbumin  the OR for all cause death was    P     and    P     for normotensives and hypertensives     P     and    P     for non diabetic and diabetes respectively 
The difference of interaction was not significant between two groups  P interaction         and   stratified for gender  age  hypertention and diabetes respectively 
Moreover  the relationship between baseline prealbumin with ICU admission and mechanical ventilation stratified by gender  age  hypertention and diabetes are consistent In this study  we found that lower serum prealbumin significantly associated with an increased risk of worse outcomes and all cause death during hospitalization 
Patients in the lowest tertile of prealbumin were older  and with higher Neutrophil count  lower lymphocyte count  worse coagulation function and liver function compared with subjects in the highest tertile 
Then we adjusted relevant covariates including age  sex  smoking status  comorbidities  neutrophil  lymphocyte  coagulation function  liver function  renal function and C reactive protein to minimize the potential impact of confounding 
Compared with crude regression analyses  this association still persisted when adjusting for demographic and clinical variables in the multivariable regression analyses 
Moreover  stratified by gender  age  hypertension and diabetes  increased level of serum prealbumin was associated with the decreased risk of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation  which determine the consistency of the relationship between lowest serum prealbumin tertile and the increased risk of worse outcomes in elderly COVID  patients Several previous studies have demonstrated baseline prealbumin change in COVID  patients 
Decreased level of prealbumin was observed among COVID  patients 
Wu C et al investigated   patients with COVID  and observed that prealbumin was associated with the development of ARDS  indicating the potential value of prealbumin level on COVID  clinical ending 
Till date  no report exists on the effect of prealbumin in COVID  elderly patients High proportion of severe to critical cases and high fatality rate were observed in the elderlyCOVID  patients  and rapid disease progress was noted in the dead 
One possible explanation involves the greater potential of seniors to be in a state of inflammation  nutritional deficiency and other complications 
Prealbumin is a globular  non glycosilated protein  synthesized by the liver  and complexed with a retinol binding protein  which acts as a transporter of retinol vitamin A and thyroid hormones 
Low plasma prealbumin level has far back emerged as an earliest laboratory indicator of poor nutritional status 
 
 
In addition  prealbumin are also associated with inflammation 
Previous studies showed that in response to the inflammation  the body responds by synthesizing a large number of cytokines 
These include interleukins and tumor necrosis factors that down regulate  decrease  plasma concentrations of albumin and prealbumin 
 
 
Therefore  assay of serum prealbumin concentration is recommended by some investigators as a screening marker for both malnutrition and inflammation Elderly with low plasma prealbumin levels mean that those people are at greater risk of malnutrition and inflammatory conditions  which may lead to poor prognosis 
Malnutrition is commonly seen in hospitalized patients in both the developed and developing world  especially among elderly patients 
A review of   published studies of acute care patients reported that malnutrition incidence ranged from  –  of hospitalized elderly 
It was found that compared to non famine regions of India  experiencing famine had significantly higher influenza mortality rates during the   Influenza pandemic 
Aging  frailty  and chronic diseases are associated with impaired immune function and are compounded by immune dysregulation from malnutrition 
When immune response is dysregulated  it would result in an excessive inflammation  even death 
In the current COVID  study  it was found that elderly patients have higher levels of white blood cells counts  CRP  inflammatory cytokines and are more likely to experience critical disease than did those younger patients 
 
 This retrospective cohort study included   elderly COVID  patients  until the date of February       of patients required mechanical ventilation    of patients admitted to intensive care unit  and the total in hospital mortality was  
The mortality rate was lower than that reported by wang L et al  among elderly COVID  patients 
This may have been the reason for some patients at the date of February     are still in hospital 
Nevertheless  this would not bias the relationship between prealbumin and in hospital outcomes because of the definite observation time we set previously 
Moreover  Wuhan tongji Hospital as one of the largest third grade Class A hospitals equipped with advanced life support training and equipment may partly account for the moderate mortality The results of this study have several clinical implications and strengths 
A low prealbumin concentration can therefore be regarded primarily as a signal identifying the at risk elderly patient who would suffer worse outcomes and requires careful assessment and monitoring for whom nutritional support and Inflammation detection may be needed as part of the treatment plan 
As observational study was susceptible to various confounders  we adjusted many variables that may affect the relationship between prealbumin and in hospital outcomes to minimize potential confounding 
In addition  we tested the robustness of the results by repeating the analyses in different subgroups of gender  age  history of hypertension and history of diabetes Our study has some limitations 
First  by including patients still in hospital as of J February     the case fatality ratio in our study cannot reflect the true mortality of elderly COVID 
Second  the record of data may be affected by prehospital medication and the time interval between admission and onset 
Third  since all subjects in our study were hospitalized Chinese elderly patients diagnosed with COVID  results of this study might not directly be applied to other ethnicities and age groups In conclusion  this retrospective cohort study revealed that the prealbumin is an independent risk factor for the in hospital mortality in the Chinese COVID  elderly patients 
Nutritional support and Inflammation detection should be careful assessment and monitoring for the elderly patients with low prealbumin concentration

Coping With COVID  Emergency Stress  Secondary Trauma and Self Efficacy in Healthcare and Emergency Workers in ItalyThe coronavirus disease  COVID  or the acute respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus    SARS CoV  began spreading in China at the end of   and  to date  represents an international health emergency without precedents in terms of its health  economic  and organizational effects on people s lives  World Health Organization   
After China  Italy was the first country to be affected by this epidemic  with the first deaths on February     and a rapid increase in the spread of infection and mortality 
COVID  was first detected in Northern Italy  and it then spread  although at different rates of incidence  to the other regions 
It was immediately evident that healthcare and emergency workers were at great risk of contagion and that protection and intervention protocols needed to be introduced in the absence of adequate points of reference because of the exceptional nature of the epidemic  the rate of spread of the infection  the seriousness of patients  health condition  and the mortality index 
The extreme conditions in which health workers have had to work  especially in the most affected regions in Northern Italy  are indicated by the following data from the Italian National Institute of Health   over   doctors died and   other health workers were infected within the general context of the population of   deaths and   infections in a span of   weeks 
It was also clear that the medical staff would experience serious psychological repercussions because of the working conditions as well as the difficulty of having scientific points of reference on care and intervention procedures 
To this must be added the increase in workload  the extension of working hours and  for health workers  the frequent exposure to the suffering and death of their patients 
Therefore  healthcare and emergency workers were subjected to serious psychological as well as physical stress 
Hence  the aim of this study  which was also the aim of a previous study  Vagni et al    is to focus on the similarities and the differences in the stress management of two professional groups healthcare and emergency workers during the acute phase of the pandemic 
Both groups have had to deal with COVID patients as frontline responders and have been exposed to the related risks of infection and psychological consequences  which  to date  have not been examined in detail through a comparative analysis As regards the stress that they experience  the literature clearly explains that healthcare and emergency workers who intervene in emergency situations are exposed to the risk of developing dysfunctional reactions that can be identified at different levels physical and or physiological  e g  psychosomatic disorders  sleep wake cycle alterations  and sense of tiredness  emotional  e g  irritability  nervousness  agitation  anger  low self esteem  and guilt  cognitive  e g  distractibility  sense of ineffectiveness  and negative anticipation of events  and relational  e g  increase in conflicts within emergency teams and or with their organization institution  and social withdrawal and may also develop reactions from secondary trauma  Del Missier et al    Sbattella    Argentero and Setti    Fraccaroli and Balducci    Bellelli and Di Schiena    Walton et al   
Faced with stressful events regarding which they lack previous experience and specific  necessary knowledge  and which cause tension owing to the need for rapid decision timings and a sense of responsibility  emergency workers may experience a sense of decision ineffectiveness 
In fact  emergency situations are characterized by high levels of decisional and operational uncertainty with associated regret and guilt  Del Missier et al   Several studies have highlighted that insufficient instructions and a lack of personal protective equipment  PPE  are important predictors of stress for healthcare and emergency workers in large scale emergencies  Oh et al    Du et al    El Hage et al    Walton et al

  highlighted that nurses involved in managing the Middle East respiratory syndrome  MERS  experienced lower levels of stress when the levels of goods supply and hospital training were higher 
Some studies have highlighted that frontline healthcare workers had lower secondary traumatization scores than non frontline health workers and the general public in contrast to the findings of previous research on the SARS outbreak in the same area in Singapore  Chan and Huak   
According to Barleycorn   and Tan et al 
  these results may be due to the dedicated training and psychological support given to healthcare workers after the SARS outbreak and demonstrate the validity of policy strategies for prevention of stress in the psychological health field An analysis of   studies published from January to March   aimed at investigating the stress experience of healthcare workers in facing COVID  shows that health workers experienced symptoms of depression and anxiety related to this stressful experience 
Moreover  the severity of their symptoms was influenced by their age  gender  role  specialization  type of activity performed  and exposure to patients with COVID  however  prevention  resilience  and social support interventions mediated their response to stress  Bohlken et al   
In a review of the literature  Spoorthy   underlined that sociodemographic variables  such as age  gender  profession  and workplace  and psychological variables  such as poor social support and self efficacy  affect the stress level experienced by health workers 
In addition  COVID  emerged as an independent stress risk factor 
Xiao et al 
  found that social support plays a role in reducing the anxiety levels in medical staff and increases their sense of self efficacy According to Walton et al 
  the specific stressors that health workers face in the COVID  emergency are related to the organizational context 
The challenges for medical staff include not only an increased workload but also a fear of infection  the need to work with new protocols that change frequently  and the use of PPE 
In uncontrollable situations such as a pandemic  when specific action protocols are absent and limited resources are available  health workers must make individual decisions with a heavy burden of responsibility that may be contrary to their moral principles 
For example  in the case of COVID  they may have to choose which patients to save because only a few places are available in intensive care 
In this regard  Cai et al 
  showed that for a sample of   healthcare professionals who worked closely with COVID  patients in Hubei  the most stressful factors were the lack of protocols for the treatment of COVID  the scarcity of PPE  the exhausting work shifts  their concern about the risk of infection  and their exposure to the death and suffering of their patients 
They also found that the support of superiors proved to be one of the most important motivational factors for medical staff  and the presence of clear guidelines and effective safety protocols were protective factors against the development of stress  in particular  for females 
Further  Walton et al 
  identified the organizational stressors as the changes in work shifts  the prevalence of night shifts  an excessive workload  staff roles  autonomy  the lack of support from superiors  and the absence of adequate information and clear instructions 
On the basis of these stressors  they estimated that   of the medical staff working on the front line of this pandemic are at risk of developing post traumatic stress disorder  PTSD 
In addition  limited resources  longer shifts  decreased hours of rest  and the occupational risks associated with COVID  exposure have increased the physical and mental fatigue  stress  anxiety  and burnout of these staff members  Sasangohar et al   The loss of a social support network  which can be an important resilience factor  is another risk factor  Ozbay et al   
In the COVID  emergency  healthcare and emergency workers have often experienced a separation from their affective links  either because of the restrictions on social contacts imposed by the lockdown or the fear of spreading the infection to their family members 
To this must be added that although  at first  health workers received unanimous encouragement from the population  later  they also experienced demonstrations of stigma and isolation 
Some studies have shown that being able to resort to their own social support network is a significant protective factor for health workers dealing with this emergency  Cai et al   As Favretto   stated  when individuals experience situations that go beyond their coping strategies  their vulnerability to  and risk of developing  psychopathological reactions increases 
Studies conducted during previous epidemics  such as the SARS  MERS  and Ebola epidemics  converge in detecting how healthcare and emergency workers may experience extremely high levels of stress and even develop secondary traumatic stress or vicarious trauma 
This trauma is defined as an experience of symptoms similar to those found in people with PTSD  such as in emergency nurses working with traumatized patients  Beck   
Figley   defined it as a form of stress that derives from the feelings of empathy experienced when helping traumatized people 
The symptoms may include intrusive recurring thoughts  disturbed sleep  fatigue  physical symptoms  hyperarousal  increased stress response  anxiety  depression  and feeling emotional  Adriaenssens et al   
Wolf et al 
  described how nurses may feel  overwhelmed  and this condition becomes a source of moral distress that triggers feelings of powerlessness  guilt  fear  anger  and frustration The sense of frustration and impotence felt by nurses when they are unable to treat and save a patient has been highlighted as a risk factor for secondary traumatic stress in several studies  Missouridou   
Avoidance and emotional numbing can become tools for self protection from intrusive symptoms that exceed the personal tolerance level  Coetzee and Klopper    Mealer and Jones   
Their frustration obviously intensifies on a patient s death 
The onset of PTSD in the health workers involved in treating MERS was also detected after the acute phase of the emergency was over  highlighting a risk not only in the immediate period but also in the medium term period  Lee et al   In reference to COVID  updated studies conducted on Chinese health workers have already highlighted the strong impact of the epidemic on the psychological health of doctors and nurses 
Some studies have found that healthcare workers have high levels of anxiety  depression  insomnia  and distress  Lai et al    Li et al    Zhu et al   
In particular  female professionals with more than   years of experience and previous psychiatric pathology present more risk factors of developing the symptoms of stress  anxiety  and depression  Lai et al    Zhu et al   
Huang J 
Z  et al 
  studied stress levels during the COVID  emergency in a sample of medical staff 
They found that females showed higher levels of anxiety and PTSD than males did and that the levels were higher for nurses than for doctors 
Moreover  Li et al 
  found that nurses had developed higher levels of vicarious trauma than those of the general population and that nurses who did not work closely with COVID  patients showed a more severe symptomatology  both physical and psychological  compared with their colleagues working on the frontline emergency services 
In Italy  a study conducted on healthcare workers found that doctors and nurses developed high levels of stress and anxiety  greater than those developed by the general population  and that healthcare workers operating in the North  the area of Italy most affected by the virus  showed a more severe symptomatology  Simione and Gnagnarella   
This study also confirmed that females tend to have a greater perception of the risk of infection  which increases their risk of developing the symptoms of anxiety and distress Because of their long  intense exposure to various stressors  it is important to note the nature of the coping strategies used by these healthcare and emergency workers in these situations and their effectiveness in terms of reducing and effectively coping with stress 
Indeed  the effective management of stress levels in the acute emergency phase could reduce the risk of developing long term PTSD or other pathologies  such as anxiety and depression  Fullerton et al    Slottje et al    Argentero and Setti    Sakuma et al    Birinci and Erden    Li et al   
Coping may be defined as a series of cognitive and behavioral efforts to manage specific internal or external issues that test or exceed individual resources  Lazarus and Folkman   
A distinction can be made between problem focused and emotion focused coping strategies 
The former is aimed at modifying and solving the stressful situation through active interventions 
By contrast  emotion focused coping is aimed at managing the emotions connected to the stressful event and regulating affective reactions  such as anxiety and the tension of response to stress  for example  by trying to avoid the threat  denial  or re evaluating it  reappraisal The choice of coping strategies is influenced by the individual s cognitive evaluation of the event  termed secondary evaluation  which involves estimating the resources available and the most effective strategies to deal with the situation  Lazarus and Folkman   
A key element of this assessment is the extent to which the individual can maintain control over the outcome of the situation 
The literature indicates that individuals apply dysfunctional coping when they face an uncontrollable event by responding primarily with a coping strategy focused on the problem  and conversely  when they face a controllable situation  they respond with coping strategies focused on emotions  Strentz and Auerbach    Vitaliano et al   
A coping strategy may be defined as adaptive when the controllability of the stressful event corresponds with the choice of coping strategy  in this case  the subject will experience fewer symptoms related to stress  Park et al   The strategies used to cope with trauma may differ among individuals  but they can also vary according to the profession and the features of the traumatic event  Nydegger et al   
Individuals differ in their choice of coping strategies  Connor Smith and Flachsbart    and factors related to the situation can also have a decisive influence on such choice  Brown et al   
A few studies have considered the ways in which gender influences the perception of stress in emergency situations and the choice of coping strategy 
These studies highlight that females tend to perceive events as more negative and uncontrollable and to resort more to coping strategies focused on emotions and avoidance  whereas males tend to resort more to applying problem focused coping and to inhibiting emotions  Matud    Matud et al    Matud and Garcia   The literature on the relationship between coping strategies and the stress levels of emergency workers has shown that the use of coping strategies focused on the problem usually tends to correlate with lower stress levels  both in healthcare workers  Watson et al    Howlett et al    and in other emergency workers  such as firefighters  Brown et al   
However  a coping strategy frequently used by emergency workers is that of avoidance and minimization  and this strategy is associated with higher levels of stress  Brown et al    Chang et al    Kerai et al    Witt et al    Theleritis et al   
Loo et al 
  found that in a group of emergency workers  avoidance as well as coping strategies focused on emotions were associated with the development of post traumatic symptomatology 
Rodríguez Rey et al 
  revealed that among health workers working in a pediatric emergency department  approximately   of the variance in PTSD was explained by the frequent use of coping strategies focused on emotions and the infrequent use of those focused on the problem 
In addition  Kucmin et al 
  who considered a sample of   paramedics  highlighted that the risk of developing PTSD symptoms was predicted by the use of coping strategies focused on emotions However  the literature does not offer unanimous results 
Chamberlin and Green   found that in a group of firefighters  all coping strategies actually correlated with high levels of stress  the authors explained this finding by suggesting that it is not the individual coping strategies that are maladaptive in themselves  but that greater effort is needed to adjust in stressful situations 
By contrast  Young et al 
  indicated that firefighters use problem focused coping strategies more often at the beginning of the operation and emotion focused coping strategies more commonly in the phase of breakdown and fatigue 
However  after the incident  they use both strategies  Young et al   
A meta analysis by Shin et al 
  highlighted that different coping strategies have different effects on work burnout  in particular  emotional stress and depersonalization are associated with the use of emotion focused coping strategies  whereas professional ineffectiveness is associated with the use of problem focused strategies Further  a few studies have investigated the coping strategies that emergency workers can use during health emergencies similar to COVID 
Maunder et al 
  revealed that healthcare professionals who tended to apply dysfunctional coping strategies  based on avoidance  hostile comparison  or self blame  tended to develop higher stress levels 
Wong et al 
  highlighted that during the SARS epidemic  doctors and nurses tended to use different coping strategies 
The doctors tended to turn more to action planning  but this strategy did not affect their stress level 
Instead  their stress level was positively correlated with their use of coping strategies based on emotional outlets 
By contrast  the nursing staff tended to resort more to behavioral disengagement and distraction strategies  which  however  correlated with higher levels of stress among them In this regard  during the MERS epidemic  hospital staff tended to adopt coping strategies related to the use of PPE and the adoption of all prevention measures  as well as social support  whereas the coping strategy that they adopted the least was that based on an emotional outlet  Khalid et al   
A recent study on healthcare workers in Hubei  China  during the COVID  epidemic  Cai et al    yielded similar results  to reduce stress  the medical staff tended to rely on active coping strategies  such as using security protocols  practicing social isolation measures  and seeking support from family and friends  but they did not find it necessary to discuss their emotions with a professional 
Huang L  et al 
  found that a sample of nurses working during the COVID  emergency presented greater emotional reactions and turned more to problem focused coping compared with university nursing students 
Emergency workers must have sufficient self efficacy in terms of their coping skills to be able to manage and cope with stress levels 
Self efficacy in coping appears to be an effective protective factor in relation to stress levels and maladaptive responses  Chesney et al   
Self efficacy to cope with traumatic events has been effective in reducing the risk of developing PTSD  Bosmans et al   The main objective of this study is to identify the coping strategies activated by healthcare and emergency workers to deal with stress factors related to the COVID  emergency that may be associated with the risk of developing vicarious or secondary trauma 
Few studies have considered both groups simultaneously when analyzing the strategies they have adopted to manage stress during the COVID  emergency 
Hence  in this study  we are interested in detecting the similarities and differences in the approaches they adopted to manage their stress during the acute phase of the current pandemic According to Walton et al 
  the main acute stress reactions of emergency workers to emergency medical situations are emotional  cognitive  physical  and social reactions 
Therefore  these factors were included in the questionnaire used in the present study 
Moreover  reactions linked to stress factors for difficulties due to ineffective decision making and dealing with stress were also considered  Chesney et al   
In addition  fears regarding contracting the virus and infecting their own families because of COVID  were specifically considered  Du et al    Huang J 
Z  et al    Ornell et al    Walton et al   Based on results found in the literature  the specific objectives of this study are as follows Participants were selected on a voluntary basis through a trasversal sampling in order to take a picture of the situation caused by the pandemic emergency 
We used an internet platform to conduct the study and approached the participants using social media  dedicated mailing lists  and forums 
Participants from all Italian regions completed the questionnaire online 
The sample consists of   participants  males   and   females  whose average age was   years  SD     min   – max  
Further    of the sample were married    were separated  and the remaining   were single 
We selected various professional figures who had directly worked in various sectors during the COVID  emergency and who could be divided into two main groups 
The first  the  Health Group  consists of   participants   who were healthcare workers    doctors     nurses     psychologists   and seven healthcare assistants  
Their average age was   years  SD     and their average years of active professional service was    SD    
The second  the  Emergency Group  consists of   participants     emergency workers     firefighters   and   Civil Protection staff   whose average age was   years  SD     and average years of service was    SD    
There was an age difference between the two groups  t     p   and the distribution of the gender variable differed between the two groups  with   males and   females in the Health Group and   males and   females in the Emergency Group  χ    p    
The study involved participants from the entire national territory  and their workplace could be divided as follows      and   were from North  Central  and South Italy  respectively 
Further    of the sample worked directly with COVID  patients and   worked in specific COVID  departments 
Among the healthcare workers    had worked in direct contact with COVID  patients  whereas among the emergency workers  only   had assisted these patients  χ    p    
In the present study  we included two variables  lack of necessary instructions and lack of PPE  in accordance with the findings in the literature on their impact on the stress reactions of healthcare and emergency workers during the COVID  pandemic 
Among the participants    and   of healthcare and emergency workers  respectively  did not have sufficient instructions to intervene  χ    p n s 
  and   and   of healthcare and emergency workers  respectively  lacked adequate PPE when working  χ    p n s 
 This study used an online questionnaire and was conducted during the lockdown period owing to the COVID  pandemic 
The questionnaire had three parts  one each to collect online informed consent and baseline sociodemographic information  and one with an online series of questionnaires  as described in the next section 
Participants  anonymity was maintained in collecting the data 
The institutional Ethics Committee approved all the procedures This instrument s   items enable verification of the presence of two symptoms of vicarious trauma  Intrusion and Arousal  and their relative frequency 
The STSS was built on the basis of the conceptualization expressed in the DSM   American Psychiatric Association    regarding the characteristic PTSD symptoms 
In detail  the Arousal items describe situations characterized by anxiety  confusion  physical and psychological complaints  and agitation 
Intrusion refers to the re experiencing of the traumatic event even if not directly suffered through internal images and memories 
Instructions for the STSS I indicated that respondents should specify how frequently an item was true for them in the previous   weeks 
The statements are evaluated on a  point scale     never      very often  that provides scores for Intrusion  example items   I thought about my work with victims when I didn t intend to   Reminders of my work with clients upset me  and Arousal  example items   I had trouble concentrating   I was easily annoyed   I expected something bad to happen   I felt jumpy 
The reliability coefficients of the instrument are   and   for Arousal and Intrusion  respectively This is a  item measure of perceived self efficacy for coping with challenges and threats 
This measure focuses on the changes in individuals  confidence in their ability to cope effectively  based on the self efficacy theory  Bandura    Chesney et al   
Participants were asked   When things aren t going well for you  or when you re having problems  how confident or certain are you that you can do the following  Then  they were asked to rate on an  point scale the extent to which they believed they could perform important behaviors for adaptive coping 
The instrument yields three subscale scores   problem focused coping   α      stop unpleasant emotions and thoughts   α     and  support   α    
Anchor points on the scale are    cannot do at all     moderately certain can do  and    certain can do We constructed an ad hoc  item questionnaire that included Yes No questions to detect stress factors identified by the literature  such as the availability of suitable equipment and the receipt of clear instructions during the COVID  coping experience 
In this study  we present the results related to two of these items   Instructions  which refers to having received the necessary instructions to intervene  and  Equipment  which refers to having PPE 
Predictions of these factors have also been made in other studies  Du et al    Walton et al   
In light of the relevance and specificity of the lack of clear information or instructions and adequate PPE in the management of COVID  in the Italian context  as well as the findings in other studies  we decided to focus attention on these two risk factors Our analysis of the literature revealed that in situations in which they have to cope with a pandemic  several factors may affect the stress of medical staff and emergency healthcare workers and that COVID  represents an independent specific stressor  Spoorthy   
These stress factors have been identified as frequently affecting healthcare and emergency workers in emergency situations and leading to physical  emotional  cognitive  decision making  relational  and organizational stress  Del Missier et al    Sbattella    Argentero and Setti    Fraccaroli and Balducci    Bellelli and Di Schiena    Du et al    Walton et al   
Focusing on the specificity of the COVID  epidemic  items have been constructed regarding the fears of contracting the infection and of infecting colleagues or family members  Walton et al    since COVID  represents a factor of independent stress  Spoorthy    that has great impact  Huang J 
Z  et al   
Consequently  we constructed the ESQ consisting of   items assessed on a  point Likert scale  with scores ranging from    not at all  to    very much  grouped into six scales 
The participants were asked to indicate how often they experienced certain emotions and thoughts while performing intervention and emergency activities during the COVID  pandemic The scales correspond to the factors identified and confirmed by factorial analysis through an analysis of the main components with orthogonal rotation of factors  varimax 
The number of factors to be extracted was initially verified through the unit s largest eigenvalue criterion and  subsequently  by the scree test 
The ESQ is based on six scales The ESQ demonstrated good internal consistency  α     overall and for each individual scale  Organizational–Relational Stress  α     Physical Stress  α     Inefficacy Decisional Stress  α     Emotional Stress  α     Cognitive stress  α     and COVID  Stress  α    First  we performed Pearson s correlation analyses to identify the associations between the variables for the two groups that we considered in this study 
Subsequently  we checked for significant differences between the two groups as their stress levels  coping strategies  and secondary trauma 
We used hierarchical linear regression models to verify the predictive effect of the risk factors  lack of adequate information and PPE  on the different stress levels  in step  
Then  we verified the protective effect of the coping strategies  in step  
The models were controlled for age  gender  and group 
Lastly  we used hierarchical regression models to verify the predictive effect of stress factors on the components of secondary trauma 
The models were controlled for age  gender  and group First  we conducted correlational analyses and comparisons of averages on the reference sample 
Table   shows the correlations between the scales of the ESQ and the other instruments Preliminary comparisons were made through the Student s t test between the Health Group and the Emergency Group in relation to the ESQ  CSES SF  and STSS I scores 
Table   shows the comparison between the two groups As shown in Table   significant differences emerged between the two groups in relation to their Stress and Arousal levels 
The results indicate higher levels of both for the Health Group  and that emergency workers turn more to the Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts strategy 
Further  we performed comparisons with reference to the gender variable to detect differences in the levels of stress factors  coping strategies  and secondary trauma 
Females reported significantly higher Physical Stress than males did  Females  M     SD     Males  M     SD     t     p     as well as Emotional Stress  Females  M     SD     Males  M     SD     t     p     and COVID  Stress  Females  M     SD     Males  M     SD     t     p    
No gender difference emerged in coping strategies and secondary trauma 
Within the Health Group  there were significant differences regarding Inefficacy Decisional Stress  F     p     Doctor M     SD     Psychologist M     SD     average difference     p     and COVID  Stress  F     p     Nurse M     SD     Doctor M     SD     difference     p    
Within the Emergency Group  there were no differences in levels of stress and secondary trauma or coping strategies 
Moreover  we found similar correlations between the two groups for the Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts strategy and the stress factors  whereas for the other two coping strategies  we found a different association  particularly for the Emergency Group 
However  the t test comparisons highlight differences only at the level of the Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts strategy 
Given the findings of the preliminary analyses  we considered it necessary to include the age  gender  and group variables to test the predictiveness of the coping strategies on the participants  stress levels To test the predictive effect of the coping strategies on various levels of stress  hierarchical regression was conducted 
Considering the Age and Gender differences within the groups  we included these variables in all models together with the Group variable  Health vs 
Emergency  and the  Instructions  and  Equipment  variables 
The models generated by assuming the ESQ scales as dependent variables are shown in Table  
Regarding the coping strategies  we observed an important effect of the Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts Coping strategy on all the stress scales  except for Physical Stress where the effect of the Focused Problem Coping strategy is recorded As shown in Table   significant negative associations between stressors and secondary trauma were found for both groups 
The hierarchical regression models of stress scales were analyzed for the Arousal and Intrusion levels of secondary trauma 
The models included the Age  Gender  Health Emergency Group variables  and the ESQ scales 
The results are shown in Table  The same regression models were generated by including coping strategies as predictors and were analyzed by Age  Gender  and Health Emergency Group 
Compared with Arousal  the Health Emergency Group and Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts are predictive  R    F     p     Beta  ∗∗∗  Beta  ∗  respectively 
Compared with Intrusion  only the Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts variable  R    F     p     Beta  ∗  assumes significance This study has several limitations 
The first is the limited sample size 
The second is that our study involved participants in the very midst of the COVID  emergency  which means that the level of stress in healthcare workers may have been more severe and acute 
Moreover  the long term psychological implications for the healthcare and emergency population should be investigated for the presence of a full secondary trauma 
Therefore  a large sized longitudinal study is called for to further explore the pathogenesis of vicarious traumatization 
The third is that participants were not selected based on whether they had existing psychological problems 
In proposing the hypothesis of this study  we anticipated that we would be able to discover the relationships between coping strategies  emergency related stress  and secondary trauma in healthcare and emergency workers and commenced our investigation by assuming that the impact of stress can provoke psychological consequences in emergency situations 
In future work  this assumption could be tested to verify whether an emergency situation has a different impact on workers who have already experienced psychological problems The raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors  without undue reservation  to any qualified researcher The studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by Comitato Etico per la Sperimentazione Umana – CESU of the University of Urbino

As reported by some  the association of acute kidney injury  AKI  and COVID  has a high mortality   
However  the incidence of reported AKI associated with COVID  varies widely             
It would be expected that kidney involvement is frequent since the virus enters the cell through the angiotensin converting enzyme    ACE  which is expressed  in addition to pulmonary type   alveolar cells  on renal proximal tubular cells  glomerular visceral and parietal epithelium  and the cytoplasm of the distal tubules and collecting ducts         
In addition  COVID  induces hemodynamic instability and severe inflammation  which  in addition to direct renal infection  can induce acute tubular necrosis  ATN 
We report our experience with AKI in COVID  patients in an inner city  predominantly minority  and a low socioeconomic group and compare our experience with other studies in significantly different cohorts of patients 
We identify the incidence  risk factors  and prognosis of AKI and thus provide a broader understanding of this complication in a group of patients not specifically reported upon to date All adult patients   years of age admitted to the Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center with COVID  infection from March   through April     were studied in this retrospective analysis done in a single medical center serving a low income minority population in Brooklyn  NY 
It was one of the single centers with the most admissions of COVID  patients 
COVID  infection was diagnosed based on clinical presentation  radiographic lung abnormalities  and a positive result of real time PCR 
We excluded COVID  patients from our study if they were on maintenance hemodialysis or were renal transplant recipients 
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Brookdale Hospital and did not require patient consent because of its retrospective design We collected the demographics  the presenting clinical symptoms when available  prior medical history including outpatient medications and prior level of renal function  comorbidities  and in hospital laboratory data from the electronic medical record  Epic Hyperspace   
Laboratory data consisted of complete blood count  hemostasis parameters  renal and liver function  PF ratio  arterial oxygen partial pressure  PaO  fractional inspired oxygen  FiO   creatinine kinase  lactate dehydrogenase  and inflammatory markers including high sensitivity C reactive protein  hs CRP  ferritin  and D dimer 
Normal range of these measures was provided by our laboratory The Kidney Disease  Improving Global Outcome  KDIGO    definition was used to identify AKI 
Estimated glomerular filtration rate  eGFR  on admission was taken as baseline eGFR and was divided into   and ≥  mL min  m 
eGFR was estimated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study  MDRD  equation 
The earliest day of the serum creatinine change that met the KDIGO criteria for AKI was selected as day   of AKI 
The peak serum creatinine value was used to determine the stage of AKI  with an increase in the serum creatinine of  –   –  and   times the baseline serum creatinine defined as AKI stages     and   respectively Continuous variables were described as mean   standard deviation for normally distributed data  or median and interquartile range  IQR  values for non normal distribution 
Categorical variables were presented as frequency and percentage 
The mean of continuous variables was compared by using independent t tests  the Wilcoxon rank sum test  and the Kruskal Wallis test  across the stages of AKI 
The proportion of categorical variables was compared by using χ  test 
Fischer s exact test was used when there were only limited data available 
The Kaplan Meier method  log rank test  was used to determine the cumulative incidence of in hospital mortality 
We used the Cox proportional hazard  PH  regression to determine the association of kidney disease indicators and in hospital mortality 
The assumptions of the Cox PH model were checked using the Schoenfeld residuals  and no violations of the assumptions were present 
In the multivariable analysis  separate Cox PH models were used to determine the association of baseline eGFR and blood urea nitrogen  BUN  on admission  proteinuria  hematuria  and stages of AKI with in hospital mortality since these variables showed a highly significant correlation 
Variables for Cox PH regression were selected using stepwise regression 
Variables with α level of risk factor   were entered into the model 
While evaluating the association of hematuria and proteinuria with in hospital mortality by the Cox PH model  patients with missing values  n     were excluded from the analysis 
All statistical analyses were performed using the STATA version   software and a p value of   was used to determine statistical significance In this study    adult confirmed cases of COVID  were initially reviewed 
Patients on maintenance hemodialysis  n     were excluded from the study and   patients were used for the analysis 
Baseline characteristics of these patients are shown in Table  
  of our cohort were African Americans and   were Hispanics 
The median age of the patients was   years  IQR  –  and   of them were male 
Most of these patients presented with dyspnea   cough   and fever  
  of the patients had a systolic blood pressure below   mm Hg at presentation 
   n     of all patients were mechanically ventilated during the hospitalization 
The median values of ferritin  D dimer  hs CRP  creatinine kinase and lactose dehydrogenase were elevated above their reference ranges  see online suppl

   n     of all the patients studied were discharged     n     were transferred to the other institution  and    n     died during hospitalization On admission  eGFR was   mL min  m  in    n     of the patients 
  and   of the patients  in which these data were available   of the cohort  had proteinuria and hematuria  respectively 
Patients with an eGFR   mL min  m  at presentation were significantly older  median age   vs    years  p     more likely to be males   vs    and have hypertension  HTN  diabetes  hyperlipidemia  and coronary artery disease among other preexisting comorbidities  Table

The development of AKI was seen earlier in the course in patients with an eGFR   mL min  m  at presentation   vs    and occurred within   h of admission 
Patients who developed AKI during the hospitalization were more likely to have a systolic blood pressure of   mm Hg at presentation and a lesser PF ratio and were more likely to be intubated during the course of hospitalization  Table  
Eighteen out of   patients with documented chronic kidney disease  CKD  prior to admission developed AKI during the hospitalization 
Baseline laboratory values of these patients who developed AKI during hospitalization and those who did not are presented in online suppl 
Table  The number of patients requiring renal replacement therapy  RRT  during the hospitalization was  
This represented   of all patients and   of those with AKI 
All the patients who required RRT by definition had stage   AKI 
The modalities of RRT were continuous RRT in   patients   of all those who required RRT  and intermittent hemodialysis in   patients  
Two patients   required both modalities of RRT 
    out of   of those patients who required mechanical ventilation developed AKI compared with     out of   of nonventilated patients 
Of these   patients      required RRT 
The majority of AKI stage   patients requiring RRT were on mechanical ventilation   out of   requiring RRT 
  of the patients who were treated with RRT   out of   patients  died during the hospitalization 
Of those with stage   AKI who were not dialyzed    died 
Renal function recovered sufficiently in   patients treated with RRT and both no longer required dialysis upon discharge Urine studies were available for   of all patients  n     and in     out of   of those patients who developed AKI 
Hematuria of   to   was found by urine dipstick in   of AKI patients  while proteinuria of   to   was detected in   of the patients with AKI Overall  the in hospital mortality was   in COVID  patients 
The in hospital mortality was significantly higher in patients with an eGFR   mL min  m    than in patients with an eGFR ≥  mL min  m    at presentation 
The in hospital mortality of AKI patients was     out of   who developed AKI died   Table  A significantly higher in hospital mortality was observed in patients with an eGFR   mL min  m  at presentation  elevated BUN at presentation  and in hospital AKI using the Kaplan Meier analysis  Fig

In a multivariable Cox PH model  adjusted for age  gender  PF ratio  hemodynamic status  and comorbidities  diabetes  HTN  hyperlipidemia  cancer  and stroke  eGFR   mL min  m  at presentation  BUN on admission  and AKI greater than or equal to stage   was associated with a higher risk of in hospital mortality 
There was no significant association between in hospital mortality and proteinuria and or hematuria  Table  AKI is common among hospitalized patients  incidence  –  and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality       
In our cohort of   COVID  patients  a relatively higher percentage of patients     of   developed in hospital AKI 
Current evidence suggests that AKI in COVID  patients is a result of an interplay of virus mediated injury  a dysregulated inflammatory response  angiotensin II pathway activation  hypercoagulation  and microangiopathy   
These COVID specific factors likely interact with the other known risk factors for AKI  such as hemodynamic instability  hypoxia  and sepsis  which increased over time 
The increase in the cumulative incidence of AKI over time in our cohort is likely associated with concomitant clinical deterioration and less likely represent a unique renal effect of COVID 
Compared to studies of AKI in COVID  patients from other countries  we found our incidence to be higher than that reported from   Asian countries  –  and is similar to that in an Italian study             
However  it is lower than that in the more recent report by Hirsch et al 
  who detailed their experience in   academic and community hospitals in metropolitan New York   none of which are located in the inner city  lower socioeconomic neighborhoods with a predominant minority population 
As compared with the above cited studies  the incidence of stage   AKI   was highest in our cohort 
It is not possible to determine with certainty the cause s  of this wide variation 
However  we did note a higher prevalence of comorbid conditions in our group 
For example  Cheng et al 
  reported a   incidence of AKI  with a   prevalence of HTN and a   prevalence of DM in their study population 
In our cohort  roughly twice as many   had HTN  and more than   times as many   were diabetic  Table  
Also  the incidence of severe lung involvement that required mechanical ventilation was lower   than ours    Table  
Mechanical ventilation per se has been reported to be strongly associated with AKI   
In our cohort  the incidence of AKI was also higher among those requiring mechanical ventilation  We identified various risk factors for AKI in our study  Tables    
Similar to previous reports  our patients with AKI were more likely to be male  have a history of HTN  and have severe respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation     
In our study  higher BMI increased the likelihood of developing severe AKI 
A low eGFR at presentation more than doubled the risk of developing AKI  p      Table  
Patients with lower eGFR had a significantly higher cumulative incidence of AKI than those with eGFR   mL min  m   p     Fig 
 
Thus  there was a synergistic effect of reduced baseline kidney function and subsequent AKI 
We did not find an association between diabetes and in hospital AKI The role of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors  ACEi  in COVID  is a subject of ongoing debate 
ACEi can increase the expression of ACE  the receptor used by SARS CoV  to enter target cells     
However  ACE  has been shown to be beneficial in acute respiratory distress syndrome when replaced     
This possible protective effect is attributed to the degradation of proinflammatory angiotensin II to angiotensin by ACE 
At present  it remains unclear if ACEi facilitate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus    SARS CoV  cellular entry and intracellular virus replication and whether ACEi improve acute respiratory distress syndrome outcomes 
In our cohort  the use of ACEi was significantly higher in patients with a lower admitting eGFR  Table   and in those who experienced AKI  Table  
We found a similar association between AKI and non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs  but not with angiotensin II receptor blockers  ARBs  in our cohort  Table  
Further studies are necessary to delineate the relationship between ACEi  angiotensin II receptor blockers  and COVID  outcomes Markers of acute inflammation  ferritin and CRP  muscle injury  creatinine kinase  myocardial injury  and D dimer levels were significantly higher in patients with a low eGFR at presentation  online suppl 
Table   and in those with AKI  online suppl 
Table   suggesting causality by a dysregulated immune inflammatory response  the so called  cytokine storm We found an extremely high incidence of mortality in our study cohort 
High presenting BUN and low eGFR   mL min  m  were significantly associated with increased mortality  Table  
AKI was significantly associated with increased mortality 
The mortality risk was highest in stage   AKI  HR   CI  –   Table  
Mortality was   in the AKI group and   in the non AKI group  p    
Mortality rose concurrently with the AKI stages      and   for stages     and   respectively  Table  
These rates were over   and  fold higher than those reported by Hirsch et al 
    AKI    in non AKI 
However  our cohort s high mortality is similar to the findings of John Hopkins University and the American Community Survey 
They reported a   and  fold higher COVID  infection and mortality rate in predominantly African American counties than in predominantly white counties   
Wadhera et al 
  also reported a death rate of   per   in Brooklyn  about   higher than that of Manhattan 
Moreover  in New York City  current age adjusted mortality is highest among African Americans and about   times that of whites   Our hospital provides medical services for an ethnic minority and a low income population in the most impoverished neighborhood in Brooklyn  where   of the residents live below the Federal Poverty Level as per a   report   
  of our patients identified themselves as African Americans 
In comparison  in the study by Hirsch et al 
     identified themselves as whites  and only   identified themselves as African Americans 
The high representation of ethnic minorities in our study population may have contributed to the increased mortality 
This association has been widely publicized and is likely the result of a complex interplay of multiple factors 
These include  but are not limited to  a high burden of comorbidities  genetics  the pernicious influence of adverse socioeconomic determinants of health  the absence of the privilege to work from home  and the ability to follow the recommended social distancing   In our cohort      of the   patients with AKI required RRT 
Nineteen out of these   patients   were mechanically ventilated 
Thus  almost all of the additional requirements for acute dialysis during the COVID  pandemic at our institution were in intensive care units 
Overall      out of   of mechanically ventilated patients required RRT 
Elevated ferritin was associated with an increased risk of all stages of AKI and the need for RRT  online suppl 
Table  
Among those who received RRT      died versus     in the stage   AKI group who did not undergo RRT  p      Table  
Thus  there was no statistically significant improvement in survival  and the mortality remained extremely high in both the RRT and non RRT groups 
These findings should prompt the early involvement of a palliative care team to define goals of care in patients with COVID  disease and stage   AKI In our experience  ultrafiltration was not well tolerated 
It often increased pressor requirements and did little to improve the ventilatory status 
We observed a high incidence of hypercoagulability and frequent clotting of the dialysis filters  lines  and catheters 
Thus  the patients required higher than the usual doses of heparin Our study has limitations 
Although     of the study population had a low eGFR on admission  only     had a documented history of CKD 
Data were collected retrospectively from medical records and often did not have information regarding prior renal function 
Patients also may have had an elevated creatinine on admission secondary to AKI suffered prior to hospitalization 
If so  we may have underestimated the true overall incidence of COVID associated AKI 
It is not possible to rectify this problem  given the data at our disposal Our study is a single center study  with the majority of the study population identifying themselves as African Americans or Hispanics 
This limits our study s general applicability but provides a unique insight into this population and broadens our understanding of COVID  disease 
Data were missing on many patients at different stages of the hospitalization since they were collected retrospectively 
Importantly  little data were available regarding urine output  a defining characteristic of AKI 
With this lack of information  we may have again underestimated the true incidence of AKI Nevertheless  even with the above limitations of our study  the high incidence of AKI and its negative impact upon survival is abundantly clear 
In response to the high incidence of AKI in our patients with COVID  we increased our capacity to deliver RRT 
These efforts included the purchase of additional machines and dialysis solutions  additional staff training  and engineering alterations to allow dialysis on the general medical floors 
Also  we increased our stockpiles of catheters  filters  and dialysis solutions for intermittent and continuous RRT 
We also plan to establish a peritoneal dialysis program to further strengthen our acute dialysis capacity In conclusion  our data report explicitly upon a high proportion of ethnic minority patients in an inner city  severely economically deprived neighborhood  previously not studied 
Our patients experienced a high incidence of AKI and an extremely high mortality  especially in AKI stage  
Unfortunately  RRT provided little survival benefit

  supervisor Dynamic changes in computed tomography manifestations of   patients
with novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan  ChinaDuring the first week of December   a few cases of pneumonia caused by a novel
coronavirus appeared in Wuhan  Hubei Province  China 
The patients had a history of
visiting the nearby Huanan seafood market  where wild animals were sold  With the spread of the disease  such cases have also been found in other
parts of China and abroad 
As of   July     cases have been confirmed
worldwide  including   deaths and   recoveries The novel coronavirus was originally named   novel coronavirus  nCoV  it was
recently officially renamed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus  
 SARS CoV  by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses 
The disease
caused by SARS CoV  has been named coronavirus disease    COVID  by the World
Health Organization 
Like SARS CoV  SARS CoV  likely originated in bats  however 
the intermediary animal host remains unclear 
The nearest neighbor of the  nCoV
isolates from China is a bat SARS like coronavirus  Bat SL CoVZC SARS CoV  carries a high risk of human to human transmission  and such transmission
has been reported in family clusters and among medical workers  The main route of transmission
is respiratory droplets and contact transmission  the virus may also be transmitted
through the conjunctiva and via aerosols  Current epidemiological surveys indicate that the latency period generally
ranges from   to   days  with a maximum of   days 
Affected patients present with
pneumonia like symptoms  including fever  fatigue  cough  expectoration 
pharyngalgia  anorexia  and myalgia 
Some patients also have gastrointestinal
symptoms  including diarrhea  nausea  vomiting  and abdominal pain 
In severe cases 
patients may rapidly develop acute respiratory distress syndrome  septic shock 
difficult to correct metabolic acidosis  and coagulation dysfunction Increasing numbers of studies are suggesting the high clinical value of imaging
examinations  especially high resolution computed tomography  HRCT  of the chest  in
patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia –  Typical CT imaging
manifestations include multiple patchy subsegmental or segmental ground glass
opacities  GGOs  and consolidation in the bilateral lungs  The imaging manifestations in patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia often
change rapidly  and many patients thus undergo repeated CT examinations 
Some
patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia gradually improve  whereas others develop
persistent hypoxemia or dyspnea and gradually worsen 
The changes in the patient s
condition are often closely related to the severity of the lung lesions 
Therefore 
observing the evolution of the lung lesions by chest CT is very important to assess
and predict the patient s outcome This study was to performed observe the changes in the chest HRCT manifestations of
  patients with pneumonia caused by SARS CoV  from the time of the initial
diagnosis 
To our knowledge  this is the largest population evaluated to date among
studies of the dynamic changes in imaging manifestations of novel coronavirus
pneumonia Consecutive patients were retrospectively enrolled in this single center study
from   January   to   February  
These patients met the Diagnosis and
Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia  trial version   issued by the National
Health Commission of the People s Republic of China  and their diagnoses were confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction 
According to the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus
Pneumonia  trial version   issued by the Chinese National Health Committee 
patients who developed severe pneumonia during their disease course were
excluded 
Severe pneumonia was defined as severe respiratory distress
 respiratory rate of   breaths minute  a requirement for oxygen treatment
or mechanical ventilation  an oxygen saturation of   on room air  a
partial arterial oxygen pressure fraction of inspired oxygen ratio of ≤  mmHg 
shock  or pneumonia combined with other organ failure All patients were examined using a Discovery CT  HD scanner  GE Healthcare 
Chicago  IL  USA  during a single inspiratory phase 
Before the examination  the
medical staff guided the patient to hold his or her breath and inhale 
After
complete exhalation  the patient held his or her breath  and a CT scan was
performed from the bottom of the lung to the apex of the lung 
The tube voltage
was   kVp with automatic tube current modulation 
The scan time was   s  the
scan interval was   mm  and the scan layer thickness was   mm 
After scanning 
adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction of   and the standard algorithm
were adopted  and the reconstruction layer thickness was   mm 
No contrast
agent was used during the CT scan 
Most patients underwent multiple chest CT
examinations  largely because the clinicians were still unclear about the
evolution tendencies of the lung lesions associated with COVID  pneumonia 
Additionally  some patients had symptoms such as hypoxemia or dyspnea due to
rapid disease progression 
Therefore  multiple chest CT examinations were
required to observe the progress or absorption of pneumonia The major CT manifestations were described using internationally standard
nomenclature defined by the Fleischner Society glossary  using terms such as
GGO  consolidation  and fibrous strips  A semi quantitative scoring system was used to estimate the pulmonary
involvement of all of these abnormalities on the basis of the area involved  Each of the five lung lobes was visually scored from   to   as follows 
  no involvement      involvement      to   involvement      to
  involvement      to   involvement  and     involvement 
The
total CT score was the sum of the individual lobar scores and ranged from    no
involvement  to    maximum involvement 
The number of affected lung lobes was
also recorded 
The images were transferred to an AW  workstation  GE
Healthcare  and anonymized 
All images were evaluated by two radiologists with
more than   years of work experience  and the final scores were determined by
consensus Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS Statistics for Windows  Version
   SPSS Inc  Chicago  IL  USA 
Measurement data are expressed as
mean   standard deviation  minimum–maximum  and categorical data are presented
as the percentage of the group 
A P value of   was defined as
statistically significant In total    CT scans of   patients   men    women  with confirmed COVID 
were collected 
The patients  ages ranged from   to   years  and their mean
age was       years 
Fever was the most common symptom  Table  
The patients
underwent        –  chest CT examinations  and the interval between the
first and last scan was       days  –  days The laboratory results are presented in Table  
Most laboratory results were
normal  with mildly elevated concentrations of C reactive protein
      mg L  D dimers       mg L  and ferritin      
µg L Based on clinical experience  five stages were identified from the onset of
initial symptoms  Stage A  –  days  n     Stage B  –  days  n     Stage
C  –  days  n     Stage D  –  days  n     and Stage E   days 
n    
One patient had a  day history of cough with fever and was in Stage B
at the time of admission 
The frequencies of different lesions in different
stages are presented in Table  
Two patients in Stage A and one patient in Stage E had no
lesions 
Multiple lobes were involved in most of the CT scans in all stages 
Multiple lobe involvement was present in     patients in Stage A   
  in Stage B      in Stage C      in Stage D  and    
in Stage E  GGOs could be seen in all stages  and the proportion of GGOs in each
stage was similar 
The proportion of consolidation first increased and then
decreased over time 
GGOs and consolidation were present in     and  
  patients in Stage A      and     in Stage B     
and     in Stage C      and     in Stage D  and    
and     in Stage E  respectively 
The consolidations in some cases were
absorbed As shown in Table  
the total CT score also first increased and then decreased over time  and the
total CT score of pulmonary involvement was significantly higher in Stage B than
in Stage A       vs        respectively  P    
Additionally  the
total CT score of lung involvement was significantly higher in Stage C than in
Stages B and D       vs         P     and       vs       
 P     respectively 
The number of involved lobes was significantly higher
in Stage B than in Stage A       vs        respectively  P    
Notably  the CT score of the lower lobe was significantly higher than the
corresponding upper and middle lobes in Stages A  B  C  and D  P     for
all 
In Stage E  the CT score of the right lower lobe was significantly higher
than that of the right upper middle lobes  P     and P    
respectively  whereas no significant difference was observed in the CT score
between the left lower lobe and left upper lobe The CT images of a patient with novel coronavirus pneumonia are shown in Figure  
GGOs and
consolidation first increased from Stage A to Stage C  after which the
consolidation gradually absorbed  the GGOs then gradually decreased in Stages D
and E Since the end of   an outbreak of a novel pneumonia in Wuhan has been drawing
tremendous attention around the world 
Chinese government officials and researchers
have taken swift measures to control the outbreak and conduct etiological studies 
The causative agent of this pneumonia has been identified as SARS CoV  a novel
coronavirus 
As its name suggests  its genetic structure is   similar to that of SARS CoV The most frequently affected organ of the novel coronavirus is the lung 
In the
previous version of the diagnosis and treatment guideline for pneumonia caused by
novel coronavirus  the diagnosis was confirmed by the presence of viral nucleic
acids in throat swabs  sputum  and alveolar lavage fluid 
However  the more recent
guideline indicates that if typical chest CT findings are observed in patients
suspected to have COVID  the patient should be clinically diagnosed 
This
reflects the important role of chest CT in the diagnosis 
Moreover  current clinical
experience is showing that the chest CT manifestations change rapidly 
Therefore 
many patients in the present study underwent multiple repeated examinations during
treatment 
To our knowledge  this study is by far the largest case series of
follow up imaging among patients with COVID SARS CoV  infects human respiratory epithelial cells through S protein and has a
strong infection capacity for humans 
Coronavirus particles have a diameter of   to
  nm and can directly reach the bottom of the lung 
Because of lung volume and
gravity  respiratory airflow  and other factors  the type II alveolar epithelial
cells present at the bottom of the lung become the target cells of the coronavirus 
Therefore  the lesions are mainly distributed under the pleura or along the vascular
bronchial bundle  After the alveolar epithelial cells have become combined with the virus  the
alveolar wall is damaged and large numbers of immune cells and lymphocytes
accumulate  resulting in swelling around the lung leaflets and blood vessel
congestion 
The pulmonary lobules merge with each other  forming nodular or patchy
GGOs 
As the disease progresses  multiple lung segments become involved  the scope
of the lesion expands  the alveolar wall shrinks and collapses  and the exfoliated
and necrotic epithelium and the exuded inflammatory cells form a hyaline membrane 
These changes manifest as coexisting imaging abnormalities such as GGOs  nodules 
consolidation  and fibrous cord strips Several studies have focused on the evolution of CT changes in patients with COVID 
pneumonia 
Pan et al  analyzed the disease course according to  day stages and found that the CT
score was the highest on days   to   of the disease course  after   days  the CT
score of the lower lung was significantly higher than that of the middle and upper
lungs 
Zhou et al  found that CT images of patients with COVID  pneumonia showed a
predominantly peripheral  middle  lower  and posterior distribution 
The early rapid
progressive stage was   to   days from symptom onset  the advanced stage with peak
levels of CT abnormalities occurred from   to   days  and the abnormalities started
to improve after   days 
Lei et al  reported that patients with COVID  pneumonia had a typical transition from
the early stage to the advanced stage and then from the advanced stage to the
dissipating stage 
Single or multiple GGOs were distributed along the
bronchovascular or subpleural regions in the pulmonary parenchyma in the early
stage  higher density consolidations were observed in the advanced stage  and the
GGOs and consolidations were absorbed in the dissipating stage 
Xiang et al  evaluated only six patients with COVID  pneumonia and reported that the CT
score peaked at   to   days and that the CT scores of the lower lobes were
significantly higher than those of the middle upper lobes after   days from disease
onset 
These findings were consistent with those reported by Pan et al  Liang et al  reported that the majority of patients had involvement of three or more
lobes 
Bilateral involvement was more prevalent than unilateral involvement 
The
proportions of patients observed to have pure GGOs or GGOs and consolidation
decreased over time  while the proportion of patients with GGOs and linear opacities
increased 
The total severity score showed an increasing trend in the first   weeks 
Bernheim et al  divided the disease course into three stages  –   –  and  –  days  and
found that   of patients in the first stage had normal CT findings 
As the time
since onset of symptoms increased  the CT abnormalities became more frequent  these
findings included consolidation  bilateral and peripheral disease  greater total
lung involvement  linear opacities  the  crazy paving  pattern  and the  reverse
halo  sign In this study  we evaluated the CT findings of   patients with COVID  pneumonia
confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction 
The patients underwent
a mean of        range   –  chest CT examinations 
At present  the course of
COVID  pneumonia and when patients should be re examined remain inconclusive 
As
mentioned above  different studies have staged the disease according to different
time periods 
We grouped the patients  CT scans at different time intervals 
The
time interval grouping was based on current clinical experience and is consistent
with the imaging interval described in the pneumonia diagnosis and treatment guidelines  This grouping is also partially similar to that described by Pan et al  and Zhou et al  Multiple lobe involvement was observed in most patients in all stages  and
lower lobe lesions were significantly more common than upper and middle lobe
lesions  this is also consistent with the findings reported by Pan et al  and Liang et al  As mentioned above  most studies have suggested that patients with COVID 
pneumonia undergo a typical transition from the early stage to the advanced stage
and then from the advanced stage to the dissipating stage  however  the time to
reach the peak of the disease course varies among different studies  and the
patients in our study showed a similar tendency 
GGOs and consolidation were the
common chest CT manifestations  the proportion of GGOs in each stage was similar 
while consolidation and the total CT score first increased and then decreased over
time 
The total CT score was significantly higher in Stage B than in Stage A  while
the total CT score was significantly higher in Stage C than in Stage B 
These
findings suggest that the lung lesions of most patients significantly improved after
  days and that most patients with new coronavirus pneumonia had a disease course
of more than   days This study had three main limitations 
First  we did not consider the effects of
factors such as age  sex  medical history  including hypertension  hyperlipidemia 
hyperglycemia  and malignant tumors  and lifestyle habits  including smoking and
drinking history  on patient outcomes 
Second  although   patients with novel
coronavirus pneumonia were included in this study  the number of patients in Stages
B to E was limited 
Future studies should include more patients and extend the
observation time to ensure that the study results are more representative 
Third 
some studies have suggested that factors such as age  the C reactive protein
concentration  and the interleukin  β concentration may be related to patient
outcomes 
However  we did not perform a correlation analysis between the laboratory
data and patient outcomes In conclusion  we followed up and evaluated   chest CT scans of   patients with
confirmed COVID  pneumonia and found that most patients had a disease course of
more than   days and that the lung lesions of most patients improved significantly
after   days 
The purpose of this study is to help clinicians better understand the
disease course and properly perform chest CT re examinations for patients with
COVID  pneumonia to minimize the radiation dose Transdermal Delivery Systems for BiomoleculesDrug delivery is related to many problems focused on the molecular stability  pharmacokinetic  and amphoteric nature of a substance 
Due to chemical instability and high degradation by enzymatic action regardless of the distance to the specific target organ  all of this is more complicated when the bioactive substance that is intended to be administered is a biomolecule  such as peptides and proteins   Currently  there is a system that is applied to the protein drug delivery  which is a non conventional system developed primarily for protein and peptide drug delivery 
This new delivery system has a higher efficiency that improves the passage of the protein drug to the skin   
The transdermal drug delivery  TDD  system reduces potential exposure to side effects in the host and improves protein stability by also reducing enzymatic degradation  which is very common to occur when a drug takes the most conventional routes to enter the body  such as oral and subcutaneous routes 
Mainly  TDD systems avoid the first pass of metabolism  which occurs in the liver   
The protein and peptide drugs are important in many innovative treatments  such as immunotherapy  where biomolecules  such as antibodies  growth factors  and interleukins  are used 
These are proteins with high susceptibility to degradation to many endogenous and exogenous factors  such as temperature and pH  and most importantly  enzymatic degradation and immune clearance One of the most important advantages of the transdermal route is to maintain drug release in a constant and prolonged release to achieve optimal blood circulation concentrations   
For transdermal protein drug delivery systems  specific methods or devices are used to allow or enhance intact passage through the stratum corneum  SC 
The most suitable systems for the release of biomolecules are the third generation transdermal delivery systems  whose effects are directed to the SC 
For TDD systems of biomolecules and vaccines  thermal ablation and microneedles are the most widely used physical penetration enhancers 
However  there are many other systems that have been tested for transdermal release of biomolecules   that have been included in the second and third generation of transdermal delivery systems  such as iontophoresis and electroporation This article highlights the main technologies used as tools that improve transdermal protein drug delivery systems  addressing them from the point of view of research in the development of transdermal systems where many technologies and devices have a high possibility of use in conventional drug treatments  such as nanotechnology devices 
The authors provide an overview of the various systems that exist in TDD that have been tested and proposed for the transdermal delivery of biomolecules The skin is a three layer laminate that is made up of the SC  the epidermis  and the dermis   
The epidermis is the outermost layer and is formed from the stratified epithelium  the stratum germinativum  spinosum  granulosum  lucidum  and corneum   Fig 
 The SC is the outermost and impermeable skin layer that prevents the entry of most chemicals   
This barrier is formed by around   to   lines of dead keratinocytes  corneocytes  that have united with each other with corneodesmosomes forming a wall embedded in a lipidic matrix 
The extracellular matrix is formed by lipids  such as fatty acids  ceramides  cholesterol  cholesterol sulfate  and sterol wax esters arranged in lamellae  and multiple lipid bilayers  although the matrix is primarily composed of ceramides     
Corneocytes contain involucrin  loricrin  and cornifin around their periphery and have a thickness of   μm  but this can be modified by factors such as hydration and the anatomic site of the skin   
This stratum contains high amounts of keratin inside the corneocytes  and the keratin filaments provide the hexagonal shape and stratum mechanical strength of the corneocyte   
In addition  the SC acts as a barrier  preventing desiccation and pathogen entry and protecting against ultraviolet rays 
The SC also plays an important role in wound repair The transdermal delivery route has been used many times for the local application of therapeutic substances  and it is a practice that is still used and that will continue to grow in the coming years The transdermal drug delivery systems also allow homogeneous absorption and have good pharmaceutical efficiency  reducing the adverse effects that drugs could cause in the host and reduce the drug risk to suffer alterations caused by enzymatic factors and the immune system present in the intrinsic environment 
Besides that  these systems are more comfortable for the patient   This method is formed by steps that start when the therapeutic molecule enters the skin until it enters the blood circulation 
The first step is penetration  which occurs when the drug is deposited onto the specific skin layer 
Later  the permeation step occurs when the molecule diffuses from one layer to another 
Finally  in the resorption process  the drug enters the bloodstream     This type of drug delivery system has advantages over traditional systems because it can allow the storage of small amounts of drugs in the transport and delivery structure  which are developed by nanotechnology using mainly polymeric nanomaterials made with biopolymers  microneedles  and nanoparticles With these devices  it is possible to improve drug delivery and its bioavailability 
Thus  it is possible to reduce the frequency between drug administrations 
The most innovative property is that the device is only replaced when the dose is finished and it can take several days     
The exact side effects that they could trigger are unknown  since they could mainly depend on the type of bioactive drug it contains  which could be related to some effects of the mechanical properties of the skin    Table  Peptides and proteins have long been important resources in the treatment of many diseases 
Many of the therapies that are applied for many diseases have recently used peptides and proteins  which is called biological therapy and focuses on the production of the main proteins obtained from living organisms such as transforming bacteria The main diseases which are treated with proteins are diabetes  hemophilia  infectious diseases  and anemia 
These therapeutic proteins are primarily hormones  interleukins  anticoagulants  and enzymes  which are recombinant proteins 
Other protein drugs  such as calcitonin  rituximab  gemtuzumab  insulin  epidermal growth factor  and interferons  are best known for their importance in the treatment of osteoporosis  lymphoma  leukemia  and diabetes mellitus   The most employed biological protein therapy is immunotherapy  which has several applications 
One of the most important applications is cancer treatment  which is a specific treatment that employs cytokines  a kind of protein produced by the immunity system that helps the patient s immune system eliminate cancer cells and prevents the replication of cancer cells 
These immune proteins are classified in therapeutic groups known as cytokines  monoclonal antibodies  tyrosine kinase inhibitor  and rapamycin receptor inhibitors in mammals  mTOR    
Two main kinds of cytokines are the most importantly used in biological therapies  interleukins and interferons 
Production is carried out with laboratory animals and once extracted and purified  they are used by injection into a human recipient for clinical treatment  e g  monoclonal antibodies 
However  there are many applications for products  such as antibodies obtained from live organisms and these are used mainly for the prevention of diseases such as in the development of vaccines 
The most important pharmaceutical products are listed in Table     Each one of these peptides or proteins has a different method of administration  such as intravenous  oral  topical  or intravesical 
Some other proposed methods of administration that would avoid the difficulties of the route of administration and offer comfort to the user include the nasal  pulmonary  ocular  and rectal routes    which could be as invasive as the traditional routes in many cases 
The main drawback of this type of therapies is that traditional administration such as subcutaneous injection and intravenous administration can modify their effectiveness  since the route of administration may vary in different clinical circumstances  for example  it may contribute to an increase in blood pressure   When any substance  including proteins  enters the bloodstream regardless of the route of administration  these proteins are exposed to many environmental threats such as sequestration by the reticuloendothelial system mainly for macrophage internalization  enzymatic degradation and absorption and elimination of serum proteins by the liver  –   which is an important factor to consider  since it represents a low efficiency in the application of biological therapy due to its high rate of degradation and elimination   
In addition to protecting the lability of all therapeutic proteins  it is also about preventing them from exerting their activity in places that do not require it 
Although immunotherapy is more effective and less toxic than therapies made with chemical molecules  these immune proteins also trigger adverse effects in the host  such as autoimmunities and non specific inflammatory processes   
For these reasons  research is being carried out on the use of alternative technologies with which these side effects can be controlled  such as with the use of nanotechnology using polymers  with which these proteins can be protected  favoring their transport and direct delivery to their objective  preventing them from exerting their toxic effect on non specific cells and sites   Nanocarriers  such as nanotubes    microneedles  MNs   –   fusion peptide carriers    or peptide conjugated nanoparticles  NPs      are some of the main carriers and protective systems used in immunotherapy  regardless of the size or structure of the molecule to be transported and protected  which could be genetic material  interferon  interleukins  or antibodies In   the US FDA approved the use of TDD systems and their use has been increasing in relevance for protein drugs because for some molecules these delivery systems improve the solubility of the compound  in addition to allowing it to pass efficiently through the skin There are important findings in research revealing that TDD technologies allow the loading  transport  and release of protein drugs 
They are very promising for the effective treatment of local cancers  with skin location  and they have a second benefit of activating the immune system from a remote distance 
Some of them have been developed to carry ribonucleic acid  RNA  that can regulate localized gene expression within a known target 
In other cases  it is possible to use an immunologic protein that could produce a strong adaptive immune response against a specific antigen in the case of vaccines  where it could be made with the tumor antigen expressed in the gene  tumor related protein or peptide  specific epitope  or cell lysate   For immunotherapy  it might be possible to employ monoclonal antibody loaded TDD systems and tumor agnostic therapies  non specific immunotherapies  use of interferons and interleukins  and cancer theranostic treatment where SC could be interrupted by a nanogel delivering a drug through the skin and allowing it to accumulate at the tumor site   or these systems may even function by delivering vaccine antigens  cancer vaccines  using nanoparticles and liposomes as antigenic carriers loaded on nanogels to pass the antigen through the SC by iontophoresis   
It is also possible to use microneedles loaded with Dermatophagoides farinae extract to achieve effective allergen release and effective immune response induction   These strategies have a wide range of application in various skin pathological circumstances  in addition to their main role in cancer therapy  and many products are used for the treatment of cancer 
Some of the commercial pharmaceutical products used for cancer therapy  which are administered transdermally  are described in Table     Through the use of transdermal delivery systems  it is sought to increase the solubility and stability  the circulating life  and the pharmacokinetic properties of drug proteins and peptides 
It is recommended to consider that the TDD system is not applicable to many of the biomolecules that are used as medical treatments since the success in the transdermal passage could depend on certain factors 
The efficacy of this therapeutic system depends both on the physical and chemical properties of the proteins and on the percutaneous administration systems of biomolecules to be used 
Regarding protein  the main physical properties to consider are the shape and size  molecular weight  solubility  and amphoteric nature  the latter being perhaps one of the most important to consider since due to its amphoteric property it can migrate in an electric field and its migration direction depends on the net charge that it has 
The knowledge of this property could help to elucidate which are the best percutaneous administration systems to facilitate passage through the SC 
In the case of charged proteins  physical  electrical  enhancers are the best option to use 
The chemical nature of proteins is another especially important factor to know 
This composition could help us to choose the best TDD system through which the protein will pass through the SC avoiding the reactivity of some functional groups of proteins 
For these reasons  there is little increase in the development of new therapeutic formulations administered by TDD systems  since there are some protein properties that need to be studied and analyzed to know if they can be administered by this route without affecting its stability and pharmacokinetic properties Peptides are molecules that have a molecular weight between   Da and   kDa 
This molecular weight depends on the molecular structures and their lengths with a small amount of amino acids or constitutes a protein with a complex structure 
These molecules are charged in a physiological pH and are hydrophilic  which complicates their permeability across the skin 
Some drugs have a lower or higher affinity with the lipophilic condition of the SC  which determines the quantity of the molecule that can cross this layer of the skin naturally 
Therefore  it is better to use a technique that improves passage to the skin  using or not natural permeation molecular routes avoiding the degradation of peptides or proteins and ensuring passage and integrity during the transport and release processes   There are important skin conditions that can change permeability  such as age  heat  racial differences  freezing  abrasion  chemical irritant activity  and some diseases such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis 
It is very important to recognize these for the development and use of devices employed in transdermal protein drug delivery In the skin  three molecular permeation routes are the most important  intracellular  intercellular  and follicular routes 
All of these are beneficiated by the concentration gradient of the molecules present in the milieu  allowing passive diffusion across the SC   
Moreover  physicochemical properties from the molecule affect its passage through the SC 
Hydrophobic molecules can cross the SC intercellularly  whereas hydrophilic molecules cross intracellularly by corneocytes 
Passage through the skin can take place through so called cutaneous defects  in which the skin has a discontinuity  such as sweat glands or hair shafts   In the skin  the SC and lipid layers have a barrier function  as both prevent the loss of water and avoid the entry of any substances  molecules  or microorganisms from the environment or microbiome 
These layers play a crucial role in the passive passage of proteins and other chemicals into the skin 
The liquid flux between the lipid layer depends on the lamellar and linear lipid matrix arrangement 
The lamellar layer is generally oriented parallel to the SC  and linear lipids are perpendicular to the SC 
If no long periodicity phase  LPP  exists  the permeability increases   
However  if the orthorhombic phase  OP  predominates  the permeability of the lipids is reduced  and if the OP predominates in the lateral layer  the permeation decreases   
The LPP is primarily formed by ceramides  cholesterol  and free fatty acids  and these have a unique tri layer organization  while an all trans chain lipid organization exists in the OP phase  which has a rectangular crystalline lattice and no mobility Transdermal drug delivery has been used for many years  and the skin was thought to be impervious to exogenous chemical molecules 
Currently  it is known that the skin is a semi permeable barrier  which allows its use as a transport route for molecules  allowing the molecule to reach the therapeutic target intact 
However  due to its anatomy  hydrophilic molecules can only pass through the skin if they are small  and even then  in many cases  they require help from an electric field  electrotherapies  as in the case of electroporation   and iontophoresis   
These techniques use a low voltage supplementation  direct current  around the drug site  allowing and enhancing passage through the skin   
When an electric field is applied to the skin  a large molecular movement occurs and the molecule can take the path of the hair follicle through the skin or induce pore formation     There is another technology using acoustic transmission  sonophoresis  that is used in medical trials  such as hyperthermia treatment  physical therapy  and ultrasonic surgery  which has the ability to facilitate drug transport to the skin   
Through this technique  mechanical waves of medium or low frequency are transferred to a physical medium  such as a specific gel  which allows it to propagate and transmit energy 
In the ultrasonic system  wave sounds have an oscillation frequency greater than   kHz   The TDD systems are an alternative route that allows the control of the drug release and decreases the possibility of any side effects associated with levels that are higher than the minimum pharmacological concentration  reducing pharmacological dosing times because a patch is administered every   to   h  This eliminates the risk of metabolism of the therapeutic agent and the loss of the available dose 
In addition  there are other advantages  such as the noninvasive drug delivery method  which can be discontinued at any time   
To facilitate TDD to improve SC permeation  some technologies improve drug flux of difficult drugs    such as cryioneumatic and photpneumatic technologies  sonphoresis  iontophoresis  electroporation  jet injection  and MN  which are used in the delivery of many drugs   The disadvantage in the above cases is that all devices require a low voltage supplement 
In addition  it is necessary to purchase equipment to manage the electrical current 
In addition  in some people it can cause sensitivity  such as tingling and irritation  and the technique can even cause blistering of the skin 
In these cases  when the technique is not well applied  it can cause burns to the skin 
In all circumstances  these techniques must be applied by trained personnel Despite these drawbacks  considerable research has been focused on the transport of peptides through the skin with good results 
In Table   we list some examples of these studies  the biomolecules and penetration enhancers  and the main result of each 
The table also indicates whether the physical penetration enhancer acts alone or is enhanced by a combination with another enhancer or nanocarrier    –  Many compounds have been employed to improve the penetration of substances across the skin  such as azone  pyrrolidones  alkanols  sulfoxides  glycols  alcohols  and surfactants   
Each of the chemical penetration enhancers has a specific action mechanism in the skin penetration process Due to the characteristics of the upper layer of the skin  which is specialized in avoiding and preventing the entry of any molecule or pathogen  the SC is complicated in terms of the passage of molecules greater than   Da  but it is not impossible 
In many cases  this process can be carried out using penetration enhancer molecules  which have good results in terms of penetration of molecules through the skin 
However  it represents a disadvantage because it could permit not only pathogens but also microorganisms in the cutaneous microbiota to enter as a consequence of cellular disruption integrity and the focal detachment of superficial corneocytes  such as in the use of thioglycolate in depilatory treatments   
The process of percutaneous absorption of a therapeutic molecule consists of several processes  which include the dissolution and release of the therapeutic agent  partition and diffusion within the SC  partition from the SC to the aqueous phase of the epidermis and its diffusion  and finally  access to the systemic circulation and target tissue There are three routes through which any molecule can breach this and reach the microcirculation through the tissue 
These are the intercellular  transcellular  and transappendageal routes  but the route can depend on the drug s molecular weight  Fig 
    Chemical penetration enhancers are a good alternative to allow the passage of biomolecules  but most of them cause skin irritation  which is uncomfortable for patients   
In many cases  the penetration enhancers have synergic activity when they are used in combination    but they can generate more skin irritation problems 
The mode of action of these enhancers is different for each one and depends on the mechanism by which it interacts with the compounds of the SC 
Due to this capacity  it has been classified according to their interaction ability in those that  a  interact with lipid heads within aqueous domains of the lipid bilayers and interact with the lipid alkyl chain   b  interact with actin filaments in the corneocytes   c  allow partitioning augmentation and increase drug protein solubility in the SC  and  d  improve penetration indirectly  modifying the drug  Fig 
    
Some of the most studied chemical penetration enhancers are the terpenes  amide  fatty acids  monoglycerides  and surfactants  and some of the most commonly studied are  D limonene  azone  lauric acid  monoolein and sodium lauryl sulfate   Depending on their chemical structure  some polymers can transport drug molecules within their structure  as in the case of cyclodextrins and their derivatives together with other saccharides  moieties  that can transport drugs as ketoprofen   or biomolecules such as levothyroxine sodium  T  which has been used as a topical treatment to eliminate lipid deposits in subcutaneous adipose tissue 
The main problem with this type of application has been the IT  detection in rabbits   h after the application of the cream 
The use of dimethyl cyclodextrin as a solubilizer for levothyroxine increased its solubility  but unfortunately  it only succeeded in penetrating much less levothyroxine through the skin than the required dose in humans   
In this way  it is important to highlight that the complex improves the solubility of the molecule allowing it to pass through the SC  and in another specific treatment  it could recognize a specific target in the cell plasma membrane and then adhere to it and release its content in a more efficient way Proteins are a substantial problem when we try to pass them through the skin 
First  they are larger  and second  they are highly susceptible to enzymatic degradation 
Not all are thermostable  and finally  another difficulty is that proteins and peptides live for a short time in plasma 
For this  it is necessary to protect them during their trip to the place of action 
Furthermore  this protection enables controlled delivery 
Passing through the skin can be less difficult if the protein is in a capsule  which is best when the capsule size is in the nanometric range Advances in the science of polymers applied in pharmacy have allowed the development of many encapsulation techniques that range from the most impractical to the most revolutionary methods 
However  this reveals a problem  as some polymers are not soluble in water and require organic solvents 
Furthermore  the integrity of the protein to be encapsulated is compromised regardless of the encapsulation technique Many types of polymers could be used in drug delivery  however  their chemical structure and molecular weight do not allow dissolution in water in many cases  and most dissolve well in organic solvents 
The solubility of the polymer is a characteristic that is important to determine before use because it can determine the environmental resistance in the process in which it will be used Biopolymers and their combinations are best used for these procedures  helping to improve the stability of the formulation as in the case of encapsulating transforming growth factor  TGF β  in poly d l lactic co glycolic acid   PLGA  and polyethylene glycol  PEG  polymeric microparticles for bone regeneration   
Insulin loaded PCL PEG PCL NPs are another example where the NPs were prepared by the w o w double emulsion solvent evaporation method and demonstrated satisfactory insulin delivery and efficacy in treating diabetic rats   
These NPs possess a specific protein drug delivery with a delivery degradation speed 
They are hydrophobic or hydrophilic according to what is necessary for the encapsulation procedure and for improvement in the stability of the protein drug 
They have a low or no chance of rejection and are safe to use Encapsulation processes are classified into two types  chemical and mechanical  which are then classified according to the methodology used to make the capsule 
This can be determined according to the desired size  shape  and composition surface chemistry 
The encapsulation of biomolecules by these methods allows us to avoid the degradation of the free protein and allows the prolonged and constant release of a protein drug in constant time     With these methods  it is possible to obtain nano sized particles  which are especially important to avoid their elimination by the immune system and the liver   
Smaller and softer particles can better evade the immune system  and this can be compatible with the recipient organism 
It is important to note that capsules with a diameter size of ≤  μm have the risk of being engulfed by phagocytic immune cells  therefore  the recommended NP size that could have an appropriate delivery range is   to   nm   Dendrimers are three dimensional NPs  like macromolecules  and are considered based on nanometric size 
These are radially symmetric and comprise an inner core structure made up of a central atom covalently bonded between other atoms 
The external composition is highly branched  forming a dendrimer structure 
These branches allow the formation of cavities into which bioactive molecules   can be incorporated  such as proteins   and peptides used for many pathological treatments   and for storage  transport  and controlled delivery There are many types of dendrimer structures  and depending on the synthesis method  these methods could use click chemistry   and divergent and convergent strategies 
In addition  there are different designs and chemical elements 
Their application in the administration of drugs has focused on the fact that these have many biocompatible characteristics 
These characteristics include non immunogenicity  non toxicity  and a high ability to cross biological barriers  such as cell membranes  blood vessels  intestines  and the blood brain barrier   In addition  they have high stability in blood circulation and a prolonged blood circulation half life  and they target specific structures 
These NPs can be manufactured in high purity and have some degree of in vitro toxicity when manufactured with cationic and anionic surface groups 
However  it is possible to reduce this toxicity by using surface protection by PEGs or fatty acids   In TDD systems  dendrimers have been employed for the penetration of nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs  such as indomethacin  which is an arthritis and osteoarthritis auxiliary drug in the treatment of the pain generated from this disease 
There is a study that reports the progress of the TAT PAMAM dendrimer system developed as a non viral vector for the transdermal release of DNA plasmids where the dendrimer system was modified 
The HIV transcriptional transactivator  TAT  was conjugated as a cell penetrating peptide to enhance the uptake of constructed plasmid DNA pIRES H GFP by cells   
Dendrimers are an excellent drug penetration enhancer   and they are some of the best nanostructures that have high applicability in medicine for the delivery of peptides and proteins As mentioned  traditional routes  intradermal  gastric  or intravenous  have long been the main delivery route for all drugs 
Nevertheless  the appearance of an increase in chronic diseases has allowed the development of new technologies that are less invasive and have high efficiency upon reaching the target  especially in cases in which a user must take more than one medicine for the treatment of one or more diseases at a time Although the design and use of MNs can ensure the entrance of molecules across the skin  biomolecules have a high degradation risk that can occur at any time  in the charging process or at the moment of release 
Thus  it is better to protect the protein contained within a specialized structure  such as nanocapsules or dendrimers  NPs in both cases 
This procedure has no danger for the protein or peptide structural composition  which improves the conservation and passage of these compositions across the SC  Fig 
 The PLGA NPs can go through SC better with the help of MNs because the micro conduits created by these needles allow the NPs to avoid the SC barrier and arrive at other skin layers and deliver the complete contents  Fig 
    
For this procedure  it is necessary to consider that  in all cases  the penetration capacity of NPs depends on the particle and channel size   
Despite this important consideration  among others  the procedure also avoids the limitations of the skin s physicochemical properties that do not permit crossing it Some experimental studies have demonstrated the penetration and distribution of PLGA NPs in MNs   
The most common use of NPs MNs is for experimental insulin release systems using murine models in rats with induced diabetes  where the insulin is introduced into H O responsive mesoporous silica NPs  and MN patches are manufactured for later transdermal application 
Its release behavior analysis demonstrated effective release   
For immunity induction  an excellent response occurs when the NPs MNs were employed 
For example  for the induction of immunity against endogenous prostate cancer stem cell antigen RALA pPSCA  the immunization via the NP MN release system resulted in anti tumor activity in both cases of prophylactic and treatment assays in vivo   
Another experimental process that allows probing the system efficacy is the use of poly methylmethacrylate  coated with   nm of gold NPs  which has great potential in tumoral cell destruction   Currently  there are few authorized devices  however  these are increasing because for many treatments  such devices are more appropriately used  effective  and exhibit more recommended results 
Perhaps shortly  these devices will be the most appropriate techniques for drug and protein delivery systems For many decades  a great number of therapies to resolve the problems associated with drug release have been implicated to probe numerous kinds of devices and pharmaceutical innovations to solve many diseases or applications in various clinical trials for the diagnosis of diseases or treatments of diseases 
For this application  it is necessary to design new technologies  and pharmaceutical chemistry has been concerned with offering the best administration methods for therapeutic agents Lately  many research studies have reported numerous results that indicate the most appropriate technologies to use in each case of a drug delivery system 
Each of the aforementioned TDD systems has some advantages and disadvantages for use in administering protein drug delivery However  these technologies create substantial and important opportunities for administering biomolecules 
In the coming years  we will observe an increase in their design  development  characterization  and clinical trials for the treatment of many important and chronic diseases Recombination Every Day  Abundant Recombination in a Virus during a Single Multi Cellular Host InfectionAs increasing numbers of full length viral sequences become available  recombinant or mosaic viruses are being recognized more frequently   
Recombination events have been demonstrated to be associated with viruses expanding their host range   or increasing their virulence    thus accompanying  or perhaps even being at the origin of  major changes during virus adaptation 
It remains unclear  however  whether recombination events represent a highly frequent and significant phenomenon in the everyday life of these viruses Viruses can exchange genetic material when at least two different viral genomes co infect the same host cell 
Progeny can then become hybrid through different mechanisms  such as reassortment of segments when the parental genomes are fragmented    intra molecular recombination when polymerases switch templates  in RNA viruses     or homologous or non homologous recombination  in both RNA and DNA viruses 
Quantification of viral recombination in multi cellular organisms has been attempted under two distinct experimental approaches  in vitro  in cell cultures     and in vivo  in live hosts    
The in vitro approach  which has so far been applied only to animal viruses  allows the establishment of the  intrinsic  recombination rate in experimentally co infected cells in cell cultures   
However  it does not necessarily reflect the situation in entire  living hosts  where the frequency of co infected cells is poorly known and depends on many factors such as the size of the pathogen population  the relative frequency and distribution of the different variants  and host defense mechanisms preventing secondary infection of cells 
The in vivo experimental approach is closer to biological conditions and may thus be more informative of what actually happens in  the real world However  as discussed below  numerous experimental constraints have so far precluded an actual quantification of the baseline rate of recombination 
First  many experimental designs have used extreme positive selection  where only recombinant genomes were viable  e g    
Other studies did not use complementation techniques but detected recombinants by PCR within infected hosts or tissues    which provides information on their presence but not on their frequency in the viral population 
So far  no quantitative PCR or other quantitative method has been applied to evaluate the number of recombinants appearing in an experimentally infected live host 
Finally  recent methods based on sequence analysis inferred the population recombination rate  rather than the individual recombination rate   
While results from these methods certainly take in vivo recombination into account  there are other caveats  isolates have often been collected in different hosts sometimes in different geographical regions and sometimes the selective neutrality of sequence variation on which these estimates are based is not clearly established 
Estimates from such studies by essence address the estimation of the recombination rate at a different evolutionary scale Taken together  the currently available information indicates that no viral recombination rate has ever been estimated directly at time and space scales corresponding to a single multi cellular host infection  although this level is most significant for the biology and evolution of viruses 
This study intends to fill this gap by evaluating the recombination frequency of the cauliflower mosaic virus  CaMV  during a single passage in one of its host plants  the turnip Brassica rapa CaMV is a pararetrovirus  which is a major grouping containing hepadnaviruses  e g  hepatitis B virus  badnaviruses  e g  banana streak virus  and caulimoviruses  e g  CaMV 
Pararetroviruses are characterized by a non segmented double stranded DNA genome 
After entering the host cell nucleus  the viral DNA accumulates as a minichromosome   whose transcription is ensured by the host RNA polymerase II   
The CaMV genome consists in approximately   bp and encodes six viral gene products that have been detected in planta  Figure     
Viral proteins P  to P  are expressed from two major transcripts  namely a  S RNA  encoding P  and a  S RNA corresponding to the entire genome and serving as mRNA for proteins P –P    
Using the pre genomic  S RNA as a matrix  the protein P   product of gene V  reverse transcribes the genome into genomic DNA that is concomitantly encapsidated   The detection of CaMV recombinants in turnip hosts has been reported numerous times 
Some studies have demonstrated the appearance of infectious recombinant viral genomes after inoculation  i  of a host plant with two infectious or non infectious parental clones   or  ii  of a transgenic plant containing one CaMV transgene with a CaMV genome missing the corresponding genomic region   
While the former revealed inter genomic viral recombination  the latter demonstrated that CaMV can also recombine with transgenes within the host s genome 
Another study based on phylogenetic analyses of various CaMV strains has clearly suggested different origins for different genomic regions and  hence  multiple recombination events during the evolution of this virus   
Indirect experimental evidence has indicated that  in some cases  CaMV recombination could occur within the host nucleus  between different viral minichromosomes  presumably through the action of the DNA repair cellular machinery   
Nevertheless  the mechanism of  template switching  during reverse transcription  predominant in all retroviruses  most certainly also applies to pararetroviruses 
For this reason  and on the basis of numerous experimental data  CaMV is generally believed to recombine mostly in the cytoplasm of the host cell  by  legal  template switching between two pre genomic RNA molecules    or  illegal  template switching between the  S and the  S RNA   
Under this hypothesis  recombination in CaMV could therefore be considered as operating on a linear template during reverse transcription  with the  ′ and  ′ extremities later ligated to circularize the genomic DNA  position   in Figure  
The above cited studies clearly demonstrate that CaMV is able to recombine 
However  since these studies are based on complementation techniques  non quantitative detection  or phylogenetically based inferences of recombination  they do not inform us on whether recombination is an exceptional event or an  everyday  process shaping the genetic composition of CaMV populations In the present work  we aimed at answering this question 
To this end  we have constructed a CaMV genome with four genetic markers  demonstrated to be neutral in competition experiments 
By co inoculating host plants with equal amounts of wild type and marker containing CaMV particles  we have generated mixed populations in which impressive proportions of recombinants distributed in several different classes corresponding to exchange of different genomic regions have been detected and quantified 
Altogether  the recombinant genomes averaged over   of the population 
Further analysis of these data  assuming a number of viral replications during the infection period ranging from five to   indicates that the per nucleotide per replication cycle recombination rate of CaMV is of the same order of magnitude  i e  on the order of a few   across the entire genome 
We thereby provide the first quantification  to our knowledge  of the recombination rate in a virus population during a single passage in a single host From Figure   and supposing that all marker containing genomic regions can recombine  we could predict the detection and quantification of seven classes of recombinant genotypes   bcd a  a cd b  ab d c  abc d   cd ab  a d bc  and a c b d 
Indeed  all classes were detected  and their frequencies in the ten CaMV populations analyzed are summarized in Table  Altogether  the proportion of recombinant genomes found in the mixed viral populations was astonishingly high and very similar in the ten co infected plants analyzed  Table   last column  ranging between    plant   to    plants     and   with a mean frequency   standard error  of      
This result indicates that recombination events are very frequent during the invasion of the host plant by CaMV and represents  to our knowledge  the first direct quantification of viral recombination during the infection of a live multi cellular host The inferred per generation recombination and interference rates  assuming that CaMV undergoes ten replication cycles during the   d between infection and sampling  are given for each of the ten plants in Table  
Recombination rates between adjacent markers are large  on the order of   to  
Taking the distance in nucleotides between markers into account yields an average recombination rate per nucleotide and generation on the order of      
Interestingly  this recombination rate does not vary throughout the genome  Kruskal–Wallis test  p    To relax the assumption of the number of replications during the   d  we calculated the recombination parameters assuming five or   generations 
The effect of the number of generations on the estimates is linear  doubling the number of generations results in a halving of the recombination rate  detailed results not shown 
For example  the average recombination rates r
  r
  and r
  assuming   generations were equal to     and   respectively  compare with values in Table   yielding per nucleotide per generation recombination rates of             and      Inspection of Table   also shows that first order interference coefficients were in general negative  indicating that a crossing over in one genomic segment increases the probability that a crossing over will occur in another genomic segment  while the second order coefficient parameter had an average value close to zero with a large variance 
The mechanism leading to these results will be discussed in the following section One major breakthrough in the work presented here lies in the space and time scales at which the experiments were performed 
Indeed  the processes occurring within the course of a single infection of one multi cellular host are of obvious biological relevance for any disease 
Previous studies on viral recombination suffered from major drawbacks in this respect  basing their conclusions on experiments relying on complementation among non infectious viruses or between viruses with undetermined relative fitness  on phylogenetically based analyses  or on experiments in cell cultures 
For reasons detailed in the Introduction  the first two methods either do not provide information on the frequency of recombination  but only its occurrence  or address the question at a different temporal  and often spatial  scale 
Results from cell cultures  on the other hand  impose cell co infection by different viral variants  potentially overestimating the frequency of recombination events 
Our study circumvents these limitations by analyzing viral genotypes sampled from infected plants after the course of a single infection  and therefore the invasion and co infection of cells in various organs and tissues is very close to natural More than half of the genomes       see Table   present in a CaMV population after a single passage in its host plant were identified as recombinants  and these data allowed us to infer a per nucleotide per generation recombination rate on the order of       to      
The time length of one generation  i e  the time required for a given genome to go from one replication to the next  is totally unknown in plant viruses 
The only experimental data available on CaMV are based on the kinetics of gene expression in infected protoplasts  where the capsid protein is produced between   and   h   
The reverse transcription and the encapsidation of genomic DNA being two coupled phenomena    we judged it reasonable to assume a generation time of   d and  thus  an average of ten generations during our experiments 
In case this estimate is mistaken  we have verified a linear relationship between r and the number of generations  thereby allowing an immediate adjustment of r if the CaMV generation time is more precisely established 
At this point  we must consider that all cloned genomes may not have been through all the successive replication events potentially allowed by the timing of our experiments 
It was previously shown that about   of CaMV mature virus particles accumulate in compact inclusion bodies    where they may be sequestered for a long time  as such inclusions are very frequent in all infected cells  including those in leaves that have been invaded by the virus population for several weeks 
The viral population may thus present an age structure that could bias the estimation of the recombination rate 
In order to minimize this bias  the clones we analyzed were collected in one young newly formed leaf  where the chances of finding genomes from  unsequestered lines  were assumed to be higher 
In any case  our data analysis is conservative  since this age structure can only lead to an underestimation of the recombination rate Our results show that interferences between pairs of loci are negative  a recombination event between two loci apparently increases the probability of recombination between another pair of loci 
We believe that the most parsimonious explanation of these negative interferences is based on the way the infection builds up within plant hosts 
Indeed  one can divide infected host cells into those infected by a single virus genotype and those infected by more than one viral genotype 
In the former  analogous to clonal propagation  recombination is undetectable 
In the latter  recombination is not only detectable but  as our results indicate  very frequent 
Samples consisting of viruses resulting from a mixture of these two types of host cell infections will thus contain viruses with no recombination and viruses with several recombination events  thus yielding an impression of negative interference 
These conceptual arguments are supported by mathematical models 
It is indeed easy to show  detailed results not shown  that if a proportion F of the population reproduces clonally  analogous to single infections  while the remaining reproduces panmictically  negative interferences could be inferred even if they do not exist 
For example  assuming a three locus model with real recombination rates r
  and r
  and interference i
  the  apparent  recombination and interference parameters  would be r
        F r  r
        F r
  and i
     F   i
    F 
Interestingly  this example also shows that our estimates of the recombination rate are conservative  that a fraction F of host cells are singly infected while others are multiply infected leads to an underestimation of the recombination rate As judged by r
  r
  and r
  calculated between markers a–b  b–c  and c–d  respectively  we found evidence for recombination through the entire CaMV genome 
The values for r
 
r
  and r
  are remarkably similar  hence the recombination sites seem to be evenly distributed along the genome 
We considered the template switching model as the major way recombinants are created in CaMV 
As already mentioned in the Introduction  hot spots of template switching have been predicted at the position of the  ′ extremities of the  S and  S RNAs   
If other recombination mechanisms  such as that associated with second strand DNA synthesis or with the host cell DNA repair machinery  act significantly  hot spots would be expected at the positions of the sequence interruption     and     
Due to the design of our experiment and the position of the four markers  we have no information on putative hot spots at positions corresponding to the  ′ end of the  S RNA and to    at nucleotide position  
Nevertheless  the putative hot spots at the  ′ end of the  S RNA and at   and    nucleotide positions   and   respectively  fall between marker pairs c–d  b–c  and a–b  respectively 
Our results indicate that either these hot spots are quantitatively equivalent though predicted by different recombination mechanisms or  more likely  that they simply do not exist 
Whatever the explanation  what we observe is that the CaMV can exchange any portion of its genome  and thus any gene thereof  with an astonishingly high frequency during the course of a single host infection To our knowledge  the viral recombination rate has never previously been quantified experimentally for a plant virus   
In contrast  retroviruses and particularly HIV  have been extensively investigated in that sense 
As we have already discussed for these latter cases  the quantification of the intrinsic recombination rate was carried out in artificially co infected cell cultures 
The estimated intrinsic per nucleotide per generation recombination rate in HIV  is on the order of      less than one order of magnitude higher than our estimation for CaMV 
Because for various reasons detailed above we probably underestimate the within host CaMV recombination rate  we believe that the intrinsic recombination rate in CaMV is higher and perhaps on the order of that of HIV Other pararetroviruses such as plant badnaviruses or vertebrate hepadnaviruses have a similar cycle within their host cells  including steps of nuclear minichromosome  genomic size RNA synthesis  and reverse transcription and encapsidation 
Nevertheless  vertebrate hepadnaviruses  e g  hepatitis B virus  infect hosts that are very different from plants in their biology and physiology  and this could lead to a totally different frequency of cell co infection during the development of the virus populations 
Thus  even though our results can be informative for other pararetroviruses because of the viruses  shared biological characteristics  they should not be extrapolated to vertebrate pararetroviruses without caution We used the plasmid pCa  which is the complete genome of the CaMV isolate Cabb S  cloned into the pBR  plasmid at the unique SalI restriction site   
To analyze recombination in different regions of the genome  we introduced four genetic markers  a  b  c  and d  at the positions       and   respectively  thus approximately at four cardinal points of the CaMV circular double stranded DNA of   bp  Figure  
All markers  each corresponding to a single nucleotide change  were introduced by PCR directed mutagenesis in pCa  and resulted in the duplication of previously unique restriction sites BsiWI  PstI  MluI  and SacI in a plasmid designated pMark S  Because  in this study  we targeted the possible exchange of genes between viral genomes  all markers a  b  c  and d were introduced within coding regions corresponding to open reading frames I  IV  V  and VI  respectively 
Another important concern was to quantify recombination in the absence of selection  i e  to create neutral markers 
Consequently all markers consist of synonymous mutations  see below To generate the parental virus particles  plasmids pCa  and pMark S were mechanically inoculated into individual plants as previously described   
All plants were turnips  B  rapa cv   Just Right  grown under glasshouse conditions at   °C with a    light dark  photoperiod 
Thirty days post inoculation  all symptomatic leaves were harvested and viral particles were purified as described earlier   The resulting preparations of parental viruses  designated Cabb S and Mark S  were quantified by spectrometry using the formula described by Hull et al 
  
We fixed the initial frequency of markers to a value of   and a solution containing   mg ml of virus particles of both Cabb S and Mark S at a   ratio was prepared 
Plantlets were co infected by mechanical inoculation of two to three leaves with   μl of this virus solution  using abrasive Celite AFA  Fluka  Ronkonkoma  New York  United States 
The mixed CaMV population was allowed to grow during   d of systemic infection We designed an experimental protocol for quantifying marker frequency within a mixed Cabb S Mark S virus population after a single passage in a host plant 
Twenty four individual plants  inoculated as above with equal amounts of Cabb S and Mark S  were harvested   d post inoculation  when symptoms were fully developed 
The viral DNA was purified from   mg of young newly formed infected leaves according to the protocol described previously   
After the precipitation step of this protocol  the viral DNA was resuspended and further purified with the Wizard DNA clean up kit  Promega  Fitchburg  Wisconsin  United States  in TE  X   mM Tris HCl and   mM EDTA  pH   
Aliquots of viral DNA preparations were digested by restriction enzymes corresponding either to marker a  b  c  or d and submitted to a   agarose gel electrophoresis  colored by ethydium bromide and exposed to UV 
Each individual restriction enzyme cut once in Cabb S DNA and twice in Mark S  thus generating DNA fragments of different sizes attributable to one or the other in the mixed population of CaMV genomes 
After scanning the agarose gels  we estimated the relative frequency of the two genotypes in each viral DNA preparation and at each marker position  by densitometry using the NIH   Image program 
The statistical analyses of the frequency of the four markers are described below To identify and quantify the recombinants within the CaMV mixed populations  aliquots from ten of the   viral DNA preparations described above were digested by the restriction enzyme SalI  and directly cloned into pUC  at the corresponding site 
In each of the ten viral populations analyzed    full genome length clones were digested separately by BsiWI  PstI  MluI  and SacI  to test for the presence of marker a  b  c  and d  respectively 
In this experiment  with the marker representing an additional restriction site  we could easily distinguish between the Cabb S and the Mark S genotype at all four marker positions  upon agarose gel   electrophoresis of the digested clones 
Clones with none or all four markers were parental genotypes  whereas clones harboring     or   markers were clearly recombinants 
Due to the very high number of recombinants detected  markers eventually appearing or disappearing due to spontaneous mutations were neglected Here we present the different methods we used to quantify recombination in the CaMV genome 
Because all these methods assume that the different markers are neutral  we first discuss assumption We used two datasets to test the neutrality of markers  both resulting from plants co infected with a   ratio of Mark S and Cabb S 
The first consisted of viral DNA densitometry data derived from   plants  described above  where for each plant we have an estimate of the frequency of each marker in the genome population 
The second consisted of the restriction of   individual full genome length viral clones obtained from one co infected plant  described above  yielding an estimate of the frequency of each marker  and this was repeated on ten different plants 
The frequencies of the different markers were       and   for markers a  b  c  and d in the first dataset and       and   in the second dataset 
We tested whether these frequencies were significantly different from the expected value under neutrality    using either t tests  for datasets where normality could not be rejected  seven out of eight cases  or Wilcoxon signed rank non parametric tests otherwise  marker c in the first dataset 
In all cases p values were larger than  There are several cautionary remarks regarding these analyses 
First  in all cases we found an excess of markers 
Unfortunately  the two datasets cannot be regarded as independent because  even though the methods through which the frequency estimates were obtained were different  the plants used in the second dataset were a subset of the plants of the first 
We thus have only four independent estimates in each case  and there is minimal power to detect significant deviations from neutrality with such a small sample size 
It should be noted at this stage that deviations from the expected value could also be caused either by slight deviations from the   ratio in the infecting mixed solution  or by deviations from that ratio in the frequency of the viral particles that actually get into the plants 
Second  because of the relatively small sample sizes and low statistical power  the tests presented above could have detected only large deviations The results clearly show  however  precisely that the markers do not have large effects  if any  and that therefore recombination estimates would be affected only very slightly by any hypothetical selective effects of the markers 
Because of this  along with the fact that the introduced markers provoke silent substitutions in the CaMV genome  we assumed that markers were effectively neutral in the rest of the analysis The dataset used to estimate the recombination frequency consisted of the   full genome length viral clones   from each of ten co infected plants  individually genotyped for each of the four markers 
As discussed in detail in the Results  recombination was very frequent and concerned all four markers 
Indeed  approximately half of the genotyped clones exhibited a recombinant genotype 
It was therefore meaningful to try to obtain quantitative estimates of recombination from our data Our aim was to analyze viral recombination in a live host 
Consequently  we had to deal with the fact that more than one viral replication cycle occurred during the   d that infection lasted in our experiment  we had to wait that long for the disease to develop and to be able to recover sufficient amounts of viral DNA from each infection 
Based on the kinetics of gene expression    we postulate that each replication cycle lasts between   and   d  and that therefore seven to ten cycles occurred between infection and the sampling time 
In case this assumption is incorrect  we did calculations assuming five  seven  ten  or   replication cycles during these   d  As shown  the results were not affected qualitatively  and only slightly quantitatively 
It is important to note that we assumed that recombination occurred through a template switching mechanism  and that therefore  from a recombination point of view  the CaMV genome is linear 
The reverse transcription starts and finishes at the position   in Figure   which is the point of circularization of the DNA genome 
This implies that changes between contiguous markers a–b  b–c  and c–d can be considered as true recombination whereas those between a and d cannot  as they may simply stem from circularization of DNA  during the synthesis of which the polymerase has switched template once anywhere between a–b  b–c  or c–d To estimate the recombination rate between markers  we wrote recurrence equations describing the change in frequency of each genotype over one generation  assuming random mating and no selection  i e  the standard Wright–Fisher population genetics model 
We then expressed the frequency of all possible genotypes n generations later as a function of their initial frequency and of the recombination parameters 
Subsequently we calculated the maximum likelihood estimates of the recombination parameters and their asymptotic variances given initial frequencies  we assumed that the two  parental  genotypes  Mark S and Cabb S  had equal initial frequencies of   and that all other genotypes had initial frequencies of zero  and frequencies after n generations  the observed frequencies  as stated above we used different values of n 
All algebraic and numerical calculations were carried out with the software Mathematica The recombination parameters are the recombination rates between two adjacent loci  e g  r
  for the recombination rate between markers a and b  and the interference coefficients  e g  i
  for interference between recombination events in the segments between markers a and b and b and c  To define these parameters we followed Christiansen    and in particular the recombination distributions for two  three  and four loci  respectively  Tables     and   of   
It is important to realize that given the definitions of these parameters  the estimator of the recombination rate between two loci is not affected by the number of loci considered 
In other words  we obtain the same estimation of the recombination rate between markers a and b whether we consider genotypic frequencies at just these two loci  or the frequencies at these two loci plus a third locus  or the complete information to which we have access  the four marker genotypes 
Information on additional loci only affects the estimates of the interference coefficients It proved impossible to carry out the calculations for four loci algebraically 
Instead  we used a computer program to calculate the expected genotypic frequencies at all four loci after n generations  given the above stated initial frequencies and specified recombination parameters 
For each combination of recombination parameters we calculated a Euclidean distance between the vector of the expected genotypic frequencies and the observed genotypic frequencies  and considered that the estimated recombination parameters were those yielding the minimal Euclidean distance 
In all cases  the estimated recombination rates between pairs of loci were equal to the second decimal to those estimated algebraically from data for three or two loci Tumor Restrictions to Oncolytic VirusIn most solid tumors the tumor interior displays a high cellular density with multiple cell types  both malignant and normal  stromal  cells  interdigitated by strands of extracellular matrix  ECM  and other poorly defined tissue 
Stromal cells typically consist of fibroblasts  macrophages  neutrophils and other immune cell types 
Tumor associated fibroblasts are a source of the bulk acellular tissue in tumors    which is largely made up of polysugars and glycoproteins  such as collagens  laminins  fibronectins  proteoglycans  hyaluronan and water  forming a dense matrix around and between the cancer cells   
This matrix provides structural support but also haptotactic and chemotactic guidance for cancer cells   
Moreover  the prevailing tumor interstitium is rich in soluble angiogenic factors  such as members of the vascular endothelial growth factor  VEGF  family    cellular growth factors  including endothelial growth factor  EGF  basic fibroblast growth factor  FGF  platelet derived growth factor  PDGF  and pleiotrophic factors  particularly transforming growth factor  TGF  beta   
Additionally  both tumor  and stromal cells secrete cytokines and chemokines  such as interleukin  IL    IL   tumor necrosis factor  TNF  alpha  stromal cell derived factor  SDF    macrophage migration inhibitory factor  MIF    which on one hand recruit more stromal and progenitor cells into the tumors and on the other hand curb the activity of antigen presenting cells and anti tumor T cells   
In several independent cancer types  high serum levels of IL   and IL   are indicators of poor prognosis   Aberrant tumor and stromal growth combined with an overproduction of matrix leads to high interstitial pressure in the tumor  preventing lateral diffusion of therapeutic compounds within the tumor 
Tight cellular compactness combined with a high tumor proliferation rate also causes physical crowding and puts constraints on oxygenation  which due to aberrant angiogenesis and rupture of the haphazard vessels is mostly incomplete and results in chronic tissue hypoxia toward the tumor cores 
As cancer cells exist in a crowding hypoxic  and cytokine growth factor perpetuated chronic state of stress  they upregulate a number of key cellular molecules that function as a collective defense against a wide range of therapies  including oncolytic viruses 
The properties of oncolytic viruses and their status in clinical development as well as various delivery options have been reviewed elsewhere   
In this review  we provide an overview of two of the main intratumoral barriers to oncolytic virus spread  the extracellular tumor make up and the intracellular antiviral defense mechanisms Tumor cellular structure and composition may in concert with abundant extracellular matrix  ECM  deposition pose a severe hurdle for systemic virus entry and propagation of infection within the tumor 
The extracellular matrix is a complex dense network consisting of multiple proteins  glycoproteins and polysaccharides including collagens  laminins  fibronectins  proteoglycans and hyaluronic acid   
The interstitial fluid pressure  IFP  in the tumor surrounding blood and lymphatic vessels is mainly created by the high cell density that forms an increased physical pressure outwards and does not allow free diffusion of therapeutics   
A high IFP generally predicts an aggressive tumor phenotype as tumor cells tend to escape from tumor margins where the pressure drops  thus facilitating spread of metastatic cells   
On the other hand  for therapeutic virus  interstitial fluid concentration gradients may pose a hurdle as passive diffusion in viable regions  typically the rim  may occur mainly outward   
Given the limited arsenal of known chemicals alleviating tumor compactness and the poor penetration drugs in general into the tumor tissue  this is a considerable problem that may not be easy to tackle 
Some strategies are discussed below Viruses are passive particles and rely either on radial cell to cell spread or on soluble diffusion across concentration gradients to reach their target cells and to propagate the infection 
Tumor matrix is critical in this regard  as it can block both forms of spread 
Passively diffusing viruses may physically not fit through the strands of the ECM 
This was shown for oncolytic herpes virus  which has an outer diameter of over   nm  and whose spreading could be improved by matrix degrading bacterial collagenase co injection   
Bilbao and coworkers showed that adenovirus entry into experimental hepatocellular carcinoma nodules in the livers of immunocompetent rats following intravenous or intraportal injection was directly related to the thickness of the ECM capsule enveloping the nodules   
On the other hand  we found using Semliki Forest virus  which has an outer diameter of about   nm  that even upon intratumoral injection spread was blocked by ECM  which formed a physical barrier for virus infection  Figure  The foremost option to reduce interstitial fluid pressure and to remove physical molecule barriers imposed by the ECM is to use matrix degrading enzymes 
These act by digesting collagen  fibrin  and other types of fibrillar matrix deposits  creating more space between cell clusters  and glycosaminoglycan polymers  known to limit fluid movement in tumors 
Simultaneously  such strategies may also expose more cell surface to viruses  increasing the likelihood of infection 
In a study by Kuriyama  trypsin or collagenase dispase was injected into subcutaneous U  and U  glioma xenografts in immunocompromised mice  followed by a reporter adenovirus   
Both types of ECM degrading enzymes increased tumor transduction by the virus  but when doses got too high  transduction efficacy suffered  demonstrating a balance between ECM degradation and oncolytic virus efficacy 
In another study  treatment of PC  tumors with vaccinia virus producing matrix metalloprotease  MMP    resulted in reduction of collagen IV fibrils and increase in virus penetration into tumor  which yielded elevated virus titers   
Hong et al 
targeted orthotopic neuroblastoma xenografts engineered to express MMP  with oncolytic HSV  achieving increased virus distribution compared to control tumors   
Similar results were obtained when human soft tissue sarcoma HSTS T overexpressing MMP  or MMP  were injected with oncolytic HSV   
MMP expressing tumors contained significantly less sulfated glycosaminoglycans compared to control tumors 
Other enzymes and protein effectors  either engineered into virus expression cassettes or provided exogenously  include hyaluronidase  decorin  various other MMPs  and notably relaxin a peptide hormone normally expressed during particular phase of pregnancy that does not possess tissue degrading activity itself  but instead induces a number of key collagen degrading proteases seemingly in a tumor specific manner   
Beyer showed that relaxin expressed by murine stem cells improved trastuzumab penetrance and therapy outcome in syngeneic tumor models   
In another study  chimeric adenovirus Ad  expressing relaxin showed increased tumor transduction and virus dissemination   Several other strategies to increase penetration of therapeutics in tumors have been developed   
While the stromal ECM capsule of tumor nodules acts as a physical barrier to virus entry following intravenous injection  it was possible to improve tumor infection by administering vaso active compounds  angiotensin II  histamine  nitroglycerine  before the virus   
This is interesting  as vasculature per se would not be expected to alter or influence the physical composition of the ECM  such as collagen strand thickness 
Instead  virus access to the tumor was improved  most likely by increased access from the blood via tumor stromal adjoining vessels 
Interestingly  in a study with oncolytic herpes virus  anti VEGF monoclonal antibody Bevacizumab given before intravenous virus injection gave poorer anti tumor efficacy than when given after the virus   
The study showed that while HSV is able to enter and infect tumors better through their leaky vasculature compared to Bevacizumab normalized vasculature  vascular normalization by Bevacizumab still gave superior combination efficacy when the virus was already in the tumor 
This effect was likely dependent on altering both physical and biological properties of the tumor  including interstitial pressure and oxygenation 
In another study  anti VEGF A antibody injections in nude mice harboring U  human glioma xenografts led to an increase in MMP  expression and reduction in collagen fiber content  facilitating improved distribution of oncolytic adenovirus within the tumor tissue   
In general  targeting tumor vasculature by oncolytic viruses and including agents that affect tumor vasculature in combination regimens is gaining interest    and it will be interesting to see more specific studies on how vascular acting agents may affect the physical barriers to oncolytic viruses Some viruses do not need an extracellular step for propagating infection  such as members of the herpes and poxvirus families  and may be able to spread from cell to cell 
For example  HSV  is able to infect neighboring cells via lateral tight junctions in a manner dependent on its glycoproteins E and I   
Vaccinia virus  on the other hand  induces so called actin tails  which are actin filament driven membranous protrusions of the plasma membrane harboring a single virus particle at the outer tip 
These actin tails actively deliver and deposit virus particles onto or even into neighboring cells   
Because lateral spread without an extracellular step may circumvent neutralizing immunity as well as some of the physical obstacles the tumor microenvironment imposes  this ability has been engineered into viruses that normally do not possess it 
A promising strategy is to engineer OVs to express membrane fusogenic genes  MFGs  such as gibbon ape leukemia virus  GALV  glycoprotein  reptilian reovirus p  protein  FAST  or the membrane glycoproteins H and F of measles virus   
Quite intriguingly  expression of several different MFGs by oncolytic adenovirus synergized with chemotherapy in anti tumor efficacy both in vitro and in vivo    suggesting that membrane fusion facilitated lateral spread of also chemotherapeutics  which otherwise would not have occurred in a compact tumor 
The potential limitation of cell to cell dependent spread  however  may be that membrane free physical barriers  such as the ECM  may still pose a barrier to spread 
Also  it is unclear whether MFGs or other mechanisms of lateral spread may assist in reaching distant tumor nests Some other strategies to alleviate matrix imposed restrictions to oncolytic viruses have been discussed elsewhere   Tumors of epithelial origin mostly retain the firm cellular integrity seen in their original adhesive intercellular configuration 
Several viruses use cellular receptors which are located in paracellular tight junctions  which may be problematic in tightly packed tumors   
Adenovirus C group viruses use coxsackie adenovirus receptor  CAR  as their primary entry point  whereas adenovirus B  group members and measles virus Edmonston use CD  complement binding molecule as their cellular receptor   
Adenovirus B  group  serotypes       and   entry occurs using desmoglein   DSG    
Of these  CAR and DSG  are preferentially located within tight junctions and are hidden from virus binding   
Also the complement receptor CD  was ascribed a role in maintenance of epithelial cell integrity by interactions with the E cadherin catenin network   
These observations imply that before reaching the potential entry site on the tumor cell the virus must find its way into the junctional space 
Moreover  it has become increasingly clear that for example glioma tumors traditionally targeted by Ad  serotype adenoviruses often express only low levels of CAR and instead much higher levels of CD    Beyond that tight junctions hide multiple virus receptors  they contain a network of adhesion molecules  including ZO  cadherins  claudins and occludin  which  if perturbed  is associated with more aggressive disease in many types of cancer   
Since tight junctions also contain important receptors that mediate tumor promoting signaling and which have been targeted by monoclonal antibodies  notably Her  it would be highly useful to develop strategies that temporarily loosen the tight junction contacts even at cost of a transient increase in tumor metastatic risk 
One of the most interesting approaches has been to exploit the natural propensity of adenovirus serotype   which as part of its natural life cycle creates dodecahedral particles  PtDd  consisting of viral capsid proteins  penton base and fiber that open tight junctions by binding to and dissolving desmoglein  dimers and reducing E cadherin expression  to develop a specific tight junction opening molecule  JO    
Adenovirus type   uses PtDds to promote its own infection  opening the tight junctions ahead of infection to maximize access to desmoglein 
Analogously  when administered to human tumor xenografts  JO  facilitated penetration of trastuzumab much deeper into the tumor tissue than when the monoclonal antibody was administered on its own   
Moreover  JO  synergized with several chemotherapeutics in solid tumor models   
Backed by our own findings with oncolytic SFV  showing that both extracellular matrix and tumor cell compactness restrict virus spread and oncolytic efficacy  we believe combination approaches that target both tight junctions and extracellular matrix will prove effective in future virotherapy development  Figure  An alternative approach to increasing tumor penetration by oncolytic viruses is to alter tumor cell morphology and status 
Notably  cell death and in particular the type of cell death induced by virus has been shown to affect virus distribution within a tumor mass  in a study by Nagano et al  administration of apoptosis inducing paclitaxel before injecting oncolytic herpes simplex virus increased virus dissemination in the tumor  allowing its diffuse in  tunnels  created by shrinking dying tumor cells   Maintenance of physiological adherence is essential for proper ECM function and for retaining cellular integrity 
Therefore  a potential caveat of using ECM degrading proteolytic enzymes or tight junction openers is the risk of neoplastic cell detachment from the tumor ECM and increased risk of metastasis 
While ECM degradation or tight junction opening may operate innocuously  there is also a chance that loss of E cadherins via proteases or via non specific deregulation of tight junction integrity during ECM modulating therapy could trigger pro tumorigenic Wnt β catenin signaling  possibly driving epithelial to mesenchymal transition   
One study showed that ectopic relaxin expression stimulated MMP expression and enhanced breast cancer invasiveness    whereas another paper found short term relaxin exposure to increase breast cancer cell motility whereas long term expression reduced both motility and cancer invasiveness   
In the context of oncolytic viruses  Lavilla Alonso tested several proteases  including hyaluronidase  relaxin  and macrophage metalloelastase  and showed they all could assist adenovirus entry into tumors  yet  the authors did not detect treatment induced metastases or increase in tumor invasiveness   
Another strategy possibly balancing some of the putative risks of tight junction disruption could be to use Wnt dependent oncolytic viruses   Tumors are invariably fenestrated by host fibroblasts  myeloid cells and other non transformed cells  which driven by cancer induced cues can adopt various reprogrammed phenotypes to promote tumor angiogenesis and growth and to alter tumor responses to therapies   
As most of them normally play a role in immune homeostasis and pathogen sensing  they also respond to and influence oncolytic virus infection of tumors Fulci et al 
reported that injection of oncolytic HSV  directly into glioblastoma tumor parenchyma triggered upregulation of CD  and CD  monocytic markers and rapid clearance of virus  likely executed by infiltrating phagocytic cells   
When clodronate liposomes were used to deplete macrophages in vivo  the authors observed a  fold increase in virus titers in the brain tumors concomitant with an   reduction in peripheral CD  macrophages in animal spleens  suggesting that CD  cells migrate into the tumors upon virus injection and limit overall oncolytic efficacy 
While CD  cells were not reduced by peripheral macrophage depletion  arguing that these cells had been recruited to the tumors before the treatment  they could be eliminated in live glioma slices ex vivo  resulting in a  fold increase in virus replication 
Macrophages may secrete antiviral type I interferon constitutively at very low  subnanomolar  levels   and recently Liu et al 
showed that tumor resident CD  macrophages induced a protective antiviral state in ovarian and breast tumors which led to resistance to oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus  VSV  infection   
Type I IFN signaling  JAK  inhibitor Ruxolitinib reversed the resistance  facilitating VSV replication in the macrophage protected cancer cells 
It is tempting to speculate that tumor resident macrophages also rendered syngeneic GL  and DBT mouse gliomas completely refractory to VA  oncolytic alphavirus  as these cells were quite infectable in vitro and live glioma slices regained their sensitivity to virus within   h  indicating dilution of IFN I   Macrophages or the closely related myeloid suppressor cells are the predominant stromal cell type in many tumors and are actively recruited during cancer progression   
Heavy macrophage presence in the tumors indicates that such tumors may be resistant to oncolytic virotherapy  unless depleting preconditioning would be used 
Moreover  as part of the early immune response to virus infection  monocytic cells are rapidly recruited to tumors following intratumoral virus injection 
In one study  depletion of either CD b  cells or VEGF secreted by these cells in mice treated with oncolytic HSV  greatly increased oncolytic efficacy  tentatively linking pro tumorigenic and antiviral angiogenic mechanisms   Another key pro tumorigenic signaling employed by many tumors is up regulation of CXCR  the receptor for chemokine CXCL   also known as SDF  and recruitment of stromal cells expressing CXCL  which maintain the tumor and recruit additional cells to support tumor expansion and invasion  such as endothelial cell progenitors which contribute to neovascularization   
Indeed  high CXCR  expression is a negative prognostic factor for many cancers 
Oncolytic vaccinia virus engineered to express a soluble antagonist of CXCR  showed improved intratumoral virus replication  increased vascular disruption and a markedly reduced infiltration of the tumors by putative immune suppressive and tumor promoting stromal cells   
This study highlights how reducing pro tumor stromal cell effects may alleviate antiviral resistance and yield increased overall therapeutic efficacy 
On the other hand  if the paracrine antiviral effects of tumor homing monocytic cells could be selectively abrogated these cells could favorably be used to ferry oncolytic viruses into tumors 
Indeed  a significant delay in metastatic tumor potential was achieved when macrophages were harnessed to deliver a tumor specific oncolytic adenovirus   What is the antiviral status in human cancer 
Recent analyses from different normal cells that occupy the same organ reveal striking functional variation in components of the type I IFN signaling pathway that correlate with the tissue tropism and virulence of some virus strains   
Can similar variation in such components be found in cancer cells  or do cancer cells make an exception Transformed cells undergo selective elimination by the immune system before becoming cancerous  termed immunoediting  based on observations of differential capacity of immunocompetent mice to reject tumors previously grown in immunocompromised hosts versus syngeneic animals   
Cancer cell responsiveness to type I and type II IFNs plays a role during immunoediting  cancer cells that eventually progress to form a tumor display reduced capacity to respond to IFN gamma  which otherwise would upregulate MHC class I molecules and render the tumors amenable to CD  T cell mediated destruction  whereas responsiveness to type I interferon initially helps tumors avoid immune purging during the editing phase and is then irrelevant   
Of note  the anti tumor effects of type I IFN  still exploited today in several cancers  were shown to depend on host NK cells  and mice in which IFNAR was blocked by monoclonal antibody failed to reject even highly immunogenic tumors  as opposed to mice treated with control antibody  who all rejected the immunogenic tumor challenge   
Thus  whereas tumor responsiveness to type I IFN is not predetermined after immunoediting  other factors post immunoediting may influence it In several tumor types  varying levels of expression of components of the type I IFN signaling cascade have been detected  and in some tumor types these components have been found to have prognostic value  whereas in others they do not seem to influence survival   
However  emerging data suggests that antiviral genes may predict poor survival because they increase treatment resistance 
In one study  poor prognosis of several types of cancer due to genotoxic treatment resistance was found to correlate with increased activity of IFN I pathway genes   
In this study  a triad of type I IFN signaling pathway genes  STAT  ISG  and IFIT  formed a pan tumor type negative prognostic factor  and a broader seven gene cluster established negative prognostic criteria for treatment resistant breast cancer 
Treatment resistance was subsequently shown to depend on STAT  signaling  STAT expressing tumor clones were positively selected in animals in vivo  demonstrating increased proliferation and metastatic potential  and STAT expression mediated resistance against genotoxic assault by doxorubicin or ionizing radiation  knockdown of STAT  resulted in lower proliferation rate and metastatic capacity and increased sensitivity to genotoxic stress    
In another study  resistance to epigenetic DNA modifiers  AZA dC  a methyltransferase inhibitor  and LBH  or MGCD  both histone deacetylase  HDAC  inhibitors  was correlated with increased expression of IFN I pathway genes in small lung cancer cells   
Basal IFN related gene expression in several different SML cell lines was upregulated Interestingly  in many cancers  STAT proteins are not phosphorylated and persist in unphosphorylated form  U STAT 
Like its phosphorylated counterpart  U STAT  increases expression of genes contributing to resistance to DNA damaging agents   
While it is currently unknown why cancers may prefer to use unphosphorylated forms  it is known that U STATs activate distinct signals compared to their phosphorylated counterparts 
However  importantly for oncolytic viruses  in many tumors  constant expression and release of type I IFN leads to a constitutively high level of unphosphorylated forms of STAT  STAT  and IRF  which together form an unphosphorylated but functional ISGF like complex that relocalizes to the nucleus and drives expression of a specific set of ISGs distinct from acute IFN I exposure   
These ISGs are sufficient to maintain a functional antiviral defense and they play a critical role in resistance to DNA damaging agents On a cellular level  virus replication is controlled by antiviral defense molecules    which in turn are primarily controlled by type I IFN signaling 
In addition to classical type I IFN  or cytokine induced antiviral signaling  tumors may employ other antiviral defense mechanisms 
For example  stromal cells may secrete peptides with antiviral properties called defensins   
The defensins are amphiphatic and typically  –  amino acids in length and interfere with viruses by physically binding to and disrupting virus particles and or by inducing antiviral responses in target cells via pattern recognition receptors 
At least oral squamous cell carcinomas were found to overexpress defensins compared to normal control tissues   
While the role of defensins in oncolytic virus infection of tumors is unclear  one study showed that the immune stimulating properties of defensins may be exploited to increase overall therapeutic efficacy 
In this study  expression of beta   defensin from a conditionally replicating adenovirus yielded a superior therapeutic entity compared to the unarmed parental virus via enhanced anti tumor immune responses mediated by TLR dependent activation of dendritic cells   In summary  human cancers display varying degrees of expression of antiviral proteins or their signaling regulators at baseline 
Some of these may increase in response to genotoxic anti cancer treatments 
In the next chapter we will highlight some of the consequences to oncolytic virotherapy of the heterogeneity in type I IFN responsiveness in tumor cells All oncolytic viruses tested to date display variable infectivity in different cancer cell lines 
This variability is likely at least partly dependent on type I IFN as most oncolytic viruses are IFN sensitive 
IFN secretion follows virus sensing by the cells via Toll like receptors expressed on both the plasma membrane and in endocytotic vesicles  NOD like receptors  STING  AIM  NLP inflammosome and other danger sensing molecules  summarized elsewhere   
While all viruses carry an arsenal of counteracting molecules    no virus goes completely undetected 
Even HSV amplicons  which are devoid of functional virus genes  induce a type I IFN response that mediates a STAT dependent system wide antiviral defense in mice within one hour of intravenous vector injection  resulting in significant reduction of transgene expression compared to expression in STAT  knockout animals   During our own studies with attenuated SFV vector VA  it became apparent that the dramatic and lasting therapeutic efficacy achieved following mere single intravenous  or intratumoral  injection of the virus in immunocompromised mice bearing human A  melanoma or U  glioma xenografts   was not going to be recapitulated easily in immunocompetent animals   
The paradox in our studies was that while oncolytic SFV vector VA  effectively replicated in and destroyed a variety of IFN responsive cancer cell lines in vitro  it consistently failed to eradicate tumors generated from the same cell types in vivo  even if large doses of virus were injected directly into the tumor mass and even if the tumors were void of visible physical barriers  Figure  
Conversely  only tumors generated from IFN unresponsive cancer cells have seemed infectable in vivo by VA  so far 
In light of earlier findings by others  showing that type I IFN receptor knockout mice are highly susceptible to SFV infection and quickly succumb to multi organ systemic infection    the parameters for oncolytic SFV efficacy seem clear  tumor cells must be defective in type I IFN response for the virus to be effective These findings are in line with emerging data from other groups  showing a remarkably strict dependence of oncolytic virus replication on defective type I IFN responsiveness  a dogma introduced at the turn of the  st century   
For example  sarcomas and melanomas display differing permissiveness to oncolytic VSV  an obstacle which may be overcome by blocking type I IFN signaling   
In eight sarcoma cell lines  basal up regulation of RIG I and IFIT  and rapid induction of STAT  phosphorylation upon IFN I treatment correlated with resistance to oncolytic measles virus   
In other studies  human pancreatic and ovarian cancer cells display resistance against Rb dependent oncolytic adenovirus  strongly correlating with intracellular levels of MxA  and acquired resistance to repeated oncolytic adenovirus injections in an intraperitoneal ovarian carcinoma model was associated with an increase in MxA as well as several other key ISGs in the tumors   
A study comparing normal human or mouse melanocytes to a panel of melanoma cells revealed strong correlation between permissiveness to oncolytic VSV and capacity to mount antiviral defense in response to type I IFN   
In this study  VSV rp  harboring two mutations in P and L genes  was superior to several other tested oncolytic VSV strains  but the dependence on defective IFN responsiveness was still retained 
In yet another study  oncolytic VSV replicated in four out of twelve mesothelioma cell lines which were unable to mount antiviral defense upon IFN beta pretreatment or to respond to infection by up regulation of PKR  MxA or  OAS mRNA   
In contrast  the non permissive mesothelioma cells mounted antiviral defense  associated with PKR  MxA or  OAS mRNA up regulation  in response to infection or to exogenous type I IFN 
The authors of this study further linked the observed pattern of virus resistance to clinical mesothelioma samples  where in a mesothelioma tissue array  significant variance in immunoreactivity against PKR  p  and or IFNAR was observed  with only a few samples displaying lack of reactivity against all three components  arguing that most tumors in clinical settings would display at least some level of resistance to oncolytic VSV Oncolytic adenoviruses are often deleted for E A  which normally binds Rb and prevents it from sequestering E F  which results in the viruses being unable to replicate in normal cells 
However  since adenovirus  as with all viruses  contains elements that antagonize antiviral defenses  such elements have also been targets for deletion to render the virus sensitive to innate antiviral defenses  which would be expected to remain intact only in normal cells 
Cancer cells expressing Ras may down regulate protein kinase R and inhibit type I IFN induction by interfering with RIG I signaling   
Also  select interferon stimulated genes appear to be repressed by the Ras MEK ERK signaling cascade   
PKR activation shuts down E F dependent translation  including translation of virus messenger RNAs 
Therefore  an adenovirus deleted for VA RNA  which antagonizes PKR  should be capable of replicating in Ras overexpressing  tumor  cells 
However  while this was seemingly the case    it was later discovered that Ras is not an obligatory determinant for PKR inactivation and that virus replication was halted even in Ras overexpressing cells via functional PKR mediated E F phosphorylation  implying that the parameters of VA RNA deleted adenovirus replication had to be revised   
Similar findings were obtained with oncolytic reovirus  against which Ras independent tumor resistance emerged in vivo   
Thus  under some circumstances even tumor cells over expressing Ras may respond to type I IFN or to stimulants of pattern recognition receptors  activating PKR and inhibiting virus translation 
To complicate matters  MEK inhibitors have been shown restore antiviral signaling capacity in Ras overexpressing tumors   
This implies that human tumors treated with MEK inhibitors  such as Trametinib which was recently approved for treatment of BRAF mutated melanoma  may be poor targets for oncolytic viruses as antiviral signaling capacity in such tumors may be restored Some oncolytic viruses  such as members of the poxvirus family  are seemingly resistant to the antiviral effects of type I IFNs in vitro and may be controlled by other cellular factors   
However  in most cases  sensitivity or resistance to type I IFN is assessed in vitro and using only one cytokine  which may mask synergies with other factors present in vivo 
One possible explanation for the in vitro–in vivo discrepancy is the tumor micro environment  which not only imposes physical barriers to oncolytic viruses but also alters intracellular antiviral defenses 
For example  glioma cells were found in the brain to spontaneously secrete type I IFN  which conferred resistance against oncolytic HSV 
Resistance was linked to ECM protein CCN  interaction with glioma cell surface receptor alpha   beta   integrin  which activated interferon secretion   
It is tempting to speculate whether this or a similar ECM glioma interaction could have contributed to the resistance of syngeneic glioma cells we observed in vivo but not in vitro to both oncolytic SFV and vaccinia virus  FIG    
Also  while critical in many respects  antiviral signaling may occur without signaling via type I IFN receptor  IFNAR 
For instance  upon infection of IFNAR KO mice with murine hepatitis virus  MHV  brain cells were found to have upregulated antiviral GTPase TGTP and IFITm  and IFITm  all of which have confirmed antiviral activity in vivo against a variety of viruses   
In these cases  IFN gamma and TNF alpha likely account for at least part of the observed ISG activity  where e g  TGTP is upregulated by IFN γ signaling and TNFα has been shown to induce ISG  independently of IFNAR   Interestingly  while most cancers are heterogeneous in antiviral defence signaling  one broad class of tumors in particular may display consistently low capacity to ward off oncolytic viruses  oncovirus induced cancers 
This is because oncoviruses  as all viruses  carry a complement of factors that abrogate antiviral sensors and effectors  which may result in tumors that are uniformly devoid of antiviral signaling 
In an intriguing study  oncolytic VSV infected and destroyed human papilloma virus  HPV positive cervical carcinoma cells more effectively than HPV negative head  and neck cancer cells due to HPV E mediated suppression of antiviral signaling   
HPV positive or E expressing xenografts were efficiently eradicated from nude mice following VSV injection 
The potential of this approach is that even oncolytic viruses that are extremely sensitive to type I IFN  such as attenuated SFV or M mutated VSV  may function well against oncovirus induced cancers where the oncovirus machinery ensures the lack of antiviral defense While on first thought it would appear counterintuitive to antagonize the very factors that keep oncolytic viruses tumor specific  emerging data shows that this can be accomplished in a safe way 
One of the foremost strategies to increase oncolytic virus efficacy is to combine them with drugs that lower tumor antiviral defenses 
In this regard  a primary target for interference is the prototypical type I IFN signaling cascade 
While small molecular inhibitors against IFNAR are not available  activity of downstream signaling transducers may effectively be blocked 
Human pancreatic cancer cells were shown to constitutively express high levels of MxA and OAS and to mount type I IFN dependent resistance to oncolytic VSV 
Resistance could be overcome by blocking activity of IFNAR associated Janus kinase  JAK      
Similarly  JAK  inhibitor ruxolitinib overcame type I IFN dependent resistance of human SCC  head and neck cancer cells against oncolytic VSV   
Ruxolitinib also successfully abrogated type I IFN mediated antiviral effects elicited by macrophages    highlighting that this drug might also alleviate type I IFN dependent tumor resistance to oncolytic viruses imposed by stromal cells 
However  the obvious downside to using JAK inhibitors is their effects on critical host defense mechanisms  which may result in increased infection of normal cells 
Moreover  JAK inhibitors may reduce anti tumor immune responses elicited by oncolytic virotherapy 
For example  ruxolitinib was shown to impair the capacity of dendritic cells promote CD  T cell responses against model tumor antigens   
On the other hand  in this study clearance of adenovirus was delayed in ruxolitinib treated normal animals  which makes it difficult to predict the overall impact of JAK inhibitors on tumor therapy where prolonged virus presence might translate to better therapeutic efficacy 
Also  while the immune stimulating and anti tumor effects of type I and type II interferons may be adversely affected by JAK inhibitors  central tumor promoting cascades mediated by JAKs  such as IL STAT  may also be inhibited    yielding a difficult to predict net therapeutic outcome 
At the moment  more studies are needed to establish the overall impact of interference with JAK  signaling in cancer therapy Spurred by earlier reports of oncovirus reactivation and promoter enhancement by histone deacetylase  HDAC  inhibitors  this class of agents was assessed for capacity to enhance oncolytic virus potency by inhibiting antiviral responses 
Indeed  such enhancement was observed with oncolytic VSV and SFV  and while it has been difficult to pinpoint the exact mechanisms that underlie HDAC inhibitor enhancement of oncolytic virus replication in cancer cells  antiviral defenses in general are inhibited for yet unknown reasons mainly in cancer cells and not in normal cells  which indirectly facilitates virus replication   
Interestingly  combination of HDAC inhibitors with conditionally replicating   E A deleted adenovirus gave improved virus replication rate and therapeutic efficacy in subcutaneous xenograft models only when the inhibitors were given before the virus  otherwise inhibition of replication was observed   
Similarly  HDAC inhibitors increased replication and oncolytic efficacy of HSV when given before the virus but not when given at the same time   
With nuclear DNA viruses  such as adenovirus and HSV  it is possible that HDAC inhibitors also alter virus genome accessibility to transcription factors  resulting in reduced replication or other adverse effects  implying that with these viruses HDAC inhibitors should be administered before the viruses Recently  it was found that HDAC inhibitor vorinostat activates NfκB signaling by facilitating hyperacetylation of the p  subunit  which in turn activates cellular autophagy   
Autophagy was in another study shown to be important for VSV replication  presumably by inhibiting antiviral signaling 
This is interesting  as a previous study revealed enhancement of VSV replication by inhibiting TNF alpha induced antiviral signaling mediated by p  using NfκB inhibitors BMS  or TPCA    
In this study  neither inhibitor had an effect on STAT  or STAT  phosphorylation or their nuclear relocalization in response to type I IFN but the authors observed clear induction of ISG  GBP  and MX  in response to type I IFN in U  glioma cells  with the latter two being dependent on NfκB signaling 
Taken together  NfκB pathway activation may result in different antiviral responses in different cancer types  and inhibition or enhancement of oncolytic viruses by NfκB inhibitors is dependent on other concomitant cellular mechanisms  such as autophagy Since HDAC inhibitors modulate promoter activity accessibility  it is conceivable other epigenetic or promoter modifying agents could work in a similar manner to repress antiviral defense induction and enhance oncolytic viruses   
DNA demethylating agents  azacytidine  Aza  and decitabine synergized with oncolytic herpes simplex type   virus in glioma models in vitro and in vivo  as did HDAC inhibitor valproic acid  VPA  which was already shown before to work well with oncolytic HSV as well as several other oncolytic viruses   
Moreover  inhibition of cancer antiviral defenses  specifically RNAseL and PKR  resulted when cancer cells were exposed to sunitinib  a multi tyrosine kinase inhibitor originally developed as an inhibitor of VEGF R and PDGF R signaling  yielding strong anti tumor synergy with IFN sensitive oncolytic VSV   
Since sunitinib is approved for renal cell carcinoma and imatinib resistant gastric cancers  combination with oncolytic VSV constitutes a promising and clinically relevant approach warranting further investigation 
Interstingly  sunitinib as well as several other receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors displayed antiviral effects against polyomavirus BK    arguing that these compounds are not universal virus enhancers Cyclophosphamide  CPA  is a general immunosuppressant used to minimize Treg presence during immunotherapy and also oncolytic virotherapy 
CPA may  however  also enhance replication and efficacy of oncolytic viruses by diminishing cytokine secretion by stromal cells  including type I IFN   
Another compound enhancing oncolytic virus efficacy by lowering cell responsiveness to type I IFN is triptolide  which acts downstream of IRF  activation   
Further  the kinase mammalian target of rapamycin  mTOR  enhances the antiviral effects of type I IFN by activation of its effector proteins  E BP  which binds and inactivates translation factor eIF E  and S K  which carries out cell type specific signaling functions of type I IFN  such as activation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor  B and promotion of ISG  transcription 
Consequently  rapamycin was able to enhance oncolytic VSV replication and anti tumor efficacy by inhibiting type I IFN mediated antiviral signaling via mTOR   Several other compounds synergizing with oncolytic viruses have been identified via high throughput drug library screening  many of which seem to act by antagonizing antiviral defenses 
For instance  a novel virus sensitizer  Vse  was found to greatly diminish antiviral effects of type I IFN against oncolytic VSV in several cancer cell types  and the drug also synergized with the virus in subcutaneous mouse tumor models   
For many of these new compounds  the mechanism of action is still poorly understood  necessitating extensive safety studies to exclude undesirable effects against normal cells Apart from classical type I IFN induced antiviral defenses  which typically prevent virus translation and degrade virus genomes  other cellular machineries regulate oncolytic virus efficacy 
Notably  strategies to increase cancer cell death in response to oncolytic viruses have been tested 
In a recent study  a class of compounds called SMAC mimetics synergized in several cancer models with oncolytic VSV by removing cancer cell block to apoptosis in response to virus induced type I IFN  TNF α or TRAIL   
Interestingly  since virus infection triggered cytokines act on nearby non infected cells  SMAC mimetics may in combination with oncolytic viruses also cause significant bystander tumor destruction 
Normal cells are not affected by the IFN SMAC mimetic synergy  providing an important safety aspect 
In another study  blocking the ER stress response circuitry triggered by oncolytic rhabdovirus infection by a small molecular inhibitor of serine threonine protein kinase and endoribonuclease IRE α  which was identified in a genome wide siRNA screen  greatly enhanced cytotoxicity via caspase induced apoptosis and increased oncolytic efficacy in refractory tumor models in mice   
This effect was independent on induction or responsiveness to type I IFN 
Conversely  inhibitors of nucleoside transporter   ENT  were discovered from a high throughput screen of enhancers of oncolytic HSV  and to date such inhibitors have not been reported to alter cellular antiviral responses   
Other compounds  such as common chemotherapeutics  and their mechanisms synergizing with oncolytic viruses have been discussed elsewhere for most of them the possible role of antiviral defense antagonism in enhancing oncolytic virus efficacy remains to be studied   Thus  many compounds are available to interfere with tumor antiviral defenses 
The outstanding question for most of them  however  seems to be why such compounds do not render normal cells sensitive to oncolytic viruses 
Elucidation of the exact mechanisms of action and the differences between normal and cancer cells constitute a worthy goal for studies in the near future Already in the  s it became clear that using certain pathogenic wildtype viruses  such as West Nile virus and Bunyamwera virus  in cancer patients would result in off target toxicity   
Characteristic for pathogenic viruses is a greater ability to circumvent or antagonize cellular innate antiviral defenses than attenuated strains 
For example  unlike the prototypical oncolytic reovirus strain type   Dearing  the T L strain of reovirus causes accumulation of IRF  in the nucleus and inhibits activation of a select group of ISGs yet because of this property the T L strain is myocarditic unlike the oncolytic type   Dearing strain   
For these reasons  many oncolytic viruses used today  such as reovirus type   Dearing  oncolytic strains of Newcastle disease virus and M mutated VSV have either a stronger capacity to induce or a weaker capacity to resist antiviral type I IFN than the corresponding wildtype strains   An open question  however  is whether strain specific or virus specific differences that relate to specific components of the cellular antiviral machinery may be exploited for greater anti tumor efficacy  i e  if one virus fails  could another be used in its stead 
While Ras expression was critical for oncolytic reovirus replication in cells overexpressing CUG  oncogene  oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus was unable to replicate in the same cells due to increased activation of STAT  and OASL    
Thus  in these cells reovirus was not affected by STAT  or OASL  and it therefore remains interesting to see which other antiviral effectors may have been lacking in the CUG expressing cells and  conversely  how reovirus and VSV differ in terms of sensitivity to antiviral effectors 
While several oncolytic viruses have been compared to each other in terms of replication rate and cytotoxicity  systematic studies with regard to tumor antiviral defenses have not been conducted As any attenuated virus is likely to replicate effectively only in its own niche  i e  to be restricted by a specific set of ISGs  and as wild type strains may be too toxic for use in humans  a compromise may be achieved by incorporating select elements from wild type viruses into oncolytic virus backbones 
Indeed  several chimeric and recombinant viruses have been generated that harbor specific elements of wild type strains or even of other unrelated viruses in order to better resist cancer antiviral defenses  Table  
As an example of introducing wild type elements into attenuated viruses  Haralambieva reported on a measles virus Edmonston vaccine strain in which P gene was replaced with the counterpart from the wild type IC B strain   
Later  Meng et al 
included N  P  and L genes from wild type measles in Edmonston backbone  producing an enhanced but still safe oncolytic virus   
Edmonston vaccine virus induces a more robust IFN response compared to wild type measles virus partly due to the weaker ability of V protein to suppress MDA mediated activation of IRF  and IFN I induction   
In vivo  P gene encoded proteins  particularly V  control the quality of the cytokine response to measles so that vaccine strains qualitatively induce a stronger inflammatory response compared to WT strains  where WT V protein suppresses multiple cytokine secretion 
V protein short cytoplasmic tail has been shown to bind and inactivate STAT  IRF  MDA  and the Rel homology domain of the NfκB subunit p  but not of p    
Also  V causes LGP  protein to bind and inactivate RIG I    but it seemingly does not interfere with TICAM   TRIF  multiple TLR adaptor  including TLR mediated IFN β induction 
Thus  if cancer and normal cells would differ with regard to TICAM  or IRF  then such a virus could potentially target specifically cancer cells rather than normal cells 
So far  the measles Edmonston WT chimeras have proven safe in animals As an example of heterologous virus constructs  lentogenic Newcastle disease virus engineered to express influenza virus PR   H N  NS  showed enhanced oncolytic efficacy in vivo due to dampening of antiviral responses   
While such a virus did not display enhanced pathogenicity in that study  a mesogenic NDV virus harboring NS  from influenza strain H N  did show increased pathogenicity in chickens as well as an increased ability to replicate in human cells    raising some cautionary warnings for future engineering of similar replicative viruses 
As another example  vaccinia virus soluble type I IFN scavenger B R  NOTE  B R is often used in the literature  has been engineered into both oncolytic HSV and oncolytic rhabdoviruses  resulting in all cases in more effective therapy agents without loss of tumor specificity   
Oncolytic γ  gene deleted HSV was complemented by two different PKR antagonists from human cytomegalovirus  TRS  and IRS  generating a chimera capable of reaching wild type virus replication levels in cancer cells in vitro and in tumor models in vivo   The selection of various viral IFN I antagonists that potentially could be used to augment attenuated oncolytic viruses is vast   
For example  increased replication of several viruses  including HIV  Sindbis virus and E deleted adenovirus in mammalian cells was observed when the cells were engineered to express vaccinia virus E L protein  influenza A virus NS  protein  ebola virus VP  protein or HIV  Tat protein   
The choice of antagonist must primarily be made with safety in mind  but virus specific and cell specific differences in antagonist functions may potentially be exploited rationally when considering the overall combination 
For example  vaccinia virus E L is able to rescue VSV but not EMCV from exogenous IFN  whereas vaccinia virus K L partially rescued EMCV but not VSV   In anticipation of systematic  perhaps bioinformatically guided   super chimera  studies  two or more viruses that may complement each other s shortcomings in antiviral defense antagonism have been considered 
Notably  vaccinia virus was favorably combined with IFN I sensitive oncolytic VSV and SFV  yielding tumor model dependent increases in overall therapy efficacy that were dependent on vaccinia virus antagonism of type I IFN responses  which increased the replication of the IFN sensitive viruses   
Such heterologous virotherapy approaches may also be used to generate immunological synergy  similar to heterologous prime boost vaccination  anti tumor immune responses may be increased due to targeting of the tumor by two different viruses  on two separate occasions  but anti virus immune responses would be generated against different viruses each time  avoiding the problem of neutralizing immunity to and predominance of antivirus immune responses   
Some other ideas explored experimentally include engineering oncolytic viruses to express other oncolytic viruses 
For example  the entire oncolytic parvovirus H  genome was placed under a regulatable promoter in oncolytic adenovirus  resulting in a more effective therapeutic entity than either virus alone without loss of tumor specificity   
The genetic material of Semliki Forest virus replicons has been engineered into adenovirus and vaccinia virus backbones   and several other virus chimeras have been constructed   
However  the effects on tumor antiviral defenses of such a constructs remain to be studied The attribute  oncolytic  implies for a virus that it infects and  indeed  lyses the infected tumor 
This property is primarily tested in vitro in cultured tumor cells 
We have learned  however  that in the native tumor microenvironment in living hosts many viruses are no longer able to infect tumor cells or to kill them even if they manage to infect them 
Tightly packed tumor cells and the network of supportive molecules of the extracellular matrix form a physical barrier to virus particle diffusion 
It has also become evident that the tumor cells themselves may be much more capable of thwarting oncolytic virus advances than previously thought  with some tumor cells residing in a seemingly permanent non permissive antiviral state 
Tumors harbor multiple cell types in addition to the neoplastic cells  which may promote and propagate both physical and cellular virus resistance 
As the efficacy of virotherapy in human cancer patients still falls shy of the achievements in animal models  it appears quite plausible that one or more of the barriers described in this review indeed constitute a real and formidable obstacle for oncolytic virus advancement into routine clinical use 
Fortunately  some of the most difficult barriers have been identified  and a rapidly expanding arsenal of countermeasures is at our disposal 
Our task is now to separate the wheat from the chaff and to systematically evaluate the proposed combination regimens that will yield the best results without compromising patient safety Evidence of prenatal toxicity of herbal based indigenous formulations for sex selection in rat modelsTraditional or indigenous preparations  IPs  are getting considerable attention in global health debates  It continues to be used widely in several countries and its consumption is rapidly increasing 
 
  Many reports have documented the use of such preparations 
For instance  in China  traditional herbal medicines played a critical role during the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome  SARS  In fact  many drugs in modern medicine had their roots in the traditional system of medicine 
Drugs like Penicillin  from Penicillium fungi  and Digoxin  from Digitalis purpurea  are some such examples 
One of the promising therapies for Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus  MRSA  infection is a ninth century treatment for eye infections which is a recipe consisting of garlic and onions  wine  and bile from a cow s stomach brewed in a brass cauldron 
It is however important to note that culture specific practices are not always safe 
Digitalis is a classic example where herbalists use this plant in allopathic treatment strategies  while in some countries such as Britain  law restricts their vast availability  A report from Australia describes the adverse effects of ‘herbal  preparations or IPs  Problems arise when people do not report about the consumption of such preparations assuming that these are devoid of any side effects by virtue of them being natural products  The need for research in this field is huge and scientific research into the quality  safety  molecular effects and clinical efficacy is crucial 
 
 
Pregnancy is considered a time of minimal intervention  and a period when herbal medicines are usually contraindicated  It is reported that many women consume indigenous medicines  that contains Bryonia laciniosa  Quercus infectoria and Putranjiva roxburghii along with other ingredients  during early pregnancy to beget a male child in India 
These preparations  often called sex selection drugs  SSD  contain herbal ingredients but these are off the label prescriptions and hence cannot be certified as ‘herbal  medicines 
The prevalence of consumption varies from   to as high as         Studies have indicated that there is  –  times higher risk of birth defects including major malformations of internal organs like urogenital and renal malformation  trachea esophageal fistula  and visible defects like spina bifida  cleft lip palate and imperforate anus 
 
  Risk of stillbirths also increases   folds 
Studies suggest that a single exposure during pregnancy can be deleterious 
 
 
 
  SSDs are reported to contain phytoestrogens  steroids and heavy metals 
 
 
 
  It is also known that although placenta serves as a barrier  most drugs and environmental chemicals enter the foetal circulation by passive diffusion or active transport  However  despite growing evidence on deleterious effects of these herbal formulations  few studies have attempted to systematically understand the risk of such preparations using animal models 
Genetic sex of a child is determined at the time of conception by the fertilization of the ovum with X or Y sperms and intake of so called preparations for sex selection can never alter that In view of these  the current study was conducted with an objective to determine the embryo foetal and development toxicity of SSDs following maternal exposure during critical period of organogenesis using a small animal model The study was guided by the OECD guidelines for testing of chemicals  Guideline no    adopted on  nd January   Prenatal Developmental Toxicity Study  and was based on a mutually approved protocol

The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee  Venus Medicine Research Center 
Due permission was taken from the Ethics Committee of Indian Institute of Public Health Delhi For this experiment  strain of Sprague Dawley of rats  Rattus norvegicus  was used 
The number of dams per group was   instead of   as laid down under OECD guidelines 
Rats of both sexes  –  g  were obtained from National Institute of Biologicals  India at  –  weeks of age  acclimatized for five days and then subjected to the experiment at  –  weeks of age 
They were housed in standard polypropylene rat cages with stainless steel top grill  one dam per cage  at a temperature of       °C  with  –  relative humidity 
Bedding material and cages were changed once in six days and   hourly light dark cycle was followed 
Animals were identified by their existing ear numbering 
Cages were labelled by tags indicating the study number  sex  group of the animals  experimental start and completion dates 
Standard pelleted feed  from Ashirwad Industries  Mohali  India  was provided ad libitum to all the animals 
They also had free access to purified water via drinking bottles throughout the study 
The feed  cages and drinking bottles were not analysed for the presence of phytoestrogens and bisphenol A 
However  similar materials were used for all the rats across all groups The drug comprised of IPs for sex selection  SSD 
These non branded locally made preparations are made available  –  days after placing an order and are never sold openly 
These preparations essentially contain herbal ingredients such as Shivlingi  Bryonia laciniosa  Majuphal  Quercus infectoria  Putrajeevak  Putranjiva roxburghii  Nagkesar  Mesua ferrea  and feather of peacock  Pavo cristatus 
A total of   such samples of SSDs were procured from varied sources like ‘pansari  shop owners  grocers  local alternative medicine practitioners  rickshaw pullers  drivers and commoners from different states 
SSDs are advised to be consumed between   and   weeks of pregnancy The samples were categorized into   groups based on redundancy of the preparations and common ingredients reported 
This was followed by chemical analysis in an accredited laboratory to detect the presence of phytoestrogens and steroids 
Since we explored the toxic effects of these preparations we wanted to select two samples that would be most predictive of toxicity 
Due to resource constraints  we did not want to subject all the   samples for animal study 
Hence  three samples of SSDs  found to be most rich in phenols and steroids were selected for toxicity study  All the three samples were also tested for heavy metals which suggested that Lead and Mercury were in very high quantities  The toxicity was examined using C  elegans  an alternate animal model 
Survival analysis and reproductive toxicity was assessed from the brood size and progeny count assay  The two SSDs that were found to be most toxic were selected as test items for the subsequent study in rat models 
SSD   was reported to contain Shivlingi and Putrajeevak while SSD   contained Shivlingi  Majuphal  Putrajeevak  Nagkesar and feathers of peacock 
Both the samples were obtained from grocers 
Local preparations like these are bound to have certain degree of variability in concentrations but more often than not  these remain the major ingredients According to studies reported  women consume such preparations along with cow s milk in dosages and schedule that are quite varied 
While some advise these IPs to be consumed for one day  others prescribe it for   days  to be taken thrice a day 
We considered the amount of SSDs most commonly reported by pregnant women  weighing   kg  which was  –  g daily for   days 
The dose of the test item   mg kg  was calculated by using conversion factor of  Conversion factor is the ratio of the correction factors  estimated by dividing the average body weight in kgs of species by the body surface area in m  of the species  Km

Or  animal dose         mg kg           mg kg Since pregnant women consume these orally  these were administered to rats by oral route The test items were coded as SSD   and SSD   and were provided to the experimental laboratory  Venus Medicine Research Center  Baddi  in powder form 
On the day of dosing  the doses were administered between  –  h  The test items were administered in fresh cow s milk at a final volume of   ml kg 
The doses were calculated on the basis of the latest body weight recorded for the study 
A stainless steel gavage cannula fitted to a calibrated syringe was used for dosing the animals For control animals  cow s milk was used as a vehicle while feeding The study was performed in two phases to evaluate the effect of SSD consumption duration during gestation period Adult  nulliparous female rats were mated with males of same species and strain in  
Each morning  dams were examined for the presence of a vaginal plug and vaginal smear was taken from each dam by using pipette smear technique 
The day of vaginal plug formation or sperms observed in vaginal smear  also known as successful mating  were considered as GD   Gestation day  
The mated females were housed individually in clear polycarbonate cages with stainless steel wire lids 
Mating process was carried out to result in   pregnant animals per group 
Successfully mated females were randomized into control and treatment groups 
All the rats were sacrificed on GD  
According to OECD guidelines  the test chemical should be administered daily from implantation to the day prior to scheduled caesarean section in order to assess toxicity 
Test chemicals were administered to pregnant animals and sacrificed as per the schedule  which was as close as possible to the normal day of delivery without risking loss of data resulting from early delivery i e GD  
The females were killed  before caesarean section  the uterine contents were examined  and the fetuses were evaluated for soft tissue and skeletal changes The pregnant rats were randomized to two intervention and one control groups 
SSD was given during pre implantation to implantation stage  GD  – 
Each group of rats was treated either with vehicle  G  VC  SSD   G    mg kg  or SSD   G    mg kg SSDs were given from GD  – 
Each group of rats was treated with either vehicle or SSD  or SSD 
Allocation of animals was randomized to the following groups  G   Control  VC  G   SSD    mg kg  G   SSD    mg kg  G   SSD    mg kg  G   SSD    mg kg  G SSD    mg kg  G   SSD    mg kg The following parameters were observed •Clinical Signs  Animals were observed once after successful mating or on GD  and after administration of the first dose 
Cage side observations for clinical signs of toxicity in the animals were recorded once daily until the day before necropsy •Body weight  Body weight of all experimental animals were recorded once before mating  initial body weight  and then after confirmation of mating 
Body weights were recorded on days               and on terminal day before sacrifice 
These recorded body weights were used for calculating the dose volume to be administered •Food consumption  Food consumption was evaluated once after successful mating or on day   of gestation  the day of vaginal plug formation or sperms observed in vaginal smear  and on days             and one day prior to sacrifice 
Calculated amount of feed were placed in the trough of each cage and the quantity of feed remaining after approximately   h were weighed and recorded •Morbidity Mortality  All the animals were observed twice daily  once in the morning between   and   h and once in the evening between   and   h  for incidence of morbidity and or mortality •Maternal examination related parameters  At the end of the observation period  all the dams were sequentially euthanized  by CO  asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation  and subjected to gross necropsy 
After termination  dams were examined macroscopically for any structural abnormalities or pathological changes 
Blinding was done while evaluation of the dams during caesarean section and subsequent foetal analyses to minimize bias 
Pregnancy rate was calculated as the proportion of mated pairs that had produced at least one pregnancy within a fixed period where pregnancy was determined by the earliest available evidence that fertilization has occurred 
Gestation index was calculated to indicate number of females with live born as a proportion of number of females with evidence of pregnancy •Examination of uterine contents  Immediately after termination  the uteri were removed and the pregnancy status of the animals ascertained 
Gravid uteri including the cervix were weighed  and number of corpora lutea were determined 
The uterine contents were examined for numbers of embryonic or foetal deaths and live foetuses 
The degree of resorption was described in order to estimate the relative time of death of the conceptus 
Any increase in the number of resorption and or implantation loss is an indicator of litter size for the individual dam •Examination of foetuses  The sex and weight of each foetus were determined 
Approximately one half of each litter were prepared and examined for skeletal alterations from selected dams 
The remainder were prepared and examined for soft tissue alterations  using accepted or appropriate serial sectioning methods or careful gross dissection techniques 
Each foetus was examined for external alterations 
Foetuses were examined for skeletal alterations  using Alizarin Red S staining method 
The fetuses for skeletal staining were kept in pre labelled plastic containers containing   ethanol before staining 
After skinning  we processed the foetus for staining by immersing in   alcian blue   GX for three days  then performed rehydration through a gradient series of ethanol   ethanol   –  h twice    ethanol   –  h  ethanol   –  h  distilled water until the samples sank to the bottom of a conical tube 
Samples were further treated with   KOH for  –  days or until it became clear and again treated with   alizarin red for next  –  days until bones became purple 
Samples were rinsed   times in   KOH  for  –  h at each time point 
Samples were further treated with a gradient series of glycerol  KOH    h   glycerol   h X  Visceral examination was done by micro dissection technique 
Fetuses were preserved in   formalin until they became fixed 
An illuminated magnifier was used for visceral examination 
We placed the foetus in a supine position on a paraffin wax block tray covered with paraffin wax  secured the fetal limbs by paper pins to the paraffin wax block  made a ventral midline incision from the umbilicus  cutting caudally to the genital tubercle and cranially to the diaphragm 
Once incision was completed  we located the ventral attachment of the diaphragm and lifted the liver carefully to examine the diaphragm for abnormal opening 
After observation  the diaphragm was clipped 
We gave a longitudinal cut to open the rib cage slightly lateral to and on the right of the sternebrae and then extended the cut anteriorly to neck region 
The rib cage was opened gently and secured to the paraffin block petridish tray with pins Foetuses were examined for soft tissue alterations  e g 
variations and malformations or anomalies  using Wilson s Technique 
The fetal viscera were examined sequentially  beginning with thoracic organs and moving caudally 
We performed hearts cuts after completion of other observations 
We examined the bilobed thymus for size  shape  coloration and presence of haemorrhages and then removed it for observation of trachea and esophagus 
We observed the lungs for size  color and number of lobes  observed the trachea  esophagus for normal alignment and presence of fistula  opened the pericardial sac and cut off pericardium to expose the heart for observation 
We checked the size  shape  color of the heart and normal development of major blood vessels 
After observation of thoracic viscera  we observed the abdominal viscera and liver for size  shape  color  texture  and number of lobes 
External anatomy of heart was examined by making two incisions using micro dissecting scissors We examined the stomach  spleen  pancreas  small and large intestines for size  position or any other developmental anomalies 
The intestines were moved aside after observation for seeing the underlying structures 
Ureters were checked for normal size and location and for continuity from the renal hilus to the urinary bladder 
One kidney was cut transversely and another was longitudinally to examine renal papilla and renal pelvis 
To confirm the sex of the foetus  the gonads were inspected carefully 
We examined the reproductive organs for size  shape and location GraphPad Prism® statistical software version   was used to analyze the data and all the results were represented as mean   S E M 
Intergroup variance for most of the parameters was calculated by one way analysis of variance  ANOVA  followed by Tukey s test 
A value of p     was regarded statistically significant 
Linear regression was performed to examine the weight change of dams during pregnancy for each group comparing with the control after adjusting for the litter size 
The malformations were analysed by performing Chi square test for trend for two groups  SSD  G  G  G  G  and SSD  G  G  G  G The ARRIVE guidelines were followed to report the findings 
In phase   pre natal study  all the dams dosed with SSD  and SSD  had normal food intake and weight gain 
The average gain in weight from GD  to GD   was       gms for controls while it was       gms in SSD   and       gms in SSD 
 Webtable  
No test item related mortality or clinical sign of toxicity was encountered during the study 
All dams in treatment groups and control group survived to scheduled terminal sacrifice 
They showed normal behaviour until euthanized 
There were no differences in mean maternal body weights  body weight gains  pregnancy rate  gestational index  pre and post implantation loss  and resorptions 
No significant differences were observed in foetal sex ratio  foetal body weights 
However  one dam from SSD  had all male foetuses 
No abnormality was detected in skeletal and visceral examination In phase   controls and SSD  and SSD  treated dams exhibited a comparable food intake  Table  
 
However  a dose response relationship was observed with reduced weight gain with higher doses of SSDs 
 Table  
 
Two dams  one in G   SSD    mg kg  and the other in G   SSD    mg kg  categories showed decreased or consistent body weight GD  onwards 
On an average  the weight on GD   was       gms in controls while it was       with SSD    mg kg  and       gms with SSD    mg kg 
The adjusted analysis indicated that except in G  there was a significant reduction in weight gain in all the intervention groups as compared to the control group after controlling for litter size  Table  
 During follow up  one dam from SSD    mg kg  and one from SSD    mg kg  showed haematuria during gestational day  – 
However  no another clinical sign of toxicity was encountered during the study 
All the dams in treatment and control groups showed normal behaviour and survived to scheduled terminal sacrifice 
In phase   pregnancy rate and gestational index were found to be   at all dose levels with SSD  whereas  in SSD  it decreased to   in G   SSD    mg kg  and G   SSD    mg kg  groups 
One dam from G   SSD    mg kg  and another one from G   SSD    mg kg  group showed mating confirmation during vaginal smear examination and showed positive sign in initial days of pregnancy but during necropsy on expected day of delivery  GD   no foetus was found 
Body weights of dams increased in the initial stages that became constant at a later period 
To reconfirm it  non gravid uterus was stained in salewski strain and presence of conceptus was found 
This indicated the possibility of miscarriage Increased pre and post implantation losses as well as resorptions and reduced live foetuses were observed with both SSD  and SSD 
No significant differences were observed in foetal sex ratio  but decreased foetal body weights were noted in both sexes 
On an average one early resorption in a group was a normal observation 
More than one late resorption was observed in all treatment groups while there was none in the control group 
Total count of live foetuses count was significantly reduced with SSD  and SSD  treatment in a dose dependent manner 
Total number of live foetuses were reduced up to   in SSD  at   mg kg treatment group and   in SSD  at   mg kg treatment group Both SSD  and SSD s at different dose levels showed decreased fetal weight in dose dependent manner  although the difference was not significant 
Skeletal and soft tissue alterations were observed in both treatment groups 
In general  the embryo–foetal examination showed abnormalities  which could have caused some functional damage to these foetuses if allowed to grow in the normal course 
In visceral examinations  slight dilation of the renal pelvis  reduced papilla size  urinary bladder hypertrophy was observed in few foetuses from both SSD  and SSD  treatment groups 
Few incidences of foetal soft tissue abnormalities encountered in this study were normal variants 
Skeletal examination showed variations in the ossification patterns like incomplete or poorly ossified skulls  ossification of sternebra  cleavage ossification of thoracic centrum  asymmetric thoracic centrum  and supernumerary rib in many foetuses in SSD  and SSD  groups  Table  
 
A trend was noted with increased incidence of certain malformations with increasing dosages of SSDs that was statistically significant for most malformations with SSD The results of this developmental toxicity study suggest that administration of SSDs to pregnant rats had significant impact on intrauterine foetal growth  early and late resorption as well as developmental anomalies 
These formulations have teratogenic potential but does not affect sex ratio IPs contain phytoestrogens like diadzein and genistein  In vitro rat whole embryo culture assay  WEC  studies of genistein in rats have indicated fetotoxic and teratogenic potential at concentration of ≥  μg mL  However  in vivo  an oral  gavage  embryonic and fetal development pilot study could not demonstrate any teratogenic effect in the same study 
These findings are different from our study probably because we used SSDs containing natural herbal and non herbal ingredients unlike those studies where synthetic genistein was used 
In both the studies  decreased body weight was observed indicating slight maternal toxicity 
Food consumption was unaffected in our study which is contrary to what was reported 
In another study  pregnant rats exposed to oral isoflavones  diadzein and genistein in varying combinations  showed alterations in the number of live foetuses  lysed foetuses  number of resorption sites  and implantation sites while no clinical signs suggestive of maternal toxicity  seizures  tremors and salivation  that was observed similar to our study 
Maternal mass gain was significantly reduced in rats treated with   mg kg of isoflavones  Ratio of females to males in the litter of different groups was similar akin to our finding  These observations clearly nullify the claim that consumption of SDDs could alter the sex of the growing foetus 
An analysis done by the same authors earlier revealed that SSDs contain testosterone and steroids 
 
  The prenatal testosterone in pregnancy is known to affect sexual development adversely      The principles of reproductive biology state that the genetic sex of an individual is determined at the time of conception and can never be altered under any circumstances 
However  phenotypic sex of the growing foetus is likely to be influenced by the hormonal milieu of in utero environment 
Our analysis was confined to phenotypic sex only and hence it is difficult to state if any differences existed with reference to genetic and phenotypic sex 
This requires further inquiry Evidence on the effects of SSDs on humans should best be obtained from human beings 
The findings of the current study corroborate well with the evidence generated from observational studies in human beings      Presence of skeletal and visceral malformations could explain why stillbirths are likely to be more in women who consume SSDs 
The dosing of the test drugs was intended not only to examine the period of organogenesis solely but to assess effects from preimplantation  through the entire period of gestation to the day before caesarean section 
The results were based on observations of more than   female animals with implantation sites at necropsy that added to its strength 
Unnecessary handling of pregnant animals as well as any stressors from outside was avoided 
At least three dose levels and a concurrent vehicle control were used with dams randomly allocated to different treatment groups that support the validity of the results 
However  absence of   rats per group does not support it to be a fully OECD compliant study 
We did follow the principles of Good Laboratory Practices  GLP  but due to constraints of resources the study could not be conducted as a GLP compliant study  though this is optimal for academic interests There is a lack of systematic approach to assess the safety and effectiveness of herbal preparations 
Ingredients for herbal medicines are often drawn from different sources and are used in combination  which may exhibit variability in terms of species  growing conditions  and biologically active constituents 
To isolate each active ingredient from each herb and then to establish its toxicity is time consuming  resource intensive and not practical 
Moreover  drug approval process does not accommodate undifferentiated mixtures  Though important  it surpasses the herb herb interaction and the potentiating effect of one compound over another 
Therefore  in our study  we administered the herbal mixture to assess the effects 
Real time evaluations have yielded important observations for several herbal drugs especially related to pregnancy 
For instance  Wang et al 
  used mice model to evaluate the adverse pregnancy outcomes after maternal exposure to the herbal medicines  particularly during early pregnancy  The major events included maternal and perinatal mortality 
Maternal weight gain  embryo growth and post natal weight gain were significantly decreased 
Moreover  foetal resorption and skeletal malformations were increased  signifying potential toxicity of Chinese herbal medicines 
This is comparable to our findings To conclude  the results of this developmental toxicity study suggest that administration of SSD  and SSD  to pregnant rats exerted significant impact on intrauterine foetal growth and development without any effect on sex ratio when administered during the period of organogenesis

It is therefore natural to expect that the distribution of amino acids  across all protein sequences  would appear to be fixed  given no mutations over a specific period of time 
Of the   naturally occurring amino acids  each seems to appear randomly located at a particular position within the sequence of a protein 
However  when the sequences of a group of proteins are compared to one another  specific patterns begin to emerge 
These patterns are commonly referred to as motifs and frequently produce similar structural elements and in many cases  similar functions between the proteins that contain them 
In recent years  significant efforts have been made to reduce sequences into discrete motifs  so that each can be linked to some specific biological function based on particular rules      
Databases that consist of identifiable amino acid motifs  such as PROSITE  Pratt and EMOTIF  have been constructed to allow researchers an easy classification of unknown proteins into families based on their common motifs               
All of these methods share one property  they depend on specific alignment algorithms  such as the basic local alignment search tool  BLAST or PSI BLAST  to perform the sequence comparison between diverse families of proteins being analyzed      
These methods have already led to a number of key discoveries and offer the promise of determining biologically meaningful information about function from a protein s primary sequence It is generally accepted that a strong correlation exists between a protein s amino acid sequence and its resulting structure and function         
Techniques that can quickly determine significant similarities between protein sequences are valuable in predicting an unknown protein s function within the cell 
Here we describe a procedure that  by computing the frequency of key amino acid pairs  can quickly classify large groups of proteins into functional groups 
In order to uncover any relevant amino acid strings  we have utilized statistical methods applicable to datasets with large fluctuations in the search of human protein sequences within both the Swiss Prot and Complete Human Genebank databases The goal of this manuscript is to demonstrate how these two residue motifs can be used to develop rapid methods for searching protein or genomic databases in order to locate potentially interesting or aberrant protein sequences 
As an example  we describe the distribution of select amino acid pairs within the genome of the Coronavirus  Tor  which is responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome  SARS    
We have examined additional sets  but the limited format of this paper precludes a large presentation of potential applications The set of all   naturally occurring  amino acids are described by their standard single letter representations  and are taken as the complete set contained within all protein sequences as shown below Zq A R N D C Q E G H I L K M F P S T W Y V Residues that are arranged in a certain order can be referred to as vectors and are represented symbolically as b n b b bn bj Zq The coordinates of each vector represent the amino acid symbols contained within any given protein  where n is the total length of the vector 
The collection of all vectors b n  in the proteome can therefore be denoted simply by Zq n The underlying structure of a protein sequence  which is the order of the amino acids  has unique and identifiable characteristics 
As an analogy  in written English  the letter q is almost always followed by u 
Also  the frequency of the word  and  is much higher than that of the related three letter strings   nad   nda   dan  and  dna  which are simply permutations of the same set of individual letters to construct a word with a different meaning 
Utilizing similar characteristics  we can intuitively scan for unique sequence vectors contained within any given protein 
We expand on these characteristics  by utilizing the concepts of affinity and order stability in Section  Using the entire Swiss Prot database  release number   as the basis for our calculations  we have constructed a probability table for the occurrence of the   naturally occurring amino acids  see Table  
    
In addition to the Swiss Prot database  we have also included data from Complete Human Genebank  NCBI Build Number   March    as a source for all characterized and hypothetical human protein sequences We use the symbol Ω to denote the Swiss Prot database  and the letter M to denote the number of proteins in the database  
Hence we can state that Ω As s M  where As a a as Ns  is the sth protein  ai with i Zq is the ith amino acid in the sequence  and Ns is the length of the protein sequence As 
For any vector b n  if there is a sequence As in Ω such that b n  is a segment of As  then we can say b n  occurs in Ω 
We can then use NΩ b n  to denote the total number of outcomes that b n  has occurred in Ω  and let NΩ n  be the total number of all vectors occurring in Ω with length n  Therefore p b n NΩ b n NΩ n is the probability that the vector b n  occurs in Ω 
We then introduce k p q b n log p b n q b n where p b n  and q b n  are any two probability distributions on Zq n  and b n  belongs to Zq n 
The quantity k p q b n  in Eq 
  is defined for any two probability distributions p b n  and q b n  on Zq n  where the distribution q arises from independent letter  i e  amino acid  probabilities 
Then  k p q b n  can be viewed as a random variable about b n  and its probability distribution is defined as follows F p q x PI k p q b n ⩽x b n k p q b n ⩽xp b n The expectation value μ p q  and variance σ p q  of p b n  are expressed mathematically as μ p q b n Zq n p b n k p q b n 
 σ p q b n Zq n p b n k p q b n μ p q  Hence we see that μ p q  is simply the Kullback–Leibler entropy   
As a consequence  μ p q  is always non negative and μ p q  if and only if p b n q b n 
As a result  the amino acid sequence of b n  can be represented by k p q b n In Eq 
  the probability distributions p  q in the k p q b n  have several possible values 
For example  if we let p be the probability of b n  and only change the value of q in k p q b n  we obtain the following expression q b n j np bj p b p b p bn Based on Eqs 
  and   the value of k p q b n  gives us the affinity for all amino acids within vector b n 
Here two situations are identified as especially interesting i When k p q b n  implies that among the amino acids in vector b n  there is an increased affinity 
That is  the vector b n  occurs more frequently than expected 
 ii When k p q b n  implies that among the amino acids in vector b n  there is a decreased affinity 
That is  the vector b n  occurs less frequently than expected In a similar approach to the condition described above  we may choose q b n p πn b n  where πn b n  is a permutation of b n  and πn denotes a permutation transform 
In this case  the order sensitivity of b n  can also be reflected by the value of k p q b n  and produces the following outcomes i when k p q b n  implies that b n  occurs much more often than πn b n ii when k p q b n  implies that πn b n  occurs much more often than b n In addition to the concepts of affinity and order sensitivity  we can also design other analysis techniques by choosing alternate representations of q b n 
Quantifying the terms k p q b n  we can represent vector frequency numerically 
In cases where k p q b n μ p q ⩾ σ p q  the corresponding vector b n  is called  positive  while in those cases where the opposite takes place  k p q b n μ p q ⩽ σ p q  the vector b n  is called  negative 
By judiciously choosing a   equal to   we obtained   two residue  positive pairs  and   two residue negative pairs  see Table  
  out of a total of   possibilities of amino acid pairs Using any one of the positive motifs from Table   we can develop a test method to detect changes in their distribution through any protein database 
If b b b  is  positive  then p b b μ σp b p b  where p ⋅  is the probability of the amino acids or vectors ⋅ in the database 
Since NΩ μ M Nμ p bj NΩ bj μ MNμ we have NΩ b μ M Nμ μ MNμ μ σp b NΩ b or NΩ b μ M Nμ μ MNμ μ σp b NΩ b and since μ M Nμ is very close to μ MNμfor Swiss Prot database we have NΩ b μ σp b NΩ b and NΩ b μ σp b NΩ b As a consequence of Eq 
  the detection of a deleterious mutation based on the increased appearance of an arbitrary string of these residues becomes possible 
For example  according to Table   CC is an attractive motif with   then NΩ CC μ σp C μ M Nμ μ MNμNΩ C ≈ μ σp C NΩ C Let Ns CC  and Ns C  be the number of CC and the number of C in the sth protein 
Then we have NΩ CC NΩ C  because μ σ  and p C  since NΩ CC s MNs CC NΩ C s MNs C Based upon the result that the CC pair represents a rare event  proteins satisfying Ns CC Ns C  as defined in Eq 
  suddenly become interesting 
We can therefore consider the number Ns CC  as an index to develop detection methods to test for the presence of a CC containing protein within a database 
Using this same reasoning  one can also use any other one of the remaining motifs in Table   to develop detection methods for additional proteins In an identical fashion to the previous example using the positive two residue motifs in Table   we can also use any of the  negative  two residue motifs to develop search methods 
For example  the CM pair is a  negative  two residue  word  with  
That is  p CM μ σp C p M 
Using identical arguments to those described in Section   we obtain NΩ CM NΩ M  and NΩ CM NΩ C 
Since both Ns M  and Ns C  are small numbers for fixed proteins  the overall number of CM pairs in most proteins should be close to zero 
Therefore  we can also use any of the remaining seven  negative  motifs in Table   to develop additional detection methods In contrast to the CC motif  the total number of proteins in the Swiss Prot database having more than one CM pair is quite small 
For example  among the   proteins contained within this database  the number of proteins such that Ns CM ⩾  is   and the number of proteins satisfying the condition Ns CM ⩾  is only  
For human proteins in Swiss Prot  the total number of proteins containing CM pairs is   and there are only   proteins that satisfy Ns CM ⩾   Table  
However  we would expect to find about   proteins having CM pairs in the Swiss Prot database  based upon the amino acid frequencies given in Table   which is greater than the number observed Cysteine rich proteins and the presence of CC pairs in proteins are both concepts that have been studied previously      
If we combine these two concepts and describe them in mathematical terms  we observe that the rates q Ns C Ns and q Ns CC Ns C  describe these two conditions  where Ns  Ns C  and Ns CC  are the numbers of all amino acids  cysteine  and CC  respectively 
We can then derive proteinsNs C Ns p C σ Ns CC Ns C p ξτ C ξτ C σ where σ  and σ  are the standard deviations about Ns C Nss Mand Ns CC Ns C s M respectively We have found the following computational results based on Swiss Prot database σ ≈ σ ≈ andp ξτ C ξτ C ⩾ p C For   we have a much simpler method to determine that a protein sequence is both C  and CC rich if proteinsNs C Ns ∩proteinsNs CC Ns C So  a much simpler method to test whether a protein is a both C  and CC rich for   isNumber of CC  Number of C Number of C  Length of protein Using this principle  we found a total of eight proteins that are both C  and CC rich within the Swiss Prot database For   there is an easier method to determine whether a protein sequence is both C  and CC rich if proteinsNs C Ns ∩proteinsNs CC Ns C So  a much simpler method to test whether a protein is both C  and CC rich for   is based on the inequalitiesNumber of CC  Number of C Number of C  Length of protein Using this principle  we can get a total of   proteins that are both C  and CC rich within the entire Swiss Prot database For   there is also an easier method to determine if a protein sequence is both C  and CC rich sequence when proteinsNs C Ns ∩proteinsNs CC Ns C So  a much simpler method to test whether a protein is both C  and CC rich for   is based on the inequalitiesNumber of CC  Number of C Number of C Length of protein Using this principle  we have identified a total of   proteins that are both C  and CC rich within the Swiss Prot database 
From these results  it becomes clear that there are many C rich proteins and many CC rich proteins that are not mutually inclusive 
The sets of both C  and CC rich proteins are only subsets of the set containing all C rich proteins or that containing all CC rich proteins Because the Swiss Prot database is somewhat biased to those proteins that are of interest to researchers  we have decided to examine a database that was  in essence  complete 
For this  we chose the human subset sequences contained within the Complete Human Genebank database 
This was the most complete and readily available source of human genetic sequences and should therefore provide us with an accurate representation of both CC and CM pair distributions 
We observed that the total number of CC pairs within the human subset of sequences contained in Genebank  a total of   proteins  was  
These pairs were contained within a total of   proteins  Table   a number that is substantially larger than the   we obtained from Swiss Prot data  Table  
Since the total number of amino acids in The Complete Human Genebank is   we can easily get the expected number of CC in Complete Human Genebank is   which is much less than this actual value  
The same also holds true for the CM pair  where we would expect to see   CM pairs  but actually observe    Table  
 
This result is surprising but true and shows that there are fundamental difference between the Human and other species in terms of the frequency of CC and CM pairs To create a single CM pair  it is obvious that one needs only a single C  If a protein sequence also contains a CC pair  the total number of cysteines available to create a CM pair has been reduced by a factor of  
Using the cutoff value of four CC pairs as statistically significant  we determined the probability of finding a CM pair within proteins that already contained a CC pair  Table  
Even though both CC and CM can occur in the same protein  the total number of proteins in Genebank that contain both CC and CM pairs is   and these pairs almost always occur at different locations in the sequence 
However  in some rare cases the second C within the CC pair is shared with the first C within the CM pair  giving us a new triplet CCM If we filter the set of proteins described above for redundant entries  we obtain a set of   unique proteins that contain the CCM triplet in the human proteome 
Using the probability distributions obtained from Swiss Prot  we obtained the probability of CCM as  
Since the total of all protein lengths in the Swiss Prot database is   there should be a total of   CCM triplets 
This value is almost identical to the predicted number of CCM of  
This result suggests that the CCM triplet at least in Swiss Prot occurs randomly 
However  we can also analyze the CCM probability using a different approach  putting q CCM p CC p M  into Eq 
 
If CCM occurs randomly  then we have p CCM p C p C p M  and since p CC μ σp C p C  we will get k p q CCM log p CCM q CCM log p C p CC ⩽ μ σ Based on Eq 
  it is clear that the presence of a CC pair strongly excludes M  Therefore  the probability of the CCM triplet should occur less frequently than that of CC or M individually We have obtained the following statistical results with regard to the total number of CC and CM pairs contained in the Swiss Prot database i The total number of these proteins satisfying Ns CC ⩾  is   and   of these are found in humans 
 ii The total number of human proteins in Ω that satisfy Ns CC ⩾  is  
 iii The total number of the proteins in Ω that satisfy Ns CM ⩾  is     of these are found in humans 
 iv The total number of human proteins in Ω that satisfy Ns CM ⩾  is only  
The genome of the SARS associated Coronavirus contains a total of   open reading frames  which code for six characterized and five uncharacterized proteins   
After examining the complete proteome the SARS associated Coronavirus we observed a statistically significant increase in the occurrence of the CC and CM pairs in the SARS associated Coronavirus  genome Of the   putative proteins  four contain either CC or CM pairs 
Two large poly proteins  GI  and GI  contain   CC and   CM pairs  as well as   CC and   CM pairs  respectively 
The putative spike glycoprotein  GI    contains   CC and   CM  while the small envelope protein  GI    contains only   CC pair 
The remaining   proteins  of which two have been identified as a nucleocapsid and matrix protein  contain no CC or CM pairs 
When compared to the occurrence of CC and CM pairs within all human proteins found in the Swiss Prot database  it becomes clear that there is an increased occurrence of these pairs within the SARS associated Coronavirus proteome It is clear that the frequency of CC and CM pairs is significantly higher in the SARS genome than it is in the human genome 
It is our hope that these unique two residue motifs could be used as a means of identifying a virus such as SARS 
While currently impossible to determine  one can see a possible clinical use for determining the frequency of CC or CM pairs in an individual 
If a person has been infected by SARS  we would expect the numbers of CC and CM pairs to be much higher than in a healthy individual 
If we were then able to develop a clinically feasible technique that could identify the CC or CM pair content in total cellular protein  without damaging the cell  it could be possible to implement a detection method simply by counting the numbers of CC or CM pairs in all proteins examined 
If the presence of increased CC or CM pairs was indicative of infection by SARS we could develop new drugs to inhibit the translation of proteins that contain these pairs within infected cells 
As a very specific example  this could be accomplished through the use of specific tRNA mimics that could block translating ribosome when these pairs appear at the P and A site simultaneously      
While tRNA mimics could normally be seen as non specific protein synthesis inhibitors  the lower frequency of the CC or CM motifs in host proteins as compared to the relatively high occurrence in viral protein provide a starting point for the analysis of treatments using methods such as these In this paper we have performed a detailed search of the Swiss Prot and Complete Human Genebank database in relation to the frequencies of each of the   natural amino acids and motifs made up of two residues 
This has provided us with a new insight into the distribution of proteins within these databases and the information that may be contained within a protein s primary amino acid sequence 
Our focus in this quest has been to examine specific pairs or triplets of residues and use probability theory to assess whether or not particular strings of residues occur more frequently than their probability would indicate 
By analyzing affinity and anti affinity  we developed a procedure to search out all two  and three residue clusters within these databases 
Through this technique  we can rapidly classify large groups of proteins into families based on the occurrence of these motifs 
Combining this concept with a specific knowledge of protein function  we propose novel ideas aimed at developing fast detection methods for specific diseases based on the unusually high occurrence of some of these motifs when compared with the expected probabilities 
A timely example of the application of this method is given  namely the analysis of the SARS virus 
This method will hopefully lead to the discovery of new diagnostic techniques and possible treatment of diseases  by recognizing the location of target domains in the expressed sequence Cell type specific expression of the putative SARS CoV  receptor ACE  in human heartsThe coronavirus disease    COVID  caused by SARS CoV  infections imposes a major threat for the world s healthcare systems and is leading to thousands of deaths 
Angiotensin converting enzyme    ACE  has been identified as a potential receptor for SARS coronavirus  and is also considered the main receptor for SARS CoV  SARS CoV  binds to ACE  via its glycosylated outer membrane spike proteins 
ACE  is highly expressed in the lung and heart  and is known for its vital role in the cardiovascular system –  Although SARS CoV  mainly invades alveolar epithelial cells  it can also cause myocardial injury  as assessed by increased troponin T and NT proBNP levels accompanying increased cardiovascular symptoms in COVID infected patients  It is unclear whether elevated biomarkers of cardiac injury  or long term effects on the cardiovascular system  are directly caused by viral infection of cardiac tissue or are secondary to hypoxia and systemic inflammation 
However  patients with underlying cardiovascular disease represent a significant proportion of the patients who may suffer from a severe course after COVID  infection  This situation may be aggravated by findings showing that ACE inhibitors  which are often used to treat cardiovascular diseases  augment the expression of the SARS CoV  receptor ACE  in lung cells  This is probably mediated by an effect on angiotensin II  which is known to reduce ACE  expression  Thus  ACE inhibition decreases angiotensin II  leading to an indirect up regulation of ACE  The effect of angiotensin II receptor blockers  ARBs  which primarily target the angiotensin receptor   is unclear 
One may speculate that ARBs indirectly reduce ACE  levels by augmenting free angiotensin II levels  which in turn is expected to down regulate ACE  via activating the angiotensin receptor  
However  the effect of the two different treatments on the expression of ACE  in the heart requires further investigation Therefore  we used single nuclei RNA sequencing to determine the expression of ACE and ACE  in the different cell types of the human heart 
Gene expression signatures were detected in cardiac tissues of five patients with aortic stenosis  AS  and two patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction  HFrEF   Figure  A  and compared with with samples of one healthy donor heart  age    years  male  that was not used for transplantation 
After single nuclei RNA sequencing  data were pooled  and unsupervised clustering was performed with a total of     nuclei 
We found   distinct clusters 
Using cell type specific gene markers  major cell types were annotated  including cardiomyocytes  six clusters  fibroblasts  one cluster  endothelial cells  three clusters  leucocytes  two clusters  pericytes  one cluster  and smooth muscle cells  one cluster   Figure  B–D 
ACE  was expressed in cardiomyocytes  Cluster   and   and mural cells  particularly pericytes  Cluster   and was detected at a lower expression level in fibroblasts  endothelial cell  and leucocytes  Figure  D 
Comparison of ACE  in a pooled analysis of nuclei of the different groups showed that ACE  was significantly elevated in cardiomyocytes of patients with heart disease compared with healthy controls  Figure  E 
ACE  was also slightly  but not significantly  increased in endothelial cells  and the expression was lower in fibroblasts of patients with heart disease compared with healthy controls  Figure  E 
Immunostaining confirmed an increased expression of ACE  in cardiomyocytes of patients with aortic stenosis  Figure  F 
In addition  ACE was augmented in cardiomyocytes of patients with AS and HFrEF  Figure  G 
Interestingly  cardiomyocytes of patients who were treated with ACE inhibitors showed a significantly higher ACE  expression compared with ARB treated patients  Figure  H 
Moreover  patients treated with ACE inhibitors had an imbalance of ACE to ACE  expression  with a more than four fold higher ACE ACE  ratio compared with healthy control cells  Figure  I In conclusion  these data provide novel insights into the cell type specific expression and regulation of ACE  in the heart 
Patients with varying heart disease aetiology show augmented expression of ACE  levels particularly in cardiomyocytes 
Treatment with ACE inhibitors tends to be associated with increased ACE  mRNA and unfavourable ACE ACE  ratios  which are believed to be a driver of cardiovascular pathologies  This study is limited by its small sample size and therefore is only hypothesis generating 
However  these novel data suggest that it will be important to monitor SARS CoV infected patients for cardiovascular complications and assess the impact of ARB ACE inhibitor therapy 
Conflict of interest  none declared New onset acute symptomatic seizure and risk factors in coronavirus disease   A retrospective multicenter studyIn December   pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus  later called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus    SARS‐CoV‐  was first reported in Wuhan  China 
On March     the World Health Organization  WHO  declared the syndrome caused by SARS‐CoV‐  infection  coronavirus disease    COVID‐  a pandemic 
According to a WHO Situation Report of April    
 
 there are   confirmed COVID‐  cases and   deaths globally 
COVID‐  affects people of all ages 
 
  
 
 and in severe cases  it may cause dyspnea  hypoxia  acute respiratory distress syndrome  and septic shock 
 
  
 

The current situation has raised concerns regarding whether people with epilepsy have a higher risk to be infected with COVID‐  and whether people would develop acute seizures during the course of COVID‐ 
The objective of this study is to clarify the incidence and the risk of acute symptomatic seizures during acute COVID‐  infections This retrospective multicenter study was approved by the ethics committee of West China Hospital  Sichuan University  approval   
The study was conducted in   officially designed hospitals in Hubei province  the epicenter of the COVID‐  epidemic in China  Sichuan province  and Chongqing municipality 
These hospitals included the East Branch of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University  West China Ward  Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital  and hospitals in Sichuan province designated by the government to treat COVID‐   see the list of hospitals in Appendix S People with COVID‐  who were discharged from or died in the participating hospitals between January   and February     were consecutively enrolled 
All cases were diagnosed according to the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for COVID‐   trial version  
 
 All those enrolled tested positive through nucleic acid detection 
Disease severity was classified as mild  moderate  severe  or critical according to the national guidelines  see Box   for classification criteria 
 
 For our study  we aggregated severe and critical cases into a single severe group  whereas mild and moderate cases were aggregated into a single milder group 
The clinical outcome at discharge was either cured or death Electronic medical records of all enrolled cases were reviewed by   neurologists using a standard case report form  Appendix S 
Data were extracted on demographic characteristics  medical history  complications  treatments  and presence of risk factors for seizures 
These risk factors were considered to be the following  acute cerebrovascular disease  traumatic brain injury  TBI  central nervous system  CNS  infection  shock  hypoxia  severe metabolic disturbance  based on criteria from the International League Against Epilepsy
 
  multiple‐organ dysfunction syndrome  sepsis  and exposure to drugs or toxic substances Continuous variables were presented as median  interquartile range  and categorical variables as n  All of   people discharged from or who died at participating hospitals were consecutively identified and enrolled 
Most were from Sichuan province  n     followed by Chongqing  n     and Hubei  n    Ten individuals died  giving case fatality rates of    n     in Hubei     n     in Chongqing  and    n     in Sichuan 
Of the   severe cases      received mechanical ventilation  and     were given sedatives 
Apart from the effect of sedatives  mental state was relatively normal in   people 
Eight were encephalopathic  one was obtunded  one was delirious  and six were comatose 
The diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus was not made in any of these cases based on clinical presentation  results of investigations  or response to therapy 
No routine or long‐term electroencephalogram  EEG  was recorded due to exposure concerns None in this cohort had a past history of epilepsy 
None had any seizures  including febrile seizures  or status epilepticus during hospitalization 
Seizurelike events were seen in two people  it was believed that this was the result of an acute stress reaction in one and hypocalcemia in the other The first was a  ‐year‐old woman who reported bilateral bodily spasms lasting for about   minute  with mouth deviation but no impairment of awareness 
She was evaluated neurologically and psychiatrically and was diagnosed with an acute anxiety disorder  which was treated with olanzapine  paroxetine  and diazepam The second case was a  ‐year‐old woman who displayed bilateral myoclonus in the limbs with no impairment in consciousness   hours after admission 
Although this was initially suspected to represent seizures  she was found to have an electrolyte disturbance including hyponatremia  hypokalemia  and hypocalcemia  and the myoclonus resolved with correction of the metabolic disturbances Eighty‐four   cases reported systemic or direct brain insults that increased their risk for acute symptomatic seizures  Table  
The most common risk factor was hypoxia 
No severe electrolyte disturbance was seen  but hypokalemia  n       hyponatremia  n       and hypocalcemia  n       were frequently seen in the cohort 
Urea  creatinine  and serum glucose levels were moderately altered in most of cases 
In two cases who had chronic kidney dysfunction  substantial increases in creatinine levels were noted 
Results of investigations are shown in Table  
One case with TBI had an epidural hematoma  cerebral contusion  and skull base fracture 
Five people with severe COVID‐  experienced septic shock 
Three other cases of shock had hypovolemia or cardiac problems 
Ninety‐four   were given antibiotics  moxifloxacin  n       piperacillin sulbactam sodium  n       and third‐generation cephalosporins  n       were most commonly used We found no new onset seizures or status epilepticus in a large cohort of people hospitalized during the acute phase of COVID   infection despite a substantial proportion having risk factors for acute symptomatic seizures 
This is useful information  given the prior lack of knowledge about seizure risk during the acute phase of infection No individual in this cohort had a history of epilepsy prior to hospital admission 
To date  there is not much information available on people with epilepsy during the COVID‐  crisis 
There is one report of epilepsy in a case COVID‐  from Wuhan 
 
 As information is limited  it is not possible to establish whether this was a patient who had a history of epilepsy or whether the patient presented acute seizures 
There is at this time little if any evidence indicating that people with epilepsy are at an increased risk of COVID‐  infection 
A major challenge for people with epilepsy in this outbreak is nonadherence with the prescribed antiseizure medication  which was seen during the in SARS endemic in  
 
 This indicates the need to ensure the availability of supplies of medications and to advocate patients  self‐management 
Possible strategies for coping could also include online consultations and telemedicine networks Although many neurological and systemic disorders regarded as potential triggers
 
 of acute symptomatic seizures were identified in this cohort  seizures and status were not seen 
Stroke is one such risk factor 
The risk of developing acute symptomatic seizures after stroke ranges from   to  
 
 Acute cerebrovascular disease is considered a major cause of seizure and status epilepticus 
An earlier study from Hubei
 
  
 
 also reported six people with COVID‐  who had acute cerebrovascular disease without seizure 
Infection of the CNS can also give rise to seizures 
Although there is limited evidence of the presence of the SARS‐CoV‐  in the cerebrospinal fluid  CSF  the co‐occurrence of tubercular meningitis
 
 had been reported  with no seizure or status observed 
To determine whether COVID‐  can cause direct CNS insults requires further follow‐up 
In the earlier outbreaks of another coronavirus  a generalized convulsion with a positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for SARS‐CoV in CSF was reported  which could have been a coincidence 
 

Disturbances of homeostasis may lead to acute symptomatic seizures 
Hypoxia  the most common complication in our cohort  may trigger anoxic encephalopathy  particularly in refractory hypoxia 
Electrolyte disturbances as seen in COVID‐  are considered to be potential causes of acute symptomatic seizure 
 
 The severity and speed of such disturbances may affect onset of seizures  so these parameters should be carefully monitored The cytokine storm syndromes
 
 behind severe infection may cause the production of inflammatory cytokines systemically  with the consequence of acute toxic encephalopathies 
Although sepsis is a common cause of encephalopathy in intensive care medicine 
 
 hypoxia appears far more often than sepsis in COVID‐ 
There was also a high rate of septic shock in the COVID‐  population  varying from  
 
 to   in earlier studies in Hubei 
 
  
 

Certain antibiotics have been associated with symptomatic seizure 
 
 Antibiotics were used in a large number of people in our cohort without problems  but the most used antibiotics in the cohort were of low or moderate risk 
Clinicians should keep this seizure risk in mind when prescribing antibiotics  especially for people with renal dysfunction 
 

Our study has several limitations 
First  as a cross‐sectional study  we only have data from the acute phase of the disease 
A follow‐up study is underway to evaluate longitudinal seizure outcomes 
Second  the retrospective study design meant that we could not collect data on all relevant variables  for example  EEG was not recorded  so subclinical seizures could have been missed 
As all health care costs of COVID‐  treatment are covered by the government  all those suspected of infection are screened 
This may assure the objectivity and reliability of study materials  and it will allow for a future follow‐up study Our analysis suggests that COVID‐  poses minimal risk for seizures during the acute illness  although a significant proportion of severely ill individuals have risk factors that may increase the propensity to experience seizures 
These risk factors should be promptly addressed to minimize the risk of developing seizures 
Prospective long‐term studies must be done to determine whether people who have suffered from COVID‐  have an increased risk for developing seizures or epilepsy in subsequent months or years as a consequence of their illness None of the authors has any conflict of interest to disclose 
We confirm that we have read the Journal s position on issues involved in ethical publication and affirm that this report is consistent with those guidelines Decreased prealbumin level is associated with increased risk of mortality in hospitalized elderly patients with COVID The coronavirus disease    COVID  epidemic is caused by an infection with a novel coronavirus  officially named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus    SARS COV 
The infection spread rapidly on all continents and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization 
As of April       documented cases were reported worldwide  and   patients had died 
As there are currently no specific treatments and medications against the new virus  it is crucial to identify risk factors of severe prognosis Older patients have poorer prognostic factors and are more likely to experience critical disease 
 
 
Based on recent statistical data of China  among patients who were   years and older  the mortality rate was   which was significantly higher than that of younger patients at  
The proportion of deaths over   years old accounts for   of the total deaths in the national wide  which implicates aged people are more vulnerable to the SARS CoV 
Till present there are rare reports in literature focusing on the risk factors for poor outcomes of the elderly patients with COVID Serum prealbumin  known as transthyretin  its levels may be lowered not only by malnutrition  but also by inflammation and aging 
 
 
Compared to albumin  prealbumin has a shorter half life  a more rapid rate of hepatic synthesis  and predictable catabolic rate  hence  it may be a more sensitive indicator 
However  whether prealbumin could be an independent predictor of mortality in hospitalized COVID  elderly patients needs to be further elucidated The present study aims to describe the clinical characteristics and to investigate whether the prealbumin can serve as a valuable predictor of in hospital mortality  which might provide evidence for the risk stratification in elderly and help to improve the clinical practice and reduce fatality We designed this study as a retrospective cohort study design 
The elderly patients with COVID  who were admitted to Tongji Hospital in Wuhan from January   to February     were consecutively included 
This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Tongji Hospital  Approval Number  TJ IRB  and was complied with the Declaration of Helsinki 
The data were anonymous and the study was observational  so the informed consent was not gathered 
A flow diagram illustrating patient selection was described in Figure  
 
Inclusion criteria included elderly patients  ≥   years old  diagnosed with COVID  infection 
A total of   participants have been obtained 
Patients having missing baseline or outcome data  died on admission or being transferred to other designated hospitals during hospitalization were excluded 
There were   patients were included in the final analyses Data collection of participants was performed using hospital electronic medical record system 
Information included medical history  demographic data  physical examination  and hematological  biochemical  radiological and microbiological evaluation results were reviewed 
The data collection forms were reviewed independently by   researchers  CL and LYY 
Blood examinations were assessed at the central laboratory of Tongji Hospital following standard operative procedures 
The routine blood test was analyzed using Sysmex XE  hematology analyzer  Sysmex  Kobe  Japan 
The Cobas C   Roche  Mannheim  Germany  was used to measure the biochemical parameters 
Coagulation tests were detected by STA R MAX coagulation analyzer  Diagnostica Stago  Saint Denis  France 
Throat swab samples were collected and were tested for SARS CoV  with commercial real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  RT PCR  kit from DAAN GENE  Guangzhou  China 
The diagnostic criteria and all clinical procedures in this study followed  Diagnosis and Treatment of Pneumonia Caused by New Coronavirus  Trial version   to   promulgated by the National Health and Health Commission of China Summary statistics of baseline characteristics of all patients and stratification by prealbumin tertiles were expressed as frequency and proportion for categorical variables  mean   standard deviation  SD   Gaussian distribution  or median  range   Skewed distribution  for continuous variables  and as percentages for categorical variables 
The differences between groups were analyzed using the χ   categorical variables  One Way ANOVA test  normal distribution  or Kruskal Whallis H test  skewed distribution We examined the relationship of the prealbumin as categorized into tertiles with the outcomes of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation 
Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to evaluate these relationships  then unadjusted and adjusted odds ratio  ORs  and   confidence intervals  CIs  were calculated 
Model   is the minimally adjusted model with only sociodemographic variables adjusted 
Model   is the fully adjusted model with covariates including age  sex  smoking status  history of hypertension  history of coronary heart disease  history of diabetes  history of chronic kidney disease  history of carcinoma  history of chronic liver disease  neutrophil  lymphocyte  prothrombin time  activated partial thromboplastin time  d dimer  alanine transaminase  aspartate aminotransferase  total bilirubin  blood urea nitrogen  creatinine  C reactive protein and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio 
We calculated odds ratio  ORs  and   confidence intervals  CIs 
The highest tertile was the reference for prealbumin 
We performed test for linear trend by entering the median value of each category of prealbumin tertile as continuous variable to examine the possibility of nonlinearity To ensure the robustness of our results  we also performed stratified analyses with the prealbumin as a continuous variable for the overall population and stratified by gender  age  hypertension status and coronary heart disease status at baseline 
Generalized additive models were used to visually confirm the relationship between prealbumin as continuous variable and the risk of outcomes  all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation Modeling was performed with the statistical software packages R  http www R project org  The R Foundation  and EmpowerStats  http www empowerstats com  X Y Solutions  Inc  Boston  MA 
P values less than    two sided  were considered statistically significant In our study    cases were excluded 
To avoid selection bias due to missing data  we performed a sensitivity analysis 
The results showed that there was no statistical difference between missing group and non missing group  supplemental table  Of   elderly inpatients included in the final analysis  the mean age was     years  ranging from   years to   years  and most patients were male  table  
 
The baseline characteristics of these included participants were listed in table 
The day of sample drawing after admission was       day 
No significant statistical difference in sex  smoking status  body weight  BMI  comorbidity  hypertension  coronary heart disease  chronic kidney disease  cerebral vascular disease  carcinoma  chronic liver disease  symptoms  fever  cough  headache  diarrhea and myalgia fatigue at admission  were detected across different groups of prealbumin  tertile 
When compared with subjects in the highest tertile  those in the lowest tertile were older  more likely to have diabetes medical history  with higher Neutrophil count  lower lymphocyte count  worse coagulation function and liver function 
A total of     patients required mechanical ventilation      patients admitted to intensive care unit and     patients died during hospitalization 
The incidence of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation were significantly decreased across prealbumin tertiles  all cause death    vs    vs    for tertile   vs  tertile   vs  tertile   ICU admission    vs    vs    for tertile   vs  tertile   vs  tertile   mechanical ventilation    vs    vs    for tertile   vs  tertile   vs  tertile   respectively To investigate the correlation between prealbumin and in hospital outcomes  we constructed three models using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models  table  
 
In the unadjusted model  the ORs of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation was significantly increased as the prealbumin tertiles downgraded 
The OR for tertile   was significantly higher than the OR for tertile    OR       CI    to   P   for all cause death  OR       CI    to   P   for ICU admission  OR       CI    to   P   for mechanical ventilation 
Additional adjustment for the demographic variables and comorbidities did not reduce the ORs for the association between prealbumin tertiles and in hospital outcomes 
Further adjusting for the baseline levels of blood examinations  including blood routine  neutrophil  lymphocyte  neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio  coagulation function  prothrombin time  activated partial thromboplastin time  d dimer  liver fuction  alanine transaminase  aspartate aminotransferase  total bilirubin  renal function  blood urea nitrogen  creatinine  and infection indicators  C reactive protein  did not affect the relationships in the fully adjusted models  OR       CI    to   P   for all cause death  OR       CI    to   P   for ICU admission  OR       CI    to   P     for mechanical ventilation 
Therefore  lower tertile of prealbumin exhibited an increased risk of worse in hospital outcomes  full adjusted P for trend for all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation  P     P   and P     respectively Generalized additive models  Fig  
A through  C  were used to visually assess functional relationships between the prealbumin as continuous variate and the risk of in hospital outcomes 
Serum prealbumin was found to have negative linear relationship with the risk of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation To determine the consistency of the relationship between baseline prealbumin as a continuous variable and in hospital outcomes  we conducted stratified analyses  Table  
 
For each unit increase of prealbumin  the adjusted OR for all cause death was   in males  P     and   in females  P    
The adjusted OR for all cause death for persons less than   years of age was    P     compared with    p     for persons   years and older  P interaction    
For each unit increase of the prealbumin  the OR for all cause death was    P     and    P     for normotensives and hypertensives     P     and    P     for non diabetic and diabetes respectively 
The difference of interaction was not significant between two groups  P interaction         and   stratified for gender  age  hypertention and diabetes respectively 
Moreover  the relationship between baseline prealbumin with ICU admission and mechanical ventilation stratified by gender  age  hypertention and diabetes are consistent In this study  we found that lower serum prealbumin significantly associated with an increased risk of worse outcomes and all cause death during hospitalization 
Patients in the lowest tertile of prealbumin were older  and with higher Neutrophil count  lower lymphocyte count  worse coagulation function and liver function compared with subjects in the highest tertile 
Then we adjusted relevant covariates including age  sex  smoking status  comorbidities  neutrophil  lymphocyte  coagulation function  liver function  renal function and C reactive protein to minimize the potential impact of confounding 
Compared with crude regression analyses  this association still persisted when adjusting for demographic and clinical variables in the multivariable regression analyses 
Moreover  stratified by gender  age  hypertension and diabetes  increased level of serum prealbumin was associated with the decreased risk of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation  which determine the consistency of the relationship between lowest serum prealbumin tertile and the increased risk of worse outcomes in elderly COVID  patients Several previous studies have demonstrated baseline prealbumin change in COVID  patients 
Decreased level of prealbumin was observed among COVID  patients 
Wu C et al investigated   patients with COVID  and observed that prealbumin was associated with the development of ARDS  indicating the potential value of prealbumin level on COVID  clinical ending 
Till date  no report exists on the effect of prealbumin in COVID  elderly patients High proportion of severe to critical cases and high fatality rate were observed in the elderlyCOVID  patients  and rapid disease progress was noted in the dead 
One possible explanation involves the greater potential of seniors to be in a state of inflammation  nutritional deficiency and other complications 
Prealbumin is a globular  non glycosilated protein  synthesized by the liver  and complexed with a retinol binding protein  which acts as a transporter of retinol vitamin A and thyroid hormones 
Low plasma prealbumin level has far back emerged as an earliest laboratory indicator of poor nutritional status 
 
 
In addition  prealbumin are also associated with inflammation 
Previous studies showed that in response to the inflammation  the body responds by synthesizing a large number of cytokines 
These include interleukins and tumor necrosis factors that down regulate  decrease  plasma concentrations of albumin and prealbumin 
 
 
Therefore  assay of serum prealbumin concentration is recommended by some investigators as a screening marker for both malnutrition and inflammation Elderly with low plasma prealbumin levels mean that those people are at greater risk of malnutrition and inflammatory conditions  which may lead to poor prognosis 
Malnutrition is commonly seen in hospitalized patients in both the developed and developing world  especially among elderly patients 
A review of   published studies of acute care patients reported that malnutrition incidence ranged from  –  of hospitalized elderly 
It was found that compared to non famine regions of India  experiencing famine had significantly higher influenza mortality rates during the   Influenza pandemic 
Aging  frailty  and chronic diseases are associated with impaired immune function and are compounded by immune dysregulation from malnutrition 
When immune response is dysregulated  it would result in an excessive inflammation  even death 
In the current COVID  study  it was found that elderly patients have higher levels of white blood cells counts  CRP  inflammatory cytokines and are more likely to experience critical disease than did those younger patients 
 
 This retrospective cohort study included   elderly COVID  patients  until the date of February       of patients required mechanical ventilation    of patients admitted to intensive care unit  and the total in hospital mortality was  
The mortality rate was lower than that reported by wang L et al  among elderly COVID  patients 
This may have been the reason for some patients at the date of February     are still in hospital 
Nevertheless  this would not bias the relationship between prealbumin and in hospital outcomes because of the definite observation time we set previously 
Moreover  Wuhan tongji Hospital as one of the largest third grade Class A hospitals equipped with advanced life support training and equipment may partly account for the moderate mortality The results of this study have several clinical implications and strengths 
A low prealbumin concentration can therefore be regarded primarily as a signal identifying the at risk elderly patient who would suffer worse outcomes and requires careful assessment and monitoring for whom nutritional support and Inflammation detection may be needed as part of the treatment plan 
As observational study was susceptible to various confounders  we adjusted many variables that may affect the relationship between prealbumin and in hospital outcomes to minimize potential confounding 
In addition  we tested the robustness of the results by repeating the analyses in different subgroups of gender  age  history of hypertension and history of diabetes Our study has some limitations 
First  by including patients still in hospital as of J February     the case fatality ratio in our study cannot reflect the true mortality of elderly COVID 
Second  the record of data may be affected by prehospital medication and the time interval between admission and onset 
Third  since all subjects in our study were hospitalized Chinese elderly patients diagnosed with COVID  results of this study might not directly be applied to other ethnicities and age groups In conclusion  this retrospective cohort study revealed that the prealbumin is an independent risk factor for the in hospital mortality in the Chinese COVID  elderly patients 
Nutritional support and Inflammation detection should be careful assessment and monitoring for the elderly patients with low prealbumin concentration

Coping With COVID  Emergency Stress  Secondary Trauma and Self Efficacy in Healthcare and Emergency Workers in ItalyThe coronavirus disease  COVID  or the acute respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus    SARS CoV  began spreading in China at the end of   and  to date  represents an international health emergency without precedents in terms of its health  economic  and organizational effects on people s lives  World Health Organization   
After China  Italy was the first country to be affected by this epidemic  with the first deaths on February     and a rapid increase in the spread of infection and mortality 
COVID  was first detected in Northern Italy  and it then spread  although at different rates of incidence  to the other regions 
It was immediately evident that healthcare and emergency workers were at great risk of contagion and that protection and intervention protocols needed to be introduced in the absence of adequate points of reference because of the exceptional nature of the epidemic  the rate of spread of the infection  the seriousness of patients  health condition  and the mortality index 
The extreme conditions in which health workers have had to work  especially in the most affected regions in Northern Italy  are indicated by the following data from the Italian National Institute of Health   over   doctors died and   other health workers were infected within the general context of the population of   deaths and   infections in a span of   weeks 
It was also clear that the medical staff would experience serious psychological repercussions because of the working conditions as well as the difficulty of having scientific points of reference on care and intervention procedures 
To this must be added the increase in workload  the extension of working hours and  for health workers  the frequent exposure to the suffering and death of their patients 
Therefore  healthcare and emergency workers were subjected to serious psychological as well as physical stress 
Hence  the aim of this study  which was also the aim of a previous study  Vagni et al    is to focus on the similarities and the differences in the stress management of two professional groups healthcare and emergency workers during the acute phase of the pandemic 
Both groups have had to deal with COVID patients as frontline responders and have been exposed to the related risks of infection and psychological consequences  which  to date  have not been examined in detail through a comparative analysis As regards the stress that they experience  the literature clearly explains that healthcare and emergency workers who intervene in emergency situations are exposed to the risk of developing dysfunctional reactions that can be identified at different levels physical and or physiological  e g  psychosomatic disorders  sleep wake cycle alterations  and sense of tiredness  emotional  e g  irritability  nervousness  agitation  anger  low self esteem  and guilt  cognitive  e g  distractibility  sense of ineffectiveness  and negative anticipation of events  and relational  e g  increase in conflicts within emergency teams and or with their organization institution  and social withdrawal and may also develop reactions from secondary trauma  Del Missier et al    Sbattella    Argentero and Setti    Fraccaroli and Balducci    Bellelli and Di Schiena    Walton et al   
Faced with stressful events regarding which they lack previous experience and specific  necessary knowledge  and which cause tension owing to the need for rapid decision timings and a sense of responsibility  emergency workers may experience a sense of decision ineffectiveness 
In fact  emergency situations are characterized by high levels of decisional and operational uncertainty with associated regret and guilt  Del Missier et al   Several studies have highlighted that insufficient instructions and a lack of personal protective equipment  PPE  are important predictors of stress for healthcare and emergency workers in large scale emergencies  Oh et al    Du et al    El Hage et al    Walton et al   
Oh et al 
  highlighted that nurses involved in managing the Middle East respiratory syndrome  MERS  experienced lower levels of stress when the levels of goods supply and hospital training were higher 
Some studies have highlighted that frontline healthcare workers had lower secondary traumatization scores than non frontline health workers and the general public in contrast to the findings of previous research on the SARS outbreak in the same area in Singapore  Chan and Huak   
According to Barleycorn   and Tan et al 
  these results may be due to the dedicated training and psychological support given to healthcare workers after the SARS outbreak and demonstrate the validity of policy strategies for prevention of stress in the psychological health field An analysis of   studies published from January to March   aimed at investigating the stress experience of healthcare workers in facing COVID  shows that health workers experienced symptoms of depression and anxiety related to this stressful experience 
Moreover  the severity of their symptoms was influenced by their age  gender  role  specialization  type of activity performed  and exposure to patients with COVID  however  prevention  resilience  and social support interventions mediated their response to stress  Bohlken et al   
In a review of the literature  Spoorthy   underlined that sociodemographic variables  such as age  gender  profession  and workplace  and psychological variables  such as poor social support and self efficacy  affect the stress level experienced by health workers 
In addition  COVID  emerged as an independent stress risk factor 
Xiao et al 
  found that social support plays a role in reducing the anxiety levels in medical staff and increases their sense of self efficacy According to Walton et al 
  the specific stressors that health workers face in the COVID  emergency are related to the organizational context 
The challenges for medical staff include not only an increased workload but also a fear of infection  the need to work with new protocols that change frequently  and the use of PPE 
In uncontrollable situations such as a pandemic  when specific action protocols are absent and limited resources are available  health workers must make individual decisions with a heavy burden of responsibility that may be contrary to their moral principles 
For example  in the case of COVID  they may have to choose which patients to save because only a few places are available in intensive care 
In this regard  Cai et al 
  showed that for a sample of   healthcare professionals who worked closely with COVID  patients in Hubei  the most stressful factors were the lack of protocols for the treatment of COVID  the scarcity of PPE  the exhausting work shifts  their concern about the risk of infection  and their exposure to the death and suffering of their patients 
They also found that the support of superiors proved to be one of the most important motivational factors for medical staff  and the presence of clear guidelines and effective safety protocols were protective factors against the development of stress  in particular  for females 
Further  Walton et al 
  identified the organizational stressors as the changes in work shifts  the prevalence of night shifts  an excessive workload  staff roles  autonomy  the lack of support from superiors  and the absence of adequate information and clear instructions 
On the basis of these stressors  they estimated that   of the medical staff working on the front line of this pandemic are at risk of developing post traumatic stress disorder  PTSD 
In addition  limited resources  longer shifts  decreased hours of rest  and the occupational risks associated with COVID  exposure have increased the physical and mental fatigue  stress  anxiety  and burnout of these staff members  Sasangohar et al   The loss of a social support network  which can be an important resilience factor  is another risk factor  Ozbay et al   
In the COVID  emergency  healthcare and emergency workers have often experienced a separation from their affective links  either because of the restrictions on social contacts imposed by the lockdown or the fear of spreading the infection to their family members 
To this must be added that although  at first  health workers received unanimous encouragement from the population  later  they also experienced demonstrations of stigma and isolation 
Some studies have shown that being able to resort to their own social support network is a significant protective factor for health workers dealing with this emergency  Cai et al   As Favretto   stated  when individuals experience situations that go beyond their coping strategies  their vulnerability to  and risk of developing  psychopathological reactions increases 
Studies conducted during previous epidemics  such as the SARS  MERS  and Ebola epidemics  converge in detecting how healthcare and emergency workers may experience extremely high levels of stress and even develop secondary traumatic stress or vicarious trauma 
This trauma is defined as an experience of symptoms similar to those found in people with PTSD  such as in emergency nurses working with traumatized patients  Beck   
Figley   defined it as a form of stress that derives from the feelings of empathy experienced when helping traumatized people 
The symptoms may include intrusive recurring thoughts  disturbed sleep  fatigue  physical symptoms  hyperarousal  increased stress response  anxiety  depression  and feeling emotional  Adriaenssens et al   
Wolf et al 
  described how nurses may feel  overwhelmed  and this condition becomes a source of moral distress that triggers feelings of powerlessness  guilt  fear  anger  and frustration The sense of frustration and impotence felt by nurses when they are unable to treat and save a patient has been highlighted as a risk factor for secondary traumatic stress in several studies  Missouridou   
Avoidance and emotional numbing can become tools for self protection from intrusive symptoms that exceed the personal tolerance level  Coetzee and Klopper    Mealer and Jones   
Their frustration obviously intensifies on a patient s death 
The onset of PTSD in the health workers involved in treating MERS was also detected after the acute phase of the emergency was over  highlighting a risk not only in the immediate period but also in the medium term period  Lee et al   In reference to COVID  updated studies conducted on Chinese health workers have already highlighted the strong impact of the epidemic on the psychological health of doctors and nurses 
Some studies have found that healthcare workers have high levels of anxiety  depression  insomnia  and distress  Lai et al    Li et al    Zhu et al   
In particular  female professionals with more than   years of experience and previous psychiatric pathology present more risk factors of developing the symptoms of stress  anxiety  and depression  Lai et al    Zhu et al   
Huang J 
Z  et al 
  studied stress levels during the COVID  emergency in a sample of medical staff 
They found that females showed higher levels of anxiety and PTSD than males did and that the levels were higher for nurses than for doctors 
Moreover  Li et al 
  found that nurses had developed higher levels of vicarious trauma than those of the general population and that nurses who did not work closely with COVID  patients showed a more severe symptomatology  both physical and psychological  compared with their colleagues working on the frontline emergency services 
In Italy  a study conducted on healthcare workers found that doctors and nurses developed high levels of stress and anxiety  greater than those developed by the general population  and that healthcare workers operating in the North  the area of Italy most affected by the virus  showed a more severe symptomatology  Simione and Gnagnarella   
This study also confirmed that females tend to have a greater perception of the risk of infection  which increases their risk of developing the symptoms of anxiety and distress Because of their long  intense exposure to various stressors  it is important to note the nature of the coping strategies used by these healthcare and emergency workers in these situations and their effectiveness in terms of reducing and effectively coping with stress 
Indeed  the effective management of stress levels in the acute emergency phase could reduce the risk of developing long term PTSD or other pathologies  such as anxiety and depression  Fullerton et al    Slottje et al    Argentero and Setti    Sakuma et al    Birinci and Erden    Li et al   
Coping may be defined as a series of cognitive and behavioral efforts to manage specific internal or external issues that test or exceed individual resources  Lazarus and Folkman   
A distinction can be made between problem focused and emotion focused coping strategies 
The former is aimed at modifying and solving the stressful situation through active interventions 
By contrast  emotion focused coping is aimed at managing the emotions connected to the stressful event and regulating affective reactions  such as anxiety and the tension of response to stress  for example  by trying to avoid the threat  denial  or re evaluating it  reappraisal The choice of coping strategies is influenced by the individual s cognitive evaluation of the event  termed secondary evaluation  which involves estimating the resources available and the most effective strategies to deal with the situation  Lazarus and Folkman   
A key element of this assessment is the extent to which the individual can maintain control over the outcome of the situation 
The literature indicates that individuals apply dysfunctional coping when they face an uncontrollable event by responding primarily with a coping strategy focused on the problem  and conversely  when they face a controllable situation  they respond with coping strategies focused on emotions  Strentz and Auerbach    Vitaliano et al   
A coping strategy may be defined as adaptive when the controllability of the stressful event corresponds with the choice of coping strategy  in this case  the subject will experience fewer symptoms related to stress  Park et al   The strategies used to cope with trauma may differ among individuals  but they can also vary according to the profession and the features of the traumatic event  Nydegger et al   
Individuals differ in their choice of coping strategies  Connor Smith and Flachsbart    and factors related to the situation can also have a decisive influence on such choice  Brown et al   
A few studies have considered the ways in which gender influences the perception of stress in emergency situations and the choice of coping strategy 
These studies highlight that females tend to perceive events as more negative and uncontrollable and to resort more to coping strategies focused on emotions and avoidance  whereas males tend to resort more to applying problem focused coping and to inhibiting emotions  Matud    Matud et al    Matud and Garcia   The literature on the relationship between coping strategies and the stress levels of emergency workers has shown that the use of coping strategies focused on the problem usually tends to correlate with lower stress levels  both in healthcare workers  Watson et al    Howlett et al    and in other emergency workers  such as firefighters  Brown et al   
However  a coping strategy frequently used by emergency workers is that of avoidance and minimization  and this strategy is associated with higher levels of stress  Brown et al    Chang et al    Kerai et al    Witt et al    Theleritis et al   
Loo et al 
  found that in a group of emergency workers  avoidance as well as coping strategies focused on emotions were associated with the development of post traumatic symptomatology 
Rodríguez Rey et al 
  revealed that among health workers working in a pediatric emergency department  approximately   of the variance in PTSD was explained by the frequent use of coping strategies focused on emotions and the infrequent use of those focused on the problem 
In addition  Kucmin et al 
  who considered a sample of   paramedics  highlighted that the risk of developing PTSD symptoms was predicted by the use of coping strategies focused on emotions However  the literature does not offer unanimous results 
Chamberlin and Green   found that in a group of firefighters  all coping strategies actually correlated with high levels of stress  the authors explained this finding by suggesting that it is not the individual coping strategies that are maladaptive in themselves  but that greater effort is needed to adjust in stressful situations 
By contrast  Young et al 
  indicated that firefighters use problem focused coping strategies more often at the beginning of the operation and emotion focused coping strategies more commonly in the phase of breakdown and fatigue 
However  after the incident  they use both strategies  Young et al   
A meta analysis by Shin et al 
  highlighted that different coping strategies have different effects on work burnout  in particular  emotional stress and depersonalization are associated with the use of emotion focused coping strategies  whereas professional ineffectiveness is associated with the use of problem focused strategies Further  a few studies have investigated the coping strategies that emergency workers can use during health emergencies similar to COVID 
Maunder et al 
  revealed that healthcare professionals who tended to apply dysfunctional coping strategies  based on avoidance  hostile comparison  or self blame  tended to develop higher stress levels 
Wong et al 
  highlighted that during the SARS epidemic  doctors and nurses tended to use different coping strategies 
The doctors tended to turn more to action planning  but this strategy did not affect their stress level 
Instead  their stress level was positively correlated with their use of coping strategies based on emotional outlets 
By contrast  the nursing staff tended to resort more to behavioral disengagement and distraction strategies  which  however  correlated with higher levels of stress among them In this regard  during the MERS epidemic  hospital staff tended to adopt coping strategies related to the use of PPE and the adoption of all prevention measures  as well as social support  whereas the coping strategy that they adopted the least was that based on an emotional outlet  Khalid et al   
A recent study on healthcare workers in Hubei  China  during the COVID  epidemic  Cai et al    yielded similar results  to reduce stress  the medical staff tended to rely on active coping strategies  such as using security protocols  practicing social isolation measures  and seeking support from family and friends  but they did not find it necessary to discuss their emotions with a professional 
Huang L  et al 
  found that a sample of nurses working during the COVID  emergency presented greater emotional reactions and turned more to problem focused coping compared with university nursing students 
Emergency workers must have sufficient self efficacy in terms of their coping skills to be able to manage and cope with stress levels 
Self efficacy in coping appears to be an effective protective factor in relation to stress levels and maladaptive responses  Chesney et al   
Self efficacy to cope with traumatic events has been effective in reducing the risk of developing PTSD  Bosmans et al   The main objective of this study is to identify the coping strategies activated by healthcare and emergency workers to deal with stress factors related to the COVID  emergency that may be associated with the risk of developing vicarious or secondary trauma 
Few studies have considered both groups simultaneously when analyzing the strategies they have adopted to manage stress during the COVID  emergency 
Hence  in this study  we are interested in detecting the similarities and differences in the approaches they adopted to manage their stress during the acute phase of the current pandemic According to Walton et al 
  the main acute stress reactions of emergency workers to emergency medical situations are emotional  cognitive  physical  and social reactions 
Therefore  these factors were included in the questionnaire used in the present study 
Moreover  reactions linked to stress factors for difficulties due to ineffective decision making and dealing with stress were also considered  Chesney et al   
In addition  fears regarding contracting the virus and infecting their own families because of COVID  were specifically considered  Du et al    Huang J 
Z  et al    Ornell et al    Walton et al   Based on results found in the literature  the specific objectives of this study are as follows Participants were selected on a voluntary basis through a trasversal sampling in order to take a picture of the situation caused by the pandemic emergency 
We used an internet platform to conduct the study and approached the participants using social media  dedicated mailing lists  and forums 
Participants from all Italian regions completed the questionnaire online 
The sample consists of   participants  males   and   females  whose average age was   years  SD     min   – max  
Further    of the sample were married    were separated  and the remaining   were single 
We selected various professional figures who had directly worked in various sectors during the COVID  emergency and who could be divided into two main groups 
The first  the  Health Group  consists of   participants   who were healthcare workers    doctors     nurses     psychologists   and seven healthcare assistants  
Their average age was   years  SD     and their average years of active professional service was    SD    
The second  the  Emergency Group  consists of   participants     emergency workers     firefighters   and   Civil Protection staff   whose average age was   years  SD     and average years of service was    SD    
There was an age difference between the two groups  t     p   and the distribution of the gender variable differed between the two groups  with   males and   females in the Health Group and   males and   females in the Emergency Group  χ    p    
The study involved participants from the entire national territory  and their workplace could be divided as follows      and   were from North  Central  and South Italy  respectively 
Further    of the sample worked directly with COVID  patients and   worked in specific COVID  departments 
Among the healthcare workers    had worked in direct contact with COVID  patients  whereas among the emergency workers  only   had assisted these patients  χ    p    
In the present study  we included two variables  lack of necessary instructions and lack of PPE  in accordance with the findings in the literature on their impact on the stress reactions of healthcare and emergency workers during the COVID  pandemic 
Among the participants    and   of healthcare and emergency workers  respectively  did not have sufficient instructions to intervene  χ    p n s 
  and   and   of healthcare and emergency workers  respectively  lacked adequate PPE when working  χ    p n s 
 This study used an online questionnaire and was conducted during the lockdown period owing to the COVID  pandemic 
The questionnaire had three parts  one each to collect online informed consent and baseline sociodemographic information  and one with an online series of questionnaires  as described in the next section 
Participants  anonymity was maintained in collecting the data 
The institutional Ethics Committee approved all the procedures This instrument s   items enable verification of the presence of two symptoms of vicarious trauma  Intrusion and Arousal  and their relative frequency 
The STSS was built on the basis of the conceptualization expressed in the DSM   American Psychiatric Association    regarding the characteristic PTSD symptoms 
In detail  the Arousal items describe situations characterized by anxiety  confusion  physical and psychological complaints  and agitation 
Intrusion refers to the re experiencing of the traumatic event even if not directly suffered through internal images and memories 
Instructions for the STSS I indicated that respondents should specify how frequently an item was true for them in the previous   weeks 
The statements are evaluated on a  point scale     never      very often  that provides scores for Intrusion  example items   I thought about my work with victims when I didn t intend to   Reminders of my work with clients upset me  and Arousal  example items   I had trouble concentrating   I was easily annoyed   I expected something bad to happen   I felt jumpy 
The reliability coefficients of the instrument are   and   for Arousal and Intrusion  respectively This is a  item measure of perceived self efficacy for coping with challenges and threats 
This measure focuses on the changes in individuals  confidence in their ability to cope effectively  based on the self efficacy theory  Bandura    Chesney et al   
Participants were asked   When things aren t going well for you  or when you re having problems  how confident or certain are you that you can do the following  Then  they were asked to rate on an  point scale the extent to which they believed they could perform important behaviors for adaptive coping 
The instrument yields three subscale scores   problem focused coping   α      stop unpleasant emotions and thoughts   α     and  support   α    
Anchor points on the scale are    cannot do at all     moderately certain can do  and    certain can do We constructed an ad hoc  item questionnaire that included Yes No questions to detect stress factors identified by the literature  such as the availability of suitable equipment and the receipt of clear instructions during the COVID  coping experience 
In this study  we present the results related to two of these items   Instructions  which refers to having received the necessary instructions to intervene  and  Equipment  which refers to having PPE 
Predictions of these factors have also been made in other studies  Du et al    Walton et al   
In light of the relevance and specificity of the lack of clear information or instructions and adequate PPE in the management of COVID  in the Italian context  as well as the findings in other studies  we decided to focus attention on these two risk factors Our analysis of the literature revealed that in situations in which they have to cope with a pandemic  several factors may affect the stress of medical staff and emergency healthcare workers and that COVID  represents an independent specific stressor  Spoorthy   
These stress factors have been identified as frequently affecting healthcare and emergency workers in emergency situations and leading to physical  emotional  cognitive  decision making  relational  and organizational stress  Del Missier et al    Sbattella    Argentero and Setti    Fraccaroli and Balducci    Bellelli and Di Schiena    Du et al    Walton et al   
Focusing on the specificity of the COVID  epidemic  items have been constructed regarding the fears of contracting the infection and of infecting colleagues or family members  Walton et al    since COVID  represents a factor of independent stress  Spoorthy    that has great impact  Huang J 
Z  et al   
Consequently  we constructed the ESQ consisting of   items assessed on a  point Likert scale  with scores ranging from    not at all  to    very much  grouped into six scales 
The participants were asked to indicate how often they experienced certain emotions and thoughts while performing intervention and emergency activities during the COVID  pandemic The scales correspond to the factors identified and confirmed by factorial analysis through an analysis of the main components with orthogonal rotation of factors  varimax 
The number of factors to be extracted was initially verified through the unit s largest eigenvalue criterion and  subsequently  by the scree test 
The ESQ is based on six scales The ESQ demonstrated good internal consistency  α     overall and for each individual scale  Organizational–Relational Stress  α     Physical Stress  α     Inefficacy Decisional Stress  α     Emotional Stress  α     Cognitive stress  α     and COVID  Stress  α    First  we performed Pearson s correlation analyses to identify the associations between the variables for the two groups that we considered in this study 
Subsequently  we checked for significant differences between the two groups as their stress levels  coping strategies  and secondary trauma 
We used hierarchical linear regression models to verify the predictive effect of the risk factors  lack of adequate information and PPE  on the different stress levels  in step  
Then  we verified the protective effect of the coping strategies  in step  
The models were controlled for age  gender  and group 
Lastly  we used hierarchical regression models to verify the predictive effect of stress factors on the components of secondary trauma 
The models were controlled for age  gender  and group First  we conducted correlational analyses and comparisons of averages on the reference sample 
Table   shows the correlations between the scales of the ESQ and the other instruments Preliminary comparisons were made through the Student s t test between the Health Group and the Emergency Group in relation to the ESQ  CSES SF  and STSS I scores 
Table   shows the comparison between the two groups As shown in Table   significant differences emerged between the two groups in relation to their Stress and Arousal levels 
The results indicate higher levels of both for the Health Group  and that emergency workers turn more to the Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts strategy 
Further  we performed comparisons with reference to the gender variable to detect differences in the levels of stress factors  coping strategies  and secondary trauma 
Females reported significantly higher Physical Stress than males did  Females  M     SD     Males  M     SD     t     p     as well as Emotional Stress  Females  M     SD     Males  M     SD     t     p     and COVID  Stress  Females  M     SD     Males  M     SD     t     p    
No gender difference emerged in coping strategies and secondary trauma 
Within the Health Group  there were significant differences regarding Inefficacy Decisional Stress  F     p     Doctor M     SD     Psychologist M     SD     average difference     p     and COVID  Stress  F     p     Nurse M     SD     Doctor M     SD     difference     p    
Within the Emergency Group  there were no differences in levels of stress and secondary trauma or coping strategies 
Moreover  we found similar correlations between the two groups for the Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts strategy and the stress factors  whereas for the other two coping strategies  we found a different association  particularly for the Emergency Group 
However  the t test comparisons highlight differences only at the level of the Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts strategy 
Given the findings of the preliminary analyses  we considered it necessary to include the age  gender  and group variables to test the predictiveness of the coping strategies on the participants  stress levels To test the predictive effect of the coping strategies on various levels of stress  hierarchical regression was conducted 
Considering the Age and Gender differences within the groups  we included these variables in all models together with the Group variable  Health vs 
Emergency  and the  Instructions  and  Equipment  variables 
The models generated by assuming the ESQ scales as dependent variables are shown in Table  
Regarding the coping strategies  we observed an important effect of the Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts Coping strategy on all the stress scales  except for Physical Stress where the effect of the Focused Problem Coping strategy is recorded As shown in Table   significant negative associations between stressors and secondary trauma were found for both groups 
The hierarchical regression models of stress scales were analyzed for the Arousal and Intrusion levels of secondary trauma 
The models included the Age  Gender  Health Emergency Group variables  and the ESQ scales 
The results are shown in Table  The same regression models were generated by including coping strategies as predictors and were analyzed by Age  Gender  and Health Emergency Group 
Compared with Arousal  the Health Emergency Group and Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts are predictive  R    F     p     Beta  ∗∗∗  Beta  ∗  respectively 
Compared with Intrusion  only the Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts variable  R    F     p     Beta  ∗  assumes significance This study has several limitations 
The first is the limited sample size 
The second is that our study involved participants in the very midst of the COVID  emergency  which means that the level of stress in healthcare workers may have been more severe and acute 
Moreover  the long term psychological implications for the healthcare and emergency population should be investigated for the presence of a full secondary trauma 
Therefore  a large sized longitudinal study is called for to further explore the pathogenesis of vicarious traumatization 
The third is that participants were not selected based on whether they had existing psychological problems 
In proposing the hypothesis of this study  we anticipated that we would be able to discover the relationships between coping strategies  emergency related stress  and secondary trauma in healthcare and emergency workers and commenced our investigation by assuming that the impact of stress can provoke psychological consequences in emergency situations 
In future work  this assumption could be tested to verify whether an emergency situation has a different impact on workers who have already experienced psychological problems The raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors  without undue reservation  to any qualified researcher The studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by Comitato Etico per la Sperimentazione Umana – CESU of the University of Urbino

As reported by some  the association of acute kidney injury  AKI  and COVID  has a high mortality   
However  the incidence of reported AKI associated with COVID  varies widely             
It would be expected that kidney involvement is frequent since the virus enters the cell through the angiotensin converting enzyme    ACE  which is expressed  in addition to pulmonary type   alveolar cells  on renal proximal tubular cells  glomerular visceral and parietal epithelium  and the cytoplasm of the distal tubules and collecting ducts         
In addition  COVID  induces hemodynamic instability and severe inflammation  which  in addition to direct renal infection  can induce acute tubular necrosis  ATN 
We report our experience with AKI in COVID  patients in an inner city  predominantly minority  and a low socioeconomic group and compare our experience with other studies in significantly different cohorts of patients 
We identify the incidence  risk factors  and prognosis of AKI and thus provide a broader understanding of this complication in a group of patients not specifically reported upon to date All adult patients   years of age admitted to the Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center with COVID  infection from March   through April     were studied in this retrospective analysis done in a single medical center serving a low income minority population in Brooklyn  NY 
It was one of the single centers with the most admissions of COVID  patients 
COVID  infection was diagnosed based on clinical presentation  radiographic lung abnormalities  and a positive result of real time PCR 
We excluded COVID  patients from our study if they were on maintenance hemodialysis or were renal transplant recipients 
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Brookdale Hospital and did not require patient consent because of its retrospective design We collected the demographics  the presenting clinical symptoms when available  prior medical history including outpatient medications and prior level of renal function  comorbidities  and in hospital laboratory data from the electronic medical record  Epic Hyperspace   
Laboratory data consisted of complete blood count  hemostasis parameters  renal and liver function  PF ratio  arterial oxygen partial pressure  PaO  fractional inspired oxygen  FiO   creatinine kinase  lactate dehydrogenase  and inflammatory markers including high sensitivity C reactive protein  hs CRP  ferritin  and D dimer 
Normal range of these measures was provided by our laboratory The Kidney Disease  Improving Global Outcome  KDIGO    definition was used to identify AKI 
Estimated glomerular filtration rate  eGFR  on admission was taken as baseline eGFR and was divided into   and ≥  mL min  m 
eGFR was estimated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study  MDRD  equation 
The earliest day of the serum creatinine change that met the KDIGO criteria for AKI was selected as day   of AKI 
The peak serum creatinine value was used to determine the stage of AKI  with an increase in the serum creatinine of  –   –  and   times the baseline serum creatinine defined as AKI stages     and   respectively Continuous variables were described as mean   standard deviation for normally distributed data  or median and interquartile range  IQR  values for non normal distribution 
Categorical variables were presented as frequency and percentage 
The mean of continuous variables was compared by using independent t tests  the Wilcoxon rank sum test  and the Kruskal Wallis test  across the stages of AKI 
The proportion of categorical variables was compared by using χ  test 
Fischer s exact test was used when there were only limited data available 
The Kaplan Meier method  log rank test  was used to determine the cumulative incidence of in hospital mortality 
We used the Cox proportional hazard  PH  regression to determine the association of kidney disease indicators and in hospital mortality 
The assumptions of the Cox PH model were checked using the Schoenfeld residuals  and no violations of the assumptions were present 
In the multivariable analysis  separate Cox PH models were used to determine the association of baseline eGFR and blood urea nitrogen  BUN  on admission  proteinuria  hematuria  and stages of AKI with in hospital mortality since these variables showed a highly significant correlation 
Variables for Cox PH regression were selected using stepwise regression 
Variables with α level of risk factor   were entered into the model 
While evaluating the association of hematuria and proteinuria with in hospital mortality by the Cox PH model  patients with missing values  n     were excluded from the analysis 
All statistical analyses were performed using the STATA version   software and a p value of   was used to determine statistical significance In this study    adult confirmed cases of COVID  were initially reviewed 
Patients on maintenance hemodialysis  n     were excluded from the study and   patients were used for the analysis 
Baseline characteristics of these patients are shown in Table  
  of our cohort were African Americans and   were Hispanics 
The median age of the patients was   years  IQR  –  and   of them were male 
Most of these patients presented with dyspnea   cough   and fever  
  of the patients had a systolic blood pressure below   mm Hg at presentation 
   n     of all patients were mechanically ventilated during the hospitalization 
The median values of ferritin  D dimer  hs CRP  creatinine kinase and lactose dehydrogenase were elevated above their reference ranges  see online suppl

The development of AKI was seen earlier in the course in patients with an eGFR   mL min  m  at presentation   vs    and occurred within   h of admission 
Patients who developed AKI during the hospitalization were more likely to have a systolic blood pressure of   mm Hg at presentation and a lesser PF ratio and were more likely to be intubated during the course of hospitalization  Table  
Eighteen out of   patients with documented chronic kidney disease  CKD  prior to admission developed AKI during the hospitalization

Table  The number of patients requiring renal replacement therapy  RRT  during the hospitalization was  
This represented   of all patients and   of those with AKI 
All the patients who required RRT by definition had stage   AKI 
The modalities of RRT were continuous RRT in   patients   of all those who required RRT  and intermittent hemodialysis in   patients  
Two patients   required both modalities of RRT 
    out of   of those patients who required mechanical ventilation developed AKI compared with     out of   of nonventilated patients 
Of these   patients      required RRT 
The majority of AKI stage   patients requiring RRT were on mechanical ventilation   out of   requiring RRT

The in hospital mortality was significantly higher in patients with an eGFR   mL min  m    than in patients with an eGFR ≥  mL min  m    at presentation 
The in hospital mortality of AKI patients was     out of   who developed AKI died   Table  A significantly higher in hospital mortality was observed in patients with an eGFR   mL min  m  at presentation  elevated BUN at presentation  and in hospital AKI using the Kaplan Meier analysis  Fig

In a multivariable Cox PH model  adjusted for age  gender  PF ratio  hemodynamic status  and comorbidities  diabetes  HTN  hyperlipidemia  cancer  and stroke  eGFR   mL min  m  at presentation  BUN on admission  and AKI greater than or equal to stage   was associated with a higher risk of in hospital mortality 
There was no significant association between in hospital mortality and proteinuria and or hematuria  Table  AKI is common among hospitalized patients  incidence  –  and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality       
In our cohort of   COVID  patients  a relatively higher percentage of patients     of   developed in hospital AKI 
Current evidence suggests that AKI in COVID  patients is a result of an interplay of virus mediated injury  a dysregulated inflammatory response  angiotensin II pathway activation  hypercoagulation  and microangiopathy   
These COVID specific factors likely interact with the other known risk factors for AKI  such as hemodynamic instability  hypoxia  and sepsis  which increased over time 
The increase in the cumulative incidence of AKI over time in our cohort is likely associated with concomitant clinical deterioration and less likely represent a unique renal effect of COVID 
Compared to studies of AKI in COVID  patients from other countries  we found our incidence to be higher than that reported from   Asian countries  –  and is similar to that in an Italian study             
However  it is lower than that in the more recent report by Hirsch et al 
  who detailed their experience in   academic and community hospitals in metropolitan New York   none of which are located in the inner city  lower socioeconomic neighborhoods with a predominant minority population 
As compared with the above cited studies  the incidence of stage   AKI   was highest in our cohort 
It is not possible to determine with certainty the cause s  of this wide variation 
However  we did note a higher prevalence of comorbid conditions in our group 
For example  Cheng et al 
  reported a   incidence of AKI  with a   prevalence of HTN and a   prevalence of DM in their study population 
In our cohort  roughly twice as many   had HTN  and more than   times as many   were diabetic  Table  
Also  the incidence of severe lung involvement that required mechanical ventilation was lower   than ours    Table  
Mechanical ventilation per se has been reported to be strongly associated with AKI   
In our cohort  the incidence of AKI was also higher among those requiring mechanical ventilation  We identified various risk factors for AKI in our study  Tables    
Similar to previous reports  our patients with AKI were more likely to be male  have a history of HTN  and have severe respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation     
In our study  higher BMI increased the likelihood of developing severe AKI 
A low eGFR at presentation more than doubled the risk of developing AKI  p      Table  
Patients with lower eGFR had a significantly higher cumulative incidence of AKI than those with eGFR   mL min  m   p     Fig 
 
Thus  there was a synergistic effect of reduced baseline kidney function and subsequent AKI 
We did not find an association between diabetes and in hospital AKI The role of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors  ACEi  in COVID  is a subject of ongoing debate 
ACEi can increase the expression of ACE  the receptor used by SARS CoV  to enter target cells     
However  ACE  has been shown to be beneficial in acute respiratory distress syndrome when replaced     
This possible protective effect is attributed to the degradation of proinflammatory angiotensin II to angiotensin by ACE 
At present  it remains unclear if ACEi facilitate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus    SARS CoV  cellular entry and intracellular virus replication and whether ACEi improve acute respiratory distress syndrome outcomes 
In our cohort  the use of ACEi was significantly higher in patients with a lower admitting eGFR  Table   and in those who experienced AKI  Table  
We found a similar association between AKI and non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs  but not with angiotensin II receptor blockers  ARBs  in our cohort  Table  
Further studies are necessary to delineate the relationship between ACEi  angiotensin II receptor blockers  and COVID  outcomes Markers of acute inflammation  ferritin and CRP  muscle injury  creatinine kinase  myocardial injury  and D dimer levels were significantly higher in patients with a low eGFR at presentation  online suppl 
Table   and in those with AKI  online suppl 
Table   suggesting causality by a dysregulated immune inflammatory response  the so called  cytokine storm We found an extremely high incidence of mortality in our study cohort 
High presenting BUN and low eGFR   mL min  m  were significantly associated with increased mortality  Table  
AKI was significantly associated with increased mortality 
The mortality risk was highest in stage   AKI  HR   CI  –   Table  
Mortality was   in the AKI group and   in the non AKI group  p    
Mortality rose concurrently with the AKI stages      and   for stages     and   respectively  Table  
These rates were over   and  fold higher than those reported by Hirsch et al 
    AKI    in non AKI 
However  our cohort s high mortality is similar to the findings of John Hopkins University and the American Community Survey 
They reported a   and  fold higher COVID  infection and mortality rate in predominantly African American counties than in predominantly white counties   
Wadhera et al 
  also reported a death rate of   per   in Brooklyn  about   higher than that of Manhattan 
Moreover  in New York City  current age adjusted mortality is highest among African Americans and about   times that of whites   Our hospital provides medical services for an ethnic minority and a low income population in the most impoverished neighborhood in Brooklyn  where   of the residents live below the Federal Poverty Level as per a   report   
  of our patients identified themselves as African Americans 
In comparison  in the study by Hirsch et al 
     identified themselves as whites  and only   identified themselves as African Americans 
The high representation of ethnic minorities in our study population may have contributed to the increased mortality 
This association has been widely publicized and is likely the result of a complex interplay of multiple factors 
These include  but are not limited to  a high burden of comorbidities  genetics  the pernicious influence of adverse socioeconomic determinants of health  the absence of the privilege to work from home  and the ability to follow the recommended social distancing   In our cohort      of the   patients with AKI required RRT 
Nineteen out of these   patients   were mechanically ventilated 
Thus  almost all of the additional requirements for acute dialysis during the COVID  pandemic at our institution were in intensive care units 
Overall      out of   of mechanically ventilated patients required RRT 
Elevated ferritin was associated with an increased risk of all stages of AKI and the need for RRT  online suppl 
Table  
Among those who received RRT      died versus     in the stage   AKI group who did not undergo RRT  p      Table  
Thus  there was no statistically significant improvement in survival  and the mortality remained extremely high in both the RRT and non RRT groups 
These findings should prompt the early involvement of a palliative care team to define goals of care in patients with COVID  disease and stage   AKI In our experience  ultrafiltration was not well tolerated 
It often increased pressor requirements and did little to improve the ventilatory status 
We observed a high incidence of hypercoagulability and frequent clotting of the dialysis filters  lines  and catheters 
Thus  the patients required higher than the usual doses of heparin Our study has limitations 
Although     of the study population had a low eGFR on admission  only     had a documented history of CKD 
Data were collected retrospectively from medical records and often did not have information regarding prior renal function 
Patients also may have had an elevated creatinine on admission secondary to AKI suffered prior to hospitalization 
If so  we may have underestimated the true overall incidence of COVID associated AKI 
It is not possible to rectify this problem  given the data at our disposal Our study is a single center study  with the majority of the study population identifying themselves as African Americans or Hispanics 
This limits our study s general applicability but provides a unique insight into this population and broadens our understanding of COVID  disease 
Data were missing on many patients at different stages of the hospitalization since they were collected retrospectively 
Importantly  little data were available regarding urine output  a defining characteristic of AKI 
With this lack of information  we may have again underestimated the true incidence of AKI Nevertheless  even with the above limitations of our study  the high incidence of AKI and its negative impact upon survival is abundantly clear 
In response to the high incidence of AKI in our patients with COVID  we increased our capacity to deliver RRT 
These efforts included the purchase of additional machines and dialysis solutions  additional staff training  and engineering alterations to allow dialysis on the general medical floors 
Also  we increased our stockpiles of catheters  filters  and dialysis solutions for intermittent and continuous RRT 
We also plan to establish a peritoneal dialysis program to further strengthen our acute dialysis capacity In conclusion  our data report explicitly upon a high proportion of ethnic minority patients in an inner city  severely economically deprived neighborhood  previously not studied 
Our patients experienced a high incidence of AKI and an extremely high mortality  especially in AKI stage  
Unfortunately  RRT provided little survival benefit

  supervisor Dynamic changes in computed tomography manifestations of   patients
with novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan  ChinaDuring the first week of December   a few cases of pneumonia caused by a novel
coronavirus appeared in Wuhan  Hubei Province  China 
The patients had a history of
visiting the nearby Huanan seafood market  where wild animals were sold  With the spread of the disease  such cases have also been found in other
parts of China and abroad 
As of   July     cases have been confirmed
worldwide  including   deaths and   recoveries The novel coronavirus was originally named   novel coronavirus  nCoV  it was
recently officially renamed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus  
 SARS CoV  by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses 
The disease
caused by SARS CoV  has been named coronavirus disease    COVID  by the World
Health Organization 
Like SARS CoV  SARS CoV  likely originated in bats  however 
the intermediary animal host remains unclear 
The nearest neighbor of the  nCoV
isolates from China is a bat SARS like coronavirus  Bat SL CoVZC SARS CoV  carries a high risk of human to human transmission  and such transmission
has been reported in family clusters and among medical workers  The main route of transmission
is respiratory droplets and contact transmission  the virus may also be transmitted
through the conjunctiva and via aerosols  Current epidemiological surveys indicate that the latency period generally
ranges from   to   days  with a maximum of   days 
Affected patients present with
pneumonia like symptoms  including fever  fatigue  cough  expectoration 
pharyngalgia  anorexia  and myalgia 
Some patients also have gastrointestinal
symptoms  including diarrhea  nausea  vomiting  and abdominal pain 
In severe cases 
patients may rapidly develop acute respiratory distress syndrome  septic shock 
difficult to correct metabolic acidosis  and coagulation dysfunction Increasing numbers of studies are suggesting the high clinical value of imaging
examinations  especially high resolution computed tomography  HRCT  of the chest  in
patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia –  Typical CT imaging
manifestations include multiple patchy subsegmental or segmental ground glass
opacities  GGOs  and consolidation in the bilateral lungs  The imaging manifestations in patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia often
change rapidly  and many patients thus undergo repeated CT examinations 
Some
patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia gradually improve  whereas others develop
persistent hypoxemia or dyspnea and gradually worsen 
The changes in the patient s
condition are often closely related to the severity of the lung lesions 
Therefore 
observing the evolution of the lung lesions by chest CT is very important to assess
and predict the patient s outcome This study was to performed observe the changes in the chest HRCT manifestations of
  patients with pneumonia caused by SARS CoV  from the time of the initial
diagnosis 
To our knowledge  this is the largest population evaluated to date among
studies of the dynamic changes in imaging manifestations of novel coronavirus
pneumonia Consecutive patients were retrospectively enrolled in this single center study
from   January   to   February  
These patients met the Diagnosis and
Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia  trial version   issued by the National
Health Commission of the People s Republic of China  and their diagnoses were confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction 
According to the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus
Pneumonia  trial version   issued by the Chinese National Health Committee 
patients who developed severe pneumonia during their disease course were
excluded 
Severe pneumonia was defined as severe respiratory distress
 respiratory rate of   breaths minute  a requirement for oxygen treatment
or mechanical ventilation  an oxygen saturation of   on room air  a
partial arterial oxygen pressure fraction of inspired oxygen ratio of ≤  mmHg 
shock  or pneumonia combined with other organ failure All patients were examined using a Discovery CT  HD scanner  GE Healthcare 
Chicago  IL  USA  during a single inspiratory phase 
Before the examination  the
medical staff guided the patient to hold his or her breath and inhale 
After
complete exhalation  the patient held his or her breath  and a CT scan was
performed from the bottom of the lung to the apex of the lung 
The tube voltage
was   kVp with automatic tube current modulation 
The scan time was   s  the
scan interval was   mm  and the scan layer thickness was   mm 
After scanning 
adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction of   and the standard algorithm
were adopted  and the reconstruction layer thickness was   mm 
No contrast
agent was used during the CT scan 
Most patients underwent multiple chest CT
examinations  largely because the clinicians were still unclear about the
evolution tendencies of the lung lesions associated with COVID  pneumonia 
Additionally  some patients had symptoms such as hypoxemia or dyspnea due to
rapid disease progression 
Therefore  multiple chest CT examinations were
required to observe the progress or absorption of pneumonia The major CT manifestations were described using internationally standard
nomenclature defined by the Fleischner Society glossary  using terms such as
GGO  consolidation  and fibrous strips  A semi quantitative scoring system was used to estimate the pulmonary
involvement of all of these abnormalities on the basis of the area involved  Each of the five lung lobes was visually scored from   to   as follows 
  no involvement      involvement      to   involvement      to
  involvement      to   involvement  and     involvement 
The
total CT score was the sum of the individual lobar scores and ranged from    no
involvement  to    maximum involvement 
The number of affected lung lobes was
also recorded 
The images were transferred to an AW  workstation  GE
Healthcare  and anonymized 
All images were evaluated by two radiologists with
more than   years of work experience  and the final scores were determined by
consensus Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS Statistics for Windows  Version
   SPSS Inc  Chicago  IL  USA 
Measurement data are expressed as
mean   standard deviation  minimum–maximum  and categorical data are presented
as the percentage of the group 
A P value of   was defined as
statistically significant In total    CT scans of   patients   men    women  with confirmed COVID 
were collected 
The patients  ages ranged from   to   years  and their mean
age was       years 
Fever was the most common symptom  Table  
The patients
underwent        –  chest CT examinations  and the interval between the
first and last scan was       days  –  days The laboratory results are presented in Table  
Most laboratory results were
normal  with mildly elevated concentrations of C reactive protein
      mg L  D dimers       mg L  and ferritin      
µg L Based on clinical experience  five stages were identified from the onset of
initial symptoms  Stage A  –  days  n     Stage B  –  days  n     Stage
C  –  days  n     Stage D  –  days  n     and Stage E   days 
n    
One patient had a  day history of cough with fever and was in Stage B
at the time of admission 
The frequencies of different lesions in different
stages are presented in Table  
Two patients in Stage A and one patient in Stage E had no
lesions 
Multiple lobes were involved in most of the CT scans in all stages 
Multiple lobe involvement was present in     patients in Stage A   
  in Stage B      in Stage C      in Stage D  and    
in Stage E  GGOs could be seen in all stages  and the proportion of GGOs in each
stage was similar 
The proportion of consolidation first increased and then
decreased over time 
GGOs and consolidation were present in     and  
  patients in Stage A      and     in Stage B     
and     in Stage C      and     in Stage D  and    
and     in Stage E  respectively 
The consolidations in some cases were
absorbed As shown in Table  
the total CT score also first increased and then decreased over time  and the
total CT score of pulmonary involvement was significantly higher in Stage B than
in Stage A       vs        respectively  P    
Additionally  the
total CT score of lung involvement was significantly higher in Stage C than in
Stages B and D       vs         P     and       vs       
 P     respectively 
The number of involved lobes was significantly higher
in Stage B than in Stage A       vs        respectively  P    
Notably  the CT score of the lower lobe was significantly higher than the
corresponding upper and middle lobes in Stages A  B  C  and D  P     for
all 
In Stage E  the CT score of the right lower lobe was significantly higher
than that of the right upper middle lobes  P     and P    
respectively  whereas no significant difference was observed in the CT score
between the left lower lobe and left upper lobe The CT images of a patient with novel coronavirus pneumonia are shown in Figure  
GGOs and
consolidation first increased from Stage A to Stage C  after which the
consolidation gradually absorbed  the GGOs then gradually decreased in Stages D
and E Since the end of   an outbreak of a novel pneumonia in Wuhan has been drawing
tremendous attention around the world 
Chinese government officials and researchers
have taken swift measures to control the outbreak and conduct etiological studies 
The causative agent of this pneumonia has been identified as SARS CoV  a novel
coronavirus 
As its name suggests  its genetic structure is   similar to that of SARS CoV The most frequently affected organ of the novel coronavirus is the lung 
In the
previous version of the diagnosis and treatment guideline for pneumonia caused by
novel coronavirus  the diagnosis was confirmed by the presence of viral nucleic
acids in throat swabs  sputum  and alveolar lavage fluid 
However  the more recent
guideline indicates that if typical chest CT findings are observed in patients
suspected to have COVID  the patient should be clinically diagnosed 
This
reflects the important role of chest CT in the diagnosis 
Moreover  current clinical
experience is showing that the chest CT manifestations change rapidly 
Therefore 
many patients in the present study underwent multiple repeated examinations during
treatment 
To our knowledge  this study is by far the largest case series of
follow up imaging among patients with COVID SARS CoV  infects human respiratory epithelial cells through S protein and has a
strong infection capacity for humans 
Coronavirus particles have a diameter of   to
  nm and can directly reach the bottom of the lung 
Because of lung volume and
gravity  respiratory airflow  and other factors  the type II alveolar epithelial
cells present at the bottom of the lung become the target cells of the coronavirus 
Therefore  the lesions are mainly distributed under the pleura or along the vascular
bronchial bundle  After the alveolar epithelial cells have become combined with the virus  the
alveolar wall is damaged and large numbers of immune cells and lymphocytes
accumulate  resulting in swelling around the lung leaflets and blood vessel
congestion 
The pulmonary lobules merge with each other  forming nodular or patchy
GGOs 
As the disease progresses  multiple lung segments become involved  the scope
of the lesion expands  the alveolar wall shrinks and collapses  and the exfoliated
and necrotic epithelium and the exuded inflammatory cells form a hyaline membrane 
These changes manifest as coexisting imaging abnormalities such as GGOs  nodules 
consolidation  and fibrous cord strips Several studies have focused on the evolution of CT changes in patients with COVID 
pneumonia 
Pan et al  analyzed the disease course according to  day stages and found that the CT
score was the highest on days   to   of the disease course  after   days  the CT
score of the lower lung was significantly higher than that of the middle and upper
lungs 
Zhou et al  found that CT images of patients with COVID  pneumonia showed a
predominantly peripheral  middle  lower  and posterior distribution 
The early rapid
progressive stage was   to   days from symptom onset  the advanced stage with peak
levels of CT abnormalities occurred from   to   days  and the abnormalities started
to improve after   days 
Lei et al  reported that patients with COVID  pneumonia had a typical transition from
the early stage to the advanced stage and then from the advanced stage to the
dissipating stage 
Single or multiple GGOs were distributed along the
bronchovascular or subpleural regions in the pulmonary parenchyma in the early
stage  higher density consolidations were observed in the advanced stage  and the
GGOs and consolidations were absorbed in the dissipating stage 
Xiang et al  evaluated only six patients with COVID  pneumonia and reported that the CT
score peaked at   to   days and that the CT scores of the lower lobes were
significantly higher than those of the middle upper lobes after   days from disease
onset 
These findings were consistent with those reported by Pan et al  Liang et al  reported that the majority of patients had involvement of three or more
lobes 
Bilateral involvement was more prevalent than unilateral involvement 
The
proportions of patients observed to have pure GGOs or GGOs and consolidation
decreased over time  while the proportion of patients with GGOs and linear opacities
increased 
The total severity score showed an increasing trend in the first   weeks 
Bernheim et al  divided the disease course into three stages  –   –  and  –  days  and
found that   of patients in the first stage had normal CT findings 
As the time
since onset of symptoms increased  the CT abnormalities became more frequent  these
findings included consolidation  bilateral and peripheral disease  greater total
lung involvement  linear opacities  the  crazy paving  pattern  and the  reverse
halo  sign In this study  we evaluated the CT findings of   patients with COVID  pneumonia
confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction 
The patients underwent
a mean of        range   –  chest CT examinations 
At present  the course of
COVID  pneumonia and when patients should be re examined remain inconclusive 
As
mentioned above  different studies have staged the disease according to different
time periods 
We grouped the patients  CT scans at different time intervals 
The
time interval grouping was based on current clinical experience and is consistent
with the imaging interval described in the pneumonia diagnosis and treatment guidelines  This grouping is also partially similar to that described by Pan et al  and Zhou et al  Multiple lobe involvement was observed in most patients in all stages  and
lower lobe lesions were significantly more common than upper and middle lobe
lesions  this is also consistent with the findings reported by Pan et al  and Liang et al  As mentioned above  most studies have suggested that patients with COVID 
pneumonia undergo a typical transition from the early stage to the advanced stage
and then from the advanced stage to the dissipating stage  however  the time to
reach the peak of the disease course varies among different studies  and the
patients in our study showed a similar tendency 
GGOs and consolidation were the
common chest CT manifestations  the proportion of GGOs in each stage was similar 
while consolidation and the total CT score first increased and then decreased over
time 
The total CT score was significantly higher in Stage B than in Stage A  while
the total CT score was significantly higher in Stage C than in Stage B 
These
findings suggest that the lung lesions of most patients significantly improved after
  days and that most patients with new coronavirus pneumonia had a disease course
of more than   days This study had three main limitations 
First  we did not consider the effects of
factors such as age  sex  medical history  including hypertension  hyperlipidemia 
hyperglycemia  and malignant tumors  and lifestyle habits  including smoking and
drinking history  on patient outcomes 
Second  although   patients with novel
coronavirus pneumonia were included in this study  the number of patients in Stages
B to E was limited 
Future studies should include more patients and extend the
observation time to ensure that the study results are more representative 
Third 
some studies have suggested that factors such as age  the C reactive protein
concentration  and the interleukin  β concentration may be related to patient
outcomes 
However  we did not perform a correlation analysis between the laboratory
data and patient outcomes In conclusion  we followed up and evaluated   chest CT scans of   patients with
confirmed COVID  pneumonia and found that most patients had a disease course of
more than   days and that the lung lesions of most patients improved significantly
after   days 
The purpose of this study is to help clinicians better understand the
disease course and properly perform chest CT re examinations for patients with
COVID  pneumonia to minimize the radiation dose Transdermal Delivery Systems for BiomoleculesDrug delivery is related to many problems focused on the molecular stability  pharmacokinetic  and amphoteric nature of a substance 
Due to chemical instability and high degradation by enzymatic action regardless of the distance to the specific target organ  all of this is more complicated when the bioactive substance that is intended to be administered is a biomolecule  such as peptides and proteins   Currently  there is a system that is applied to the protein drug delivery  which is a non conventional system developed primarily for protein and peptide drug delivery 
This new delivery system has a higher efficiency that improves the passage of the protein drug to the skin   
The transdermal drug delivery  TDD  system reduces potential exposure to side effects in the host and improves protein stability by also reducing enzymatic degradation  which is very common to occur when a drug takes the most conventional routes to enter the body  such as oral and subcutaneous routes 
Mainly  TDD systems avoid the first pass of metabolism  which occurs in the liver   
The protein and peptide drugs are important in many innovative treatments  such as immunotherapy  where biomolecules  such as antibodies  growth factors  and interleukins  are used 
These are proteins with high susceptibility to degradation to many endogenous and exogenous factors  such as temperature and pH  and most importantly  enzymatic degradation and immune clearance One of the most important advantages of the transdermal route is to maintain drug release in a constant and prolonged release to achieve optimal blood circulation concentrations   
For transdermal protein drug delivery systems  specific methods or devices are used to allow or enhance intact passage through the stratum corneum  SC 
The most suitable systems for the release of biomolecules are the third generation transdermal delivery systems  whose effects are directed to the SC 
For TDD systems of biomolecules and vaccines  thermal ablation and microneedles are the most widely used physical penetration enhancers 
However  there are many other systems that have been tested for transdermal release of biomolecules   that have been included in the second and third generation of transdermal delivery systems  such as iontophoresis and electroporation This article highlights the main technologies used as tools that improve transdermal protein drug delivery systems  addressing them from the point of view of research in the development of transdermal systems where many technologies and devices have a high possibility of use in conventional drug treatments  such as nanotechnology devices 
The authors provide an overview of the various systems that exist in TDD that have been tested and proposed for the transdermal delivery of biomolecules The skin is a three layer laminate that is made up of the SC  the epidermis  and the dermis   
The epidermis is the outermost layer and is formed from the stratified epithelium  the stratum germinativum  spinosum  granulosum  lucidum  and corneum   Fig 
 The SC is the outermost and impermeable skin layer that prevents the entry of most chemicals   
This barrier is formed by around   to   lines of dead keratinocytes  corneocytes  that have united with each other with corneodesmosomes forming a wall embedded in a lipidic matrix 
The extracellular matrix is formed by lipids  such as fatty acids  ceramides  cholesterol  cholesterol sulfate  and sterol wax esters arranged in lamellae  and multiple lipid bilayers  although the matrix is primarily composed of ceramides     
Corneocytes contain involucrin  loricrin  and cornifin around their periphery and have a thickness of   μm  but this can be modified by factors such as hydration and the anatomic site of the skin   
This stratum contains high amounts of keratin inside the corneocytes  and the keratin filaments provide the hexagonal shape and stratum mechanical strength of the corneocyte   
In addition  the SC acts as a barrier  preventing desiccation and pathogen entry and protecting against ultraviolet rays 
The SC also plays an important role in wound repair The transdermal delivery route has been used many times for the local application of therapeutic substances  and it is a practice that is still used and that will continue to grow in the coming years The transdermal drug delivery systems also allow homogeneous absorption and have good pharmaceutical efficiency  reducing the adverse effects that drugs could cause in the host and reduce the drug risk to suffer alterations caused by enzymatic factors and the immune system present in the intrinsic environment 
Besides that  these systems are more comfortable for the patient   This method is formed by steps that start when the therapeutic molecule enters the skin until it enters the blood circulation 
The first step is penetration  which occurs when the drug is deposited onto the specific skin layer 
Later  the permeation step occurs when the molecule diffuses from one layer to another 
Finally  in the resorption process  the drug enters the bloodstream     This type of drug delivery system has advantages over traditional systems because it can allow the storage of small amounts of drugs in the transport and delivery structure  which are developed by nanotechnology using mainly polymeric nanomaterials made with biopolymers  microneedles  and nanoparticles With these devices  it is possible to improve drug delivery and its bioavailability 
Thus  it is possible to reduce the frequency between drug administrations 
The most innovative property is that the device is only replaced when the dose is finished and it can take several days     
The exact side effects that they could trigger are unknown  since they could mainly depend on the type of bioactive drug it contains  which could be related to some effects of the mechanical properties of the skin    Table  Peptides and proteins have long been important resources in the treatment of many diseases 
Many of the therapies that are applied for many diseases have recently used peptides and proteins  which is called biological therapy and focuses on the production of the main proteins obtained from living organisms such as transforming bacteria The main diseases which are treated with proteins are diabetes  hemophilia  infectious diseases  and anemia 
These therapeutic proteins are primarily hormones  interleukins  anticoagulants  and enzymes  which are recombinant proteins 
Other protein drugs  such as calcitonin  rituximab  gemtuzumab  insulin  epidermal growth factor  and interferons  are best known for their importance in the treatment of osteoporosis  lymphoma  leukemia  and diabetes mellitus   The most employed biological protein therapy is immunotherapy  which has several applications 
One of the most important applications is cancer treatment  which is a specific treatment that employs cytokines  a kind of protein produced by the immunity system that helps the patient s immune system eliminate cancer cells and prevents the replication of cancer cells 
These immune proteins are classified in therapeutic groups known as cytokines  monoclonal antibodies  tyrosine kinase inhibitor  and rapamycin receptor inhibitors in mammals  mTOR    
Two main kinds of cytokines are the most importantly used in biological therapies  interleukins and interferons 
Production is carried out with laboratory animals and once extracted and purified  they are used by injection into a human recipient for clinical treatment  e g  monoclonal antibodies 
However  there are many applications for products  such as antibodies obtained from live organisms and these are used mainly for the prevention of diseases such as in the development of vaccines 
The most important pharmaceutical products are listed in Table     Each one of these peptides or proteins has a different method of administration  such as intravenous  oral  topical  or intravesical 
Some other proposed methods of administration that would avoid the difficulties of the route of administration and offer comfort to the user include the nasal  pulmonary  ocular  and rectal routes    which could be as invasive as the traditional routes in many cases 
The main drawback of this type of therapies is that traditional administration such as subcutaneous injection and intravenous administration can modify their effectiveness  since the route of administration may vary in different clinical circumstances  for example  it may contribute to an increase in blood pressure   When any substance  including proteins  enters the bloodstream regardless of the route of administration  these proteins are exposed to many environmental threats such as sequestration by the reticuloendothelial system mainly for macrophage internalization  enzymatic degradation and absorption and elimination of serum proteins by the liver  –   which is an important factor to consider  since it represents a low efficiency in the application of biological therapy due to its high rate of degradation and elimination   
In addition to protecting the lability of all therapeutic proteins  it is also about preventing them from exerting their activity in places that do not require it 
Although immunotherapy is more effective and less toxic than therapies made with chemical molecules  these immune proteins also trigger adverse effects in the host  such as autoimmunities and non specific inflammatory processes   
For these reasons  research is being carried out on the use of alternative technologies with which these side effects can be controlled  such as with the use of nanotechnology using polymers  with which these proteins can be protected  favoring their transport and direct delivery to their objective  preventing them from exerting their toxic effect on non specific cells and sites   Nanocarriers  such as nanotubes    microneedles  MNs   –   fusion peptide carriers    or peptide conjugated nanoparticles  NPs      are some of the main carriers and protective systems used in immunotherapy  regardless of the size or structure of the molecule to be transported and protected  which could be genetic material  interferon  interleukins  or antibodies In   the US FDA approved the use of TDD systems and their use has been increasing in relevance for protein drugs because for some molecules these delivery systems improve the solubility of the compound  in addition to allowing it to pass efficiently through the skin There are important findings in research revealing that TDD technologies allow the loading  transport  and release of protein drugs 
They are very promising for the effective treatment of local cancers  with skin location  and they have a second benefit of activating the immune system from a remote distance 
Some of them have been developed to carry ribonucleic acid  RNA  that can regulate localized gene expression within a known target 
In other cases  it is possible to use an immunologic protein that could produce a strong adaptive immune response against a specific antigen in the case of vaccines  where it could be made with the tumor antigen expressed in the gene  tumor related protein or peptide  specific epitope  or cell lysate   For immunotherapy  it might be possible to employ monoclonal antibody loaded TDD systems and tumor agnostic therapies  non specific immunotherapies  use of interferons and interleukins  and cancer theranostic treatment where SC could be interrupted by a nanogel delivering a drug through the skin and allowing it to accumulate at the tumor site   or these systems may even function by delivering vaccine antigens  cancer vaccines  using nanoparticles and liposomes as antigenic carriers loaded on nanogels to pass the antigen through the SC by iontophoresis   
It is also possible to use microneedles loaded with Dermatophagoides farinae extract to achieve effective allergen release and effective immune response induction   These strategies have a wide range of application in various skin pathological circumstances  in addition to their main role in cancer therapy  and many products are used for the treatment of cancer 
Some of the commercial pharmaceutical products used for cancer therapy  which are administered transdermally  are described in Table     Through the use of transdermal delivery systems  it is sought to increase the solubility and stability  the circulating life  and the pharmacokinetic properties of drug proteins and peptides 
It is recommended to consider that the TDD system is not applicable to many of the biomolecules that are used as medical treatments since the success in the transdermal passage could depend on certain factors 
The efficacy of this therapeutic system depends both on the physical and chemical properties of the proteins and on the percutaneous administration systems of biomolecules to be used 
Regarding protein  the main physical properties to consider are the shape and size  molecular weight  solubility  and amphoteric nature  the latter being perhaps one of the most important to consider since due to its amphoteric property it can migrate in an electric field and its migration direction depends on the net charge that it has 
The knowledge of this property could help to elucidate which are the best percutaneous administration systems to facilitate passage through the SC 
In the case of charged proteins  physical  electrical  enhancers are the best option to use 
The chemical nature of proteins is another especially important factor to know 
This composition could help us to choose the best TDD system through which the protein will pass through the SC avoiding the reactivity of some functional groups of proteins 
For these reasons  there is little increase in the development of new therapeutic formulations administered by TDD systems  since there are some protein properties that need to be studied and analyzed to know if they can be administered by this route without affecting its stability and pharmacokinetic properties Peptides are molecules that have a molecular weight between   Da and   kDa 
This molecular weight depends on the molecular structures and their lengths with a small amount of amino acids or constitutes a protein with a complex structure 
These molecules are charged in a physiological pH and are hydrophilic  which complicates their permeability across the skin 
Some drugs have a lower or higher affinity with the lipophilic condition of the SC  which determines the quantity of the molecule that can cross this layer of the skin naturally 
Therefore  it is better to use a technique that improves passage to the skin  using or not natural permeation molecular routes avoiding the degradation of peptides or proteins and ensuring passage and integrity during the transport and release processes   There are important skin conditions that can change permeability  such as age  heat  racial differences  freezing  abrasion  chemical irritant activity  and some diseases such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis 
It is very important to recognize these for the development and use of devices employed in transdermal protein drug delivery In the skin  three molecular permeation routes are the most important  intracellular  intercellular  and follicular routes 
All of these are beneficiated by the concentration gradient of the molecules present in the milieu  allowing passive diffusion across the SC   
Moreover  physicochemical properties from the molecule affect its passage through the SC 
Hydrophobic molecules can cross the SC intercellularly  whereas hydrophilic molecules cross intracellularly by corneocytes 
Passage through the skin can take place through so called cutaneous defects  in which the skin has a discontinuity  such as sweat glands or hair shafts   In the skin  the SC and lipid layers have a barrier function  as both prevent the loss of water and avoid the entry of any substances  molecules  or microorganisms from the environment or microbiome 
These layers play a crucial role in the passive passage of proteins and other chemicals into the skin 
The liquid flux between the lipid layer depends on the lamellar and linear lipid matrix arrangement 
The lamellar layer is generally oriented parallel to the SC  and linear lipids are perpendicular to the SC 
If no long periodicity phase  LPP  exists  the permeability increases   
However  if the orthorhombic phase  OP  predominates  the permeability of the lipids is reduced  and if the OP predominates in the lateral layer  the permeation decreases   
The LPP is primarily formed by ceramides  cholesterol  and free fatty acids  and these have a unique tri layer organization  while an all trans chain lipid organization exists in the OP phase  which has a rectangular crystalline lattice and no mobility Transdermal drug delivery has been used for many years  and the skin was thought to be impervious to exogenous chemical molecules 
Currently  it is known that the skin is a semi permeable barrier  which allows its use as a transport route for molecules  allowing the molecule to reach the therapeutic target intact 
However  due to its anatomy  hydrophilic molecules can only pass through the skin if they are small  and even then  in many cases  they require help from an electric field  electrotherapies  as in the case of electroporation   and iontophoresis   
These techniques use a low voltage supplementation  direct current  around the drug site  allowing and enhancing passage through the skin   
When an electric field is applied to the skin  a large molecular movement occurs and the molecule can take the path of the hair follicle through the skin or induce pore formation     There is another technology using acoustic transmission  sonophoresis  that is used in medical trials  such as hyperthermia treatment  physical therapy  and ultrasonic surgery  which has the ability to facilitate drug transport to the skin   
Through this technique  mechanical waves of medium or low frequency are transferred to a physical medium  such as a specific gel  which allows it to propagate and transmit energy 
In the ultrasonic system  wave sounds have an oscillation frequency greater than   kHz   The TDD systems are an alternative route that allows the control of the drug release and decreases the possibility of any side effects associated with levels that are higher than the minimum pharmacological concentration  reducing pharmacological dosing times because a patch is administered every   to   h  This eliminates the risk of metabolism of the therapeutic agent and the loss of the available dose 
In addition  there are other advantages  such as the noninvasive drug delivery method  which can be discontinued at any time   
To facilitate TDD to improve SC permeation  some technologies improve drug flux of difficult drugs    such as cryioneumatic and photpneumatic technologies  sonphoresis  iontophoresis  electroporation  jet injection  and MN  which are used in the delivery of many drugs   The disadvantage in the above cases is that all devices require a low voltage supplement 
In addition  it is necessary to purchase equipment to manage the electrical current 
In addition  in some people it can cause sensitivity  such as tingling and irritation  and the technique can even cause blistering of the skin 
In these cases  when the technique is not well applied  it can cause burns to the skin 
In all circumstances  these techniques must be applied by trained personnel Despite these drawbacks  considerable research has been focused on the transport of peptides through the skin with good results 
In Table   we list some examples of these studies  the biomolecules and penetration enhancers  and the main result of each 
The table also indicates whether the physical penetration enhancer acts alone or is enhanced by a combination with another enhancer or nanocarrier    –  Many compounds have been employed to improve the penetration of substances across the skin  such as azone  pyrrolidones  alkanols  sulfoxides  glycols  alcohols  and surfactants   
Each of the chemical penetration enhancers has a specific action mechanism in the skin penetration process Due to the characteristics of the upper layer of the skin  which is specialized in avoiding and preventing the entry of any molecule or pathogen  the SC is complicated in terms of the passage of molecules greater than   Da  but it is not impossible 
In many cases  this process can be carried out using penetration enhancer molecules  which have good results in terms of penetration of molecules through the skin 
However  it represents a disadvantage because it could permit not only pathogens but also microorganisms in the cutaneous microbiota to enter as a consequence of cellular disruption integrity and the focal detachment of superficial corneocytes  such as in the use of thioglycolate in depilatory treatments   
The process of percutaneous absorption of a therapeutic molecule consists of several processes  which include the dissolution and release of the therapeutic agent  partition and diffusion within the SC  partition from the SC to the aqueous phase of the epidermis and its diffusion  and finally  access to the systemic circulation and target tissue There are three routes through which any molecule can breach this and reach the microcirculation through the tissue 
These are the intercellular  transcellular  and transappendageal routes  but the route can depend on the drug s molecular weight  Fig 
    Chemical penetration enhancers are a good alternative to allow the passage of biomolecules  but most of them cause skin irritation  which is uncomfortable for patients   
In many cases  the penetration enhancers have synergic activity when they are used in combination    but they can generate more skin irritation problems 
The mode of action of these enhancers is different for each one and depends on the mechanism by which it interacts with the compounds of the SC 
Due to this capacity  it has been classified according to their interaction ability in those that  a  interact with lipid heads within aqueous domains of the lipid bilayers and interact with the lipid alkyl chain   b  interact with actin filaments in the corneocytes   c  allow partitioning augmentation and increase drug protein solubility in the SC  and  d  improve penetration indirectly  modifying the drug  Fig 
    
Some of the most studied chemical penetration enhancers are the terpenes  amide  fatty acids  monoglycerides  and surfactants  and some of the most commonly studied are  D limonene  azone  lauric acid  monoolein and sodium lauryl sulfate   Depending on their chemical structure  some polymers can transport drug molecules within their structure  as in the case of cyclodextrins and their derivatives together with other saccharides  moieties  that can transport drugs as ketoprofen   or biomolecules such as levothyroxine sodium  T  which has been used as a topical treatment to eliminate lipid deposits in subcutaneous adipose tissue 
The main problem with this type of application has been the IT  detection in rabbits   h after the application of the cream 
The use of dimethyl cyclodextrin as a solubilizer for levothyroxine increased its solubility  but unfortunately  it only succeeded in penetrating much less levothyroxine through the skin than the required dose in humans   
In this way  it is important to highlight that the complex improves the solubility of the molecule allowing it to pass through the SC  and in another specific treatment  it could recognize a specific target in the cell plasma membrane and then adhere to it and release its content in a more efficient way Proteins are a substantial problem when we try to pass them through the skin 
First  they are larger  and second  they are highly susceptible to enzymatic degradation 
Not all are thermostable  and finally  another difficulty is that proteins and peptides live for a short time in plasma 
For this  it is necessary to protect them during their trip to the place of action 
Furthermore  this protection enables controlled delivery 
Passing through the skin can be less difficult if the protein is in a capsule  which is best when the capsule size is in the nanometric range Advances in the science of polymers applied in pharmacy have allowed the development of many encapsulation techniques that range from the most impractical to the most revolutionary methods 
However  this reveals a problem  as some polymers are not soluble in water and require organic solvents 
Furthermore  the integrity of the protein to be encapsulated is compromised regardless of the encapsulation technique Many types of polymers could be used in drug delivery  however  their chemical structure and molecular weight do not allow dissolution in water in many cases  and most dissolve well in organic solvents 
The solubility of the polymer is a characteristic that is important to determine before use because it can determine the environmental resistance in the process in which it will be used Biopolymers and their combinations are best used for these procedures  helping to improve the stability of the formulation as in the case of encapsulating transforming growth factor  TGF β  in poly d l lactic co glycolic acid   PLGA  and polyethylene glycol  PEG  polymeric microparticles for bone regeneration   
Insulin loaded PCL PEG PCL NPs are another example where the NPs were prepared by the w o w double emulsion solvent evaporation method and demonstrated satisfactory insulin delivery and efficacy in treating diabetic rats   
These NPs possess a specific protein drug delivery with a delivery degradation speed 
They are hydrophobic or hydrophilic according to what is necessary for the encapsulation procedure and for improvement in the stability of the protein drug 
They have a low or no chance of rejection and are safe to use Encapsulation processes are classified into two types  chemical and mechanical  which are then classified according to the methodology used to make the capsule 
This can be determined according to the desired size  shape  and composition surface chemistry 
The encapsulation of biomolecules by these methods allows us to avoid the degradation of the free protein and allows the prolonged and constant release of a protein drug in constant time     With these methods  it is possible to obtain nano sized particles  which are especially important to avoid their elimination by the immune system and the liver   
Smaller and softer particles can better evade the immune system  and this can be compatible with the recipient organism 
It is important to note that capsules with a diameter size of ≤  μm have the risk of being engulfed by phagocytic immune cells  therefore  the recommended NP size that could have an appropriate delivery range is   to   nm   Dendrimers are three dimensional NPs  like macromolecules  and are considered based on nanometric size 
These are radially symmetric and comprise an inner core structure made up of a central atom covalently bonded between other atoms 
The external composition is highly branched  forming a dendrimer structure 
These branches allow the formation of cavities into which bioactive molecules   can be incorporated  such as proteins   and peptides used for many pathological treatments   and for storage  transport  and controlled delivery There are many types of dendrimer structures  and depending on the synthesis method  these methods could use click chemistry   and divergent and convergent strategies 
In addition  there are different designs and chemical elements 
Their application in the administration of drugs has focused on the fact that these have many biocompatible characteristics 
These characteristics include non immunogenicity  non toxicity  and a high ability to cross biological barriers  such as cell membranes  blood vessels  intestines  and the blood brain barrier   In addition  they have high stability in blood circulation and a prolonged blood circulation half life  and they target specific structures 
These NPs can be manufactured in high purity and have some degree of in vitro toxicity when manufactured with cationic and anionic surface groups 
However  it is possible to reduce this toxicity by using surface protection by PEGs or fatty acids   In TDD systems  dendrimers have been employed for the penetration of nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs  such as indomethacin  which is an arthritis and osteoarthritis auxiliary drug in the treatment of the pain generated from this disease 
There is a study that reports the progress of the TAT PAMAM dendrimer system developed as a non viral vector for the transdermal release of DNA plasmids where the dendrimer system was modified 
The HIV transcriptional transactivator  TAT  was conjugated as a cell penetrating peptide to enhance the uptake of constructed plasmid DNA pIRES H GFP by cells   
Dendrimers are an excellent drug penetration enhancer   and they are some of the best nanostructures that have high applicability in medicine for the delivery of peptides and proteins As mentioned  traditional routes  intradermal  gastric  or intravenous  have long been the main delivery route for all drugs 
Nevertheless  the appearance of an increase in chronic diseases has allowed the development of new technologies that are less invasive and have high efficiency upon reaching the target  especially in cases in which a user must take more than one medicine for the treatment of one or more diseases at a time Although the design and use of MNs can ensure the entrance of molecules across the skin  biomolecules have a high degradation risk that can occur at any time  in the charging process or at the moment of release 
Thus  it is better to protect the protein contained within a specialized structure  such as nanocapsules or dendrimers  NPs in both cases 
This procedure has no danger for the protein or peptide structural composition  which improves the conservation and passage of these compositions across the SC  Fig 
 The PLGA NPs can go through SC better with the help of MNs because the micro conduits created by these needles allow the NPs to avoid the SC barrier and arrive at other skin layers and deliver the complete contents  Fig 
    
For this procedure  it is necessary to consider that  in all cases  the penetration capacity of NPs depends on the particle and channel size   
Despite this important consideration  among others  the procedure also avoids the limitations of the skin s physicochemical properties that do not permit crossing it Some experimental studies have demonstrated the penetration and distribution of PLGA NPs in MNs   
The most common use of NPs MNs is for experimental insulin release systems using murine models in rats with induced diabetes  where the insulin is introduced into H O responsive mesoporous silica NPs  and MN patches are manufactured for later transdermal application 
Its release behavior analysis demonstrated effective release   
For immunity induction  an excellent response occurs when the NPs MNs were employed 
For example  for the induction of immunity against endogenous prostate cancer stem cell antigen RALA pPSCA  the immunization via the NP MN release system resulted in anti tumor activity in both cases of prophylactic and treatment assays in vivo   
Another experimental process that allows probing the system efficacy is the use of poly methylmethacrylate  coated with   nm of gold NPs  which has great potential in tumoral cell destruction   Currently  there are few authorized devices  however  these are increasing because for many treatments  such devices are more appropriately used  effective  and exhibit more recommended results 
Perhaps shortly  these devices will be the most appropriate techniques for drug and protein delivery systems For many decades  a great number of therapies to resolve the problems associated with drug release have been implicated to probe numerous kinds of devices and pharmaceutical innovations to solve many diseases or applications in various clinical trials for the diagnosis of diseases or treatments of diseases 
For this application  it is necessary to design new technologies  and pharmaceutical chemistry has been concerned with offering the best administration methods for therapeutic agents Lately  many research studies have reported numerous results that indicate the most appropriate technologies to use in each case of a drug delivery system 
Each of the aforementioned TDD systems has some advantages and disadvantages for use in administering protein drug delivery However  these technologies create substantial and important opportunities for administering biomolecules 
In the coming years  we will observe an increase in their design  development  characterization  and clinical trials for the treatment of many important and chronic diseases SARS CoV  recruits a haem metabolite to evade antibody immunityDNA fragments encoding SARS CoV  S   Uniprot ID  P DTC  residues  –  NTD  –  RBD  –  SARS CoV  S   Uniprot ID  P  residues  –  HCoV NL   Uniprot ID  Q Q S  residues  –  HCoV OC   isolate LRTI  NCBI accession code KX  residues  –  were codon optimised for expression in human cells and cloned into pQ C xStrep vector   under control of the cytomegalovirus  CMV  promoter for production of the recombinant proteins carrying a C terminal extension containing human rhinovirus    C protease recognition site followed by a TwinStrep tag

Measurements were performed in duplicate Recombination Every Day  Abundant Recombination in a Virus during a Single Multi Cellular Host InfectionAs increasing numbers of full length viral sequences become available  recombinant or mosaic viruses are being recognized more frequently   
Recombination events have been demonstrated to be associated with viruses expanding their host range   or increasing their virulence    thus accompanying  or perhaps even being at the origin of  major changes during virus adaptation 
It remains unclear  however  whether recombination events represent a highly frequent and significant phenomenon in the everyday life of these viruses Viruses can exchange genetic material when at least two different viral genomes co infect the same host cell 
Progeny can then become hybrid through different mechanisms  such as reassortment of segments when the parental genomes are fragmented    intra molecular recombination when polymerases switch templates  in RNA viruses     or homologous or non homologous recombination  in both RNA and DNA viruses 
Quantification of viral recombination in multi cellular organisms has been attempted under two distinct experimental approaches  in vitro  in cell cultures     and in vivo  in live hosts    
The in vitro approach  which has so far been applied only to animal viruses  allows the establishment of the  intrinsic  recombination rate in experimentally co infected cells in cell cultures   
However  it does not necessarily reflect the situation in entire  living hosts  where the frequency of co infected cells is poorly known and depends on many factors such as the size of the pathogen population  the relative frequency and distribution of the different variants  and host defense mechanisms preventing secondary infection of cells 
The in vivo experimental approach is closer to biological conditions and may thus be more informative of what actually happens in  the real world However  as discussed below  numerous experimental constraints have so far precluded an actual quantification of the baseline rate of recombination 
First  many experimental designs have used extreme positive selection  where only recombinant genomes were viable  e g    
Other studies did not use complementation techniques but detected recombinants by PCR within infected hosts or tissues    which provides information on their presence but not on their frequency in the viral population 
So far  no quantitative PCR or other quantitative method has been applied to evaluate the number of recombinants appearing in an experimentally infected live host 
Finally  recent methods based on sequence analysis inferred the population recombination rate  rather than the individual recombination rate   
While results from these methods certainly take in vivo recombination into account  there are other caveats  isolates have often been collected in different hosts sometimes in different geographical regions and sometimes the selective neutrality of sequence variation on which these estimates are based is not clearly established 
Estimates from such studies by essence address the estimation of the recombination rate at a different evolutionary scale Taken together  the currently available information indicates that no viral recombination rate has ever been estimated directly at time and space scales corresponding to a single multi cellular host infection  although this level is most significant for the biology and evolution of viruses 
This study intends to fill this gap by evaluating the recombination frequency of the cauliflower mosaic virus  CaMV  during a single passage in one of its host plants  the turnip Brassica rapa CaMV is a pararetrovirus  which is a major grouping containing hepadnaviruses  e g  hepatitis B virus  badnaviruses  e g  banana streak virus  and caulimoviruses  e g  CaMV 
Pararetroviruses are characterized by a non segmented double stranded DNA genome 
After entering the host cell nucleus  the viral DNA accumulates as a minichromosome   whose transcription is ensured by the host RNA polymerase II   
The CaMV genome consists in approximately   bp and encodes six viral gene products that have been detected in planta  Figure     
Viral proteins P  to P  are expressed from two major transcripts  namely a  S RNA  encoding P  and a  S RNA corresponding to the entire genome and serving as mRNA for proteins P –P    
Using the pre genomic  S RNA as a matrix  the protein P   product of gene V  reverse transcribes the genome into genomic DNA that is concomitantly encapsidated   The detection of CaMV recombinants in turnip hosts has been reported numerous times 
Some studies have demonstrated the appearance of infectious recombinant viral genomes after inoculation  i  of a host plant with two infectious or non infectious parental clones   or  ii  of a transgenic plant containing one CaMV transgene with a CaMV genome missing the corresponding genomic region   
While the former revealed inter genomic viral recombination  the latter demonstrated that CaMV can also recombine with transgenes within the host s genome 
Another study based on phylogenetic analyses of various CaMV strains has clearly suggested different origins for different genomic regions and  hence  multiple recombination events during the evolution of this virus   
Indirect experimental evidence has indicated that  in some cases  CaMV recombination could occur within the host nucleus  between different viral minichromosomes  presumably through the action of the DNA repair cellular machinery   
Nevertheless  the mechanism of  template switching  during reverse transcription  predominant in all retroviruses  most certainly also applies to pararetroviruses 
For this reason  and on the basis of numerous experimental data  CaMV is generally believed to recombine mostly in the cytoplasm of the host cell  by  legal  template switching between two pre genomic RNA molecules    or  illegal  template switching between the  S and the  S RNA   
Under this hypothesis  recombination in CaMV could therefore be considered as operating on a linear template during reverse transcription  with the  ′ and  ′ extremities later ligated to circularize the genomic DNA  position   in Figure  
The above cited studies clearly demonstrate that CaMV is able to recombine 
However  since these studies are based on complementation techniques  non quantitative detection  or phylogenetically based inferences of recombination  they do not inform us on whether recombination is an exceptional event or an  everyday  process shaping the genetic composition of CaMV populations In the present work  we aimed at answering this question 
To this end  we have constructed a CaMV genome with four genetic markers  demonstrated to be neutral in competition experiments 
By co inoculating host plants with equal amounts of wild type and marker containing CaMV particles  we have generated mixed populations in which impressive proportions of recombinants distributed in several different classes corresponding to exchange of different genomic regions have been detected and quantified 
Altogether  the recombinant genomes averaged over   of the population 
Further analysis of these data  assuming a number of viral replications during the infection period ranging from five to   indicates that the per nucleotide per replication cycle recombination rate of CaMV is of the same order of magnitude  i e  on the order of a few   across the entire genome 
We thereby provide the first quantification  to our knowledge  of the recombination rate in a virus population during a single passage in a single host From Figure   and supposing that all marker containing genomic regions can recombine  we could predict the detection and quantification of seven classes of recombinant genotypes   bcd a  a cd b  ab d c  abc d   cd ab  a d bc  and a c b d 
Indeed  all classes were detected  and their frequencies in the ten CaMV populations analyzed are summarized in Table  Altogether  the proportion of recombinant genomes found in the mixed viral populations was astonishingly high and very similar in the ten co infected plants analyzed  Table   last column  ranging between    plant   to    plants     and   with a mean frequency   standard error  of      
This result indicates that recombination events are very frequent during the invasion of the host plant by CaMV and represents  to our knowledge  the first direct quantification of viral recombination during the infection of a live multi cellular host The inferred per generation recombination and interference rates  assuming that CaMV undergoes ten replication cycles during the   d between infection and sampling  are given for each of the ten plants in Table  
Recombination rates between adjacent markers are large  on the order of   to  
Taking the distance in nucleotides between markers into account yields an average recombination rate per nucleotide and generation on the order of      
Interestingly  this recombination rate does not vary throughout the genome  Kruskal–Wallis test  p    To relax the assumption of the number of replications during the   d  we calculated the recombination parameters assuming five or   generations 
The effect of the number of generations on the estimates is linear  doubling the number of generations results in a halving of the recombination rate  detailed results not shown 
For example  the average recombination rates r
  r
  and r
  assuming   generations were equal to     and   respectively  compare with values in Table   yielding per nucleotide per generation recombination rates of             and      Inspection of Table   also shows that first order interference coefficients were in general negative  indicating that a crossing over in one genomic segment increases the probability that a crossing over will occur in another genomic segment  while the second order coefficient parameter had an average value close to zero with a large variance 
The mechanism leading to these results will be discussed in the following section One major breakthrough in the work presented here lies in the space and time scales at which the experiments were performed 
Indeed  the processes occurring within the course of a single infection of one multi cellular host are of obvious biological relevance for any disease 
Previous studies on viral recombination suffered from major drawbacks in this respect  basing their conclusions on experiments relying on complementation among non infectious viruses or between viruses with undetermined relative fitness  on phylogenetically based analyses  or on experiments in cell cultures 
For reasons detailed in the Introduction  the first two methods either do not provide information on the frequency of recombination  but only its occurrence  or address the question at a different temporal  and often spatial  scale 
Results from cell cultures  on the other hand  impose cell co infection by different viral variants  potentially overestimating the frequency of recombination events 
Our study circumvents these limitations by analyzing viral genotypes sampled from infected plants after the course of a single infection  and therefore the invasion and co infection of cells in various organs and tissues is very close to natural More than half of the genomes       see Table   present in a CaMV population after a single passage in its host plant were identified as recombinants  and these data allowed us to infer a per nucleotide per generation recombination rate on the order of       to      
The time length of one generation  i e  the time required for a given genome to go from one replication to the next  is totally unknown in plant viruses 
The only experimental data available on CaMV are based on the kinetics of gene expression in infected protoplasts  where the capsid protein is produced between   and   h   
The reverse transcription and the encapsidation of genomic DNA being two coupled phenomena    we judged it reasonable to assume a generation time of   d and  thus  an average of ten generations during our experiments 
In case this estimate is mistaken  we have verified a linear relationship between r and the number of generations  thereby allowing an immediate adjustment of r if the CaMV generation time is more precisely established 
At this point  we must consider that all cloned genomes may not have been through all the successive replication events potentially allowed by the timing of our experiments 
It was previously shown that about   of CaMV mature virus particles accumulate in compact inclusion bodies    where they may be sequestered for a long time  as such inclusions are very frequent in all infected cells  including those in leaves that have been invaded by the virus population for several weeks 
The viral population may thus present an age structure that could bias the estimation of the recombination rate 
In order to minimize this bias  the clones we analyzed were collected in one young newly formed leaf  where the chances of finding genomes from  unsequestered lines  were assumed to be higher 
In any case  our data analysis is conservative  since this age structure can only lead to an underestimation of the recombination rate Our results show that interferences between pairs of loci are negative  a recombination event between two loci apparently increases the probability of recombination between another pair of loci 
We believe that the most parsimonious explanation of these negative interferences is based on the way the infection builds up within plant hosts 
Indeed  one can divide infected host cells into those infected by a single virus genotype and those infected by more than one viral genotype 
In the former  analogous to clonal propagation  recombination is undetectable 
In the latter  recombination is not only detectable but  as our results indicate  very frequent 
Samples consisting of viruses resulting from a mixture of these two types of host cell infections will thus contain viruses with no recombination and viruses with several recombination events  thus yielding an impression of negative interference 
These conceptual arguments are supported by mathematical models 
It is indeed easy to show  detailed results not shown  that if a proportion F of the population reproduces clonally  analogous to single infections  while the remaining reproduces panmictically  negative interferences could be inferred even if they do not exist 
For example  assuming a three locus model with real recombination rates r
  and r
  and interference i
  the  apparent  recombination and interference parameters  would be r
        F r  r
        F r
  and i
     F   i
    F 
Interestingly  this example also shows that our estimates of the recombination rate are conservative  that a fraction F of host cells are singly infected while others are multiply infected leads to an underestimation of the recombination rate As judged by r
  r
  and r
  calculated between markers a–b  b–c  and c–d  respectively  we found evidence for recombination through the entire CaMV genome 
The values for r
 
r
  and r
  are remarkably similar  hence the recombination sites seem to be evenly distributed along the genome 
We considered the template switching model as the major way recombinants are created in CaMV 
As already mentioned in the Introduction  hot spots of template switching have been predicted at the position of the  ′ extremities of the  S and  S RNAs   
If other recombination mechanisms  such as that associated with second strand DNA synthesis or with the host cell DNA repair machinery  act significantly  hot spots would be expected at the positions of the sequence interruption     and     
Due to the design of our experiment and the position of the four markers  we have no information on putative hot spots at positions corresponding to the  ′ end of the  S RNA and to    at nucleotide position  
Nevertheless  the putative hot spots at the  ′ end of the  S RNA and at   and    nucleotide positions   and   respectively  fall between marker pairs c–d  b–c  and a–b  respectively 
Our results indicate that either these hot spots are quantitatively equivalent though predicted by different recombination mechanisms or  more likely  that they simply do not exist 
Whatever the explanation  what we observe is that the CaMV can exchange any portion of its genome  and thus any gene thereof  with an astonishingly high frequency during the course of a single host infection To our knowledge  the viral recombination rate has never previously been quantified experimentally for a plant virus   
In contrast  retroviruses and particularly HIV  have been extensively investigated in that sense 
As we have already discussed for these latter cases  the quantification of the intrinsic recombination rate was carried out in artificially co infected cell cultures 
The estimated intrinsic per nucleotide per generation recombination rate in HIV  is on the order of      less than one order of magnitude higher than our estimation for CaMV 
Because for various reasons detailed above we probably underestimate the within host CaMV recombination rate  we believe that the intrinsic recombination rate in CaMV is higher and perhaps on the order of that of HIV Other pararetroviruses such as plant badnaviruses or vertebrate hepadnaviruses have a similar cycle within their host cells  including steps of nuclear minichromosome  genomic size RNA synthesis  and reverse transcription and encapsidation 
Nevertheless  vertebrate hepadnaviruses  e g  hepatitis B virus  infect hosts that are very different from plants in their biology and physiology  and this could lead to a totally different frequency of cell co infection during the development of the virus populations 
Thus  even though our results can be informative for other pararetroviruses because of the viruses  shared biological characteristics  they should not be extrapolated to vertebrate pararetroviruses without caution We used the plasmid pCa  which is the complete genome of the CaMV isolate Cabb S  cloned into the pBR  plasmid at the unique SalI restriction site   
To analyze recombination in different regions of the genome  we introduced four genetic markers  a  b  c  and d  at the positions       and   respectively  thus approximately at four cardinal points of the CaMV circular double stranded DNA of   bp  Figure  
All markers  each corresponding to a single nucleotide change  were introduced by PCR directed mutagenesis in pCa  and resulted in the duplication of previously unique restriction sites BsiWI  PstI  MluI  and SacI in a plasmid designated pMark S  Because  in this study  we targeted the possible exchange of genes between viral genomes  all markers a  b  c  and d were introduced within coding regions corresponding to open reading frames I  IV  V  and VI  respectively 
Another important concern was to quantify recombination in the absence of selection  i e  to create neutral markers 
Consequently all markers consist of synonymous mutations  see below To generate the parental virus particles  plasmids pCa  and pMark S were mechanically inoculated into individual plants as previously described   
All plants were turnips  B  rapa cv   Just Right  grown under glasshouse conditions at   °C with a    light dark  photoperiod 
Thirty days post inoculation  all symptomatic leaves were harvested and viral particles were purified as described earlier   The resulting preparations of parental viruses  designated Cabb S and Mark S  were quantified by spectrometry using the formula described by Hull et al 
  
We fixed the initial frequency of markers to a value of   and a solution containing   mg ml of virus particles of both Cabb S and Mark S at a   ratio was prepared 
Plantlets were co infected by mechanical inoculation of two to three leaves with   μl of this virus solution  using abrasive Celite AFA  Fluka  Ronkonkoma  New York  United States 
The mixed CaMV population was allowed to grow during   d of systemic infection We designed an experimental protocol for quantifying marker frequency within a mixed Cabb S Mark S virus population after a single passage in a host plant 
Twenty four individual plants  inoculated as above with equal amounts of Cabb S and Mark S  were harvested   d post inoculation  when symptoms were fully developed 
The viral DNA was purified from   mg of young newly formed infected leaves according to the protocol described previously   
After the precipitation step of this protocol  the viral DNA was resuspended and further purified with the Wizard DNA clean up kit  Promega  Fitchburg  Wisconsin  United States  in TE  X   mM Tris HCl and   mM EDTA  pH   
Aliquots of viral DNA preparations were digested by restriction enzymes corresponding either to marker a  b  c  or d and submitted to a   agarose gel electrophoresis  colored by ethydium bromide and exposed to UV 
Each individual restriction enzyme cut once in Cabb S DNA and twice in Mark S  thus generating DNA fragments of different sizes attributable to one or the other in the mixed population of CaMV genomes 
After scanning the agarose gels  we estimated the relative frequency of the two genotypes in each viral DNA preparation and at each marker position  by densitometry using the NIH   Image program 
The statistical analyses of the frequency of the four markers are described below To identify and quantify the recombinants within the CaMV mixed populations  aliquots from ten of the   viral DNA preparations described above were digested by the restriction enzyme SalI  and directly cloned into pUC  at the corresponding site 
In each of the ten viral populations analyzed    full genome length clones were digested separately by BsiWI  PstI  MluI  and SacI  to test for the presence of marker a  b  c  and d  respectively 
In this experiment  with the marker representing an additional restriction site  we could easily distinguish between the Cabb S and the Mark S genotype at all four marker positions  upon agarose gel   electrophoresis of the digested clones 
Clones with none or all four markers were parental genotypes  whereas clones harboring     or   markers were clearly recombinants 
Due to the very high number of recombinants detected  markers eventually appearing or disappearing due to spontaneous mutations were neglected Here we present the different methods we used to quantify recombination in the CaMV genome 
Because all these methods assume that the different markers are neutral  we first discuss assumption We used two datasets to test the neutrality of markers  both resulting from plants co infected with a   ratio of Mark S and Cabb S 
The first consisted of viral DNA densitometry data derived from   plants  described above  where for each plant we have an estimate of the frequency of each marker in the genome population 
The second consisted of the restriction of   individual full genome length viral clones obtained from one co infected plant  described above  yielding an estimate of the frequency of each marker  and this was repeated on ten different plants 
The frequencies of the different markers were       and   for markers a  b  c  and d in the first dataset and       and   in the second dataset 
We tested whether these frequencies were significantly different from the expected value under neutrality    using either t tests  for datasets where normality could not be rejected  seven out of eight cases  or Wilcoxon signed rank non parametric tests otherwise  marker c in the first dataset 
In all cases p values were larger than  There are several cautionary remarks regarding these analyses 
First  in all cases we found an excess of markers 
Unfortunately  the two datasets cannot be regarded as independent because  even though the methods through which the frequency estimates were obtained were different  the plants used in the second dataset were a subset of the plants of the first 
We thus have only four independent estimates in each case  and there is minimal power to detect significant deviations from neutrality with such a small sample size 
It should be noted at this stage that deviations from the expected value could also be caused either by slight deviations from the   ratio in the infecting mixed solution  or by deviations from that ratio in the frequency of the viral particles that actually get into the plants 
Second  because of the relatively small sample sizes and low statistical power  the tests presented above could have detected only large deviations The results clearly show  however  precisely that the markers do not have large effects  if any  and that therefore recombination estimates would be affected only very slightly by any hypothetical selective effects of the markers 
Because of this  along with the fact that the introduced markers provoke silent substitutions in the CaMV genome  we assumed that markers were effectively neutral in the rest of the analysis The dataset used to estimate the recombination frequency consisted of the   full genome length viral clones   from each of ten co infected plants  individually genotyped for each of the four markers 
As discussed in detail in the Results  recombination was very frequent and concerned all four markers 
Indeed  approximately half of the genotyped clones exhibited a recombinant genotype 
It was therefore meaningful to try to obtain quantitative estimates of recombination from our data Our aim was to analyze viral recombination in a live host 
Consequently  we had to deal with the fact that more than one viral replication cycle occurred during the   d that infection lasted in our experiment  we had to wait that long for the disease to develop and to be able to recover sufficient amounts of viral DNA from each infection 
Based on the kinetics of gene expression    we postulate that each replication cycle lasts between   and   d  and that therefore seven to ten cycles occurred between infection and the sampling time 
In case this assumption is incorrect  we did calculations assuming five  seven  ten  or   replication cycles during these   d  As shown  the results were not affected qualitatively  and only slightly quantitatively 
It is important to note that we assumed that recombination occurred through a template switching mechanism  and that therefore  from a recombination point of view  the CaMV genome is linear 
The reverse transcription starts and finishes at the position   in Figure   which is the point of circularization of the DNA genome 
This implies that changes between contiguous markers a–b  b–c  and c–d can be considered as true recombination whereas those between a and d cannot  as they may simply stem from circularization of DNA  during the synthesis of which the polymerase has switched template once anywhere between a–b  b–c  or c–d To estimate the recombination rate between markers  we wrote recurrence equations describing the change in frequency of each genotype over one generation  assuming random mating and no selection  i e  the standard Wright–Fisher population genetics model 
We then expressed the frequency of all possible genotypes n generations later as a function of their initial frequency and of the recombination parameters 
Subsequently we calculated the maximum likelihood estimates of the recombination parameters and their asymptotic variances given initial frequencies  we assumed that the two  parental  genotypes  Mark S and Cabb S  had equal initial frequencies of   and that all other genotypes had initial frequencies of zero  and frequencies after n generations  the observed frequencies  as stated above we used different values of n 
All algebraic and numerical calculations were carried out with the software Mathematica The recombination parameters are the recombination rates between two adjacent loci  e g  r
  for the recombination rate between markers a and b  and the interference coefficients  e g  i
  for interference between recombination events in the segments between markers a and b and b and c  To define these parameters we followed Christiansen    and in particular the recombination distributions for two  three  and four loci  respectively  Tables     and   of   
It is important to realize that given the definitions of these parameters  the estimator of the recombination rate between two loci is not affected by the number of loci considered 
In other words  we obtain the same estimation of the recombination rate between markers a and b whether we consider genotypic frequencies at just these two loci  or the frequencies at these two loci plus a third locus  or the complete information to which we have access  the four marker genotypes 
Information on additional loci only affects the estimates of the interference coefficients It proved impossible to carry out the calculations for four loci algebraically 
Instead  we used a computer program to calculate the expected genotypic frequencies at all four loci after n generations  given the above stated initial frequencies and specified recombination parameters 
For each combination of recombination parameters we calculated a Euclidean distance between the vector of the expected genotypic frequencies and the observed genotypic frequencies  and considered that the estimated recombination parameters were those yielding the minimal Euclidean distance 
In all cases  the estimated recombination rates between pairs of loci were equal to the second decimal to those estimated algebraically from data for three or two loci Tumor Restrictions to Oncolytic VirusIn most solid tumors the tumor interior displays a high cellular density with multiple cell types  both malignant and normal  stromal  cells  interdigitated by strands of extracellular matrix  ECM  and other poorly defined tissue 
Stromal cells typically consist of fibroblasts  macrophages  neutrophils and other immune cell types 
Tumor associated fibroblasts are a source of the bulk acellular tissue in tumors    which is largely made up of polysugars and glycoproteins  such as collagens  laminins  fibronectins  proteoglycans  hyaluronan and water  forming a dense matrix around and between the cancer cells   
This matrix provides structural support but also haptotactic and chemotactic guidance for cancer cells   
Moreover  the prevailing tumor interstitium is rich in soluble angiogenic factors  such as members of the vascular endothelial growth factor  VEGF  family    cellular growth factors  including endothelial growth factor  EGF  basic fibroblast growth factor  FGF  platelet derived growth factor  PDGF  and pleiotrophic factors  particularly transforming growth factor  TGF  beta   
Additionally  both tumor  and stromal cells secrete cytokines and chemokines  such as interleukin  IL    IL   tumor necrosis factor  TNF  alpha  stromal cell derived factor  SDF    macrophage migration inhibitory factor  MIF    which on one hand recruit more stromal and progenitor cells into the tumors and on the other hand curb the activity of antigen presenting cells and anti tumor T cells   
In several independent cancer types  high serum levels of IL   and IL   are indicators of poor prognosis   Aberrant tumor and stromal growth combined with an overproduction of matrix leads to high interstitial pressure in the tumor  preventing lateral diffusion of therapeutic compounds within the tumor 
Tight cellular compactness combined with a high tumor proliferation rate also causes physical crowding and puts constraints on oxygenation  which due to aberrant angiogenesis and rupture of the haphazard vessels is mostly incomplete and results in chronic tissue hypoxia toward the tumor cores 
As cancer cells exist in a crowding hypoxic  and cytokine growth factor perpetuated chronic state of stress  they upregulate a number of key cellular molecules that function as a collective defense against a wide range of therapies  including oncolytic viruses 
The properties of oncolytic viruses and their status in clinical development as well as various delivery options have been reviewed elsewhere   
In this review  we provide an overview of two of the main intratumoral barriers to oncolytic virus spread  the extracellular tumor make up and the intracellular antiviral defense mechanisms Tumor cellular structure and composition may in concert with abundant extracellular matrix  ECM  deposition pose a severe hurdle for systemic virus entry and propagation of infection within the tumor 
The extracellular matrix is a complex dense network consisting of multiple proteins  glycoproteins and polysaccharides including collagens  laminins  fibronectins  proteoglycans and hyaluronic acid   
The interstitial fluid pressure  IFP  in the tumor surrounding blood and lymphatic vessels is mainly created by the high cell density that forms an increased physical pressure outwards and does not allow free diffusion of therapeutics   
A high IFP generally predicts an aggressive tumor phenotype as tumor cells tend to escape from tumor margins where the pressure drops  thus facilitating spread of metastatic cells   
On the other hand  for therapeutic virus  interstitial fluid concentration gradients may pose a hurdle as passive diffusion in viable regions  typically the rim  may occur mainly outward   
Given the limited arsenal of known chemicals alleviating tumor compactness and the poor penetration drugs in general into the tumor tissue  this is a considerable problem that may not be easy to tackle 
Some strategies are discussed below Viruses are passive particles and rely either on radial cell to cell spread or on soluble diffusion across concentration gradients to reach their target cells and to propagate the infection 
Tumor matrix is critical in this regard  as it can block both forms of spread 
Passively diffusing viruses may physically not fit through the strands of the ECM 
This was shown for oncolytic herpes virus  which has an outer diameter of over   nm  and whose spreading could be improved by matrix degrading bacterial collagenase co injection   
Bilbao and coworkers showed that adenovirus entry into experimental hepatocellular carcinoma nodules in the livers of immunocompetent rats following intravenous or intraportal injection was directly related to the thickness of the ECM capsule enveloping the nodules   
On the other hand  we found using Semliki Forest virus  which has an outer diameter of about   nm  that even upon intratumoral injection spread was blocked by ECM  which formed a physical barrier for virus infection  Figure  The foremost option to reduce interstitial fluid pressure and to remove physical molecule barriers imposed by the ECM is to use matrix degrading enzymes 
These act by digesting collagen  fibrin  and other types of fibrillar matrix deposits  creating more space between cell clusters  and glycosaminoglycan polymers  known to limit fluid movement in tumors 
Simultaneously  such strategies may also expose more cell surface to viruses  increasing the likelihood of infection 
In a study by Kuriyama  trypsin or collagenase dispase was injected into subcutaneous U  and U  glioma xenografts in immunocompromised mice  followed by a reporter adenovirus   
Both types of ECM degrading enzymes increased tumor transduction by the virus  but when doses got too high  transduction efficacy suffered  demonstrating a balance between ECM degradation and oncolytic virus efficacy 
In another study  treatment of PC  tumors with vaccinia virus producing matrix metalloprotease  MMP    resulted in reduction of collagen IV fibrils and increase in virus penetration into tumor  which yielded elevated virus titers   
Hong et al 
targeted orthotopic neuroblastoma xenografts engineered to express MMP  with oncolytic HSV  achieving increased virus distribution compared to control tumors   
Similar results were obtained when human soft tissue sarcoma HSTS T overexpressing MMP  or MMP  were injected with oncolytic HSV   
MMP expressing tumors contained significantly less sulfated glycosaminoglycans compared to control tumors 
Other enzymes and protein effectors  either engineered into virus expression cassettes or provided exogenously  include hyaluronidase  decorin  various other MMPs  and notably relaxin a peptide hormone normally expressed during particular phase of pregnancy that does not possess tissue degrading activity itself  but instead induces a number of key collagen degrading proteases seemingly in a tumor specific manner   
Beyer showed that relaxin expressed by murine stem cells improved trastuzumab penetrance and therapy outcome in syngeneic tumor models   
In another study  chimeric adenovirus Ad  expressing relaxin showed increased tumor transduction and virus dissemination   Several other strategies to increase penetration of therapeutics in tumors have been developed   
While the stromal ECM capsule of tumor nodules acts as a physical barrier to virus entry following intravenous injection  it was possible to improve tumor infection by administering vaso active compounds  angiotensin II  histamine  nitroglycerine  before the virus   
This is interesting  as vasculature per se would not be expected to alter or influence the physical composition of the ECM  such as collagen strand thickness 
Instead  virus access to the tumor was improved  most likely by increased access from the blood via tumor stromal adjoining vessels 
Interestingly  in a study with oncolytic herpes virus  anti VEGF monoclonal antibody Bevacizumab given before intravenous virus injection gave poorer anti tumor efficacy than when given after the virus   
The study showed that while HSV is able to enter and infect tumors better through their leaky vasculature compared to Bevacizumab normalized vasculature  vascular normalization by Bevacizumab still gave superior combination efficacy when the virus was already in the tumor 
This effect was likely dependent on altering both physical and biological properties of the tumor  including interstitial pressure and oxygenation 
In another study  anti VEGF A antibody injections in nude mice harboring U  human glioma xenografts led to an increase in MMP  expression and reduction in collagen fiber content  facilitating improved distribution of oncolytic adenovirus within the tumor tissue   
In general  targeting tumor vasculature by oncolytic viruses and including agents that affect tumor vasculature in combination regimens is gaining interest    and it will be interesting to see more specific studies on how vascular acting agents may affect the physical barriers to oncolytic viruses Some viruses do not need an extracellular step for propagating infection  such as members of the herpes and poxvirus families  and may be able to spread from cell to cell 
For example  HSV  is able to infect neighboring cells via lateral tight junctions in a manner dependent on its glycoproteins E and I   
Vaccinia virus  on the other hand  induces so called actin tails  which are actin filament driven membranous protrusions of the plasma membrane harboring a single virus particle at the outer tip 
These actin tails actively deliver and deposit virus particles onto or even into neighboring cells   
Because lateral spread without an extracellular step may circumvent neutralizing immunity as well as some of the physical obstacles the tumor microenvironment imposes  this ability has been engineered into viruses that normally do not possess it 
A promising strategy is to engineer OVs to express membrane fusogenic genes  MFGs  such as gibbon ape leukemia virus  GALV  glycoprotein  reptilian reovirus p  protein  FAST  or the membrane glycoproteins H and F of measles virus   
Quite intriguingly  expression of several different MFGs by oncolytic adenovirus synergized with chemotherapy in anti tumor efficacy both in vitro and in vivo    suggesting that membrane fusion facilitated lateral spread of also chemotherapeutics  which otherwise would not have occurred in a compact tumor 
The potential limitation of cell to cell dependent spread  however  may be that membrane free physical barriers  such as the ECM  may still pose a barrier to spread 
Also  it is unclear whether MFGs or other mechanisms of lateral spread may assist in reaching distant tumor nests Some other strategies to alleviate matrix imposed restrictions to oncolytic viruses have been discussed elsewhere   Tumors of epithelial origin mostly retain the firm cellular integrity seen in their original adhesive intercellular configuration 
Several viruses use cellular receptors which are located in paracellular tight junctions  which may be problematic in tightly packed tumors   
Adenovirus C group viruses use coxsackie adenovirus receptor  CAR  as their primary entry point  whereas adenovirus B  group members and measles virus Edmonston use CD  complement binding molecule as their cellular receptor   
Adenovirus B  group  serotypes       and   entry occurs using desmoglein   DSG    
Of these  CAR and DSG  are preferentially located within tight junctions and are hidden from virus binding   
Also the complement receptor CD  was ascribed a role in maintenance of epithelial cell integrity by interactions with the E cadherin catenin network   
These observations imply that before reaching the potential entry site on the tumor cell the virus must find its way into the junctional space 
Moreover  it has become increasingly clear that for example glioma tumors traditionally targeted by Ad  serotype adenoviruses often express only low levels of CAR and instead much higher levels of CD    Beyond that tight junctions hide multiple virus receptors  they contain a network of adhesion molecules  including ZO  cadherins  claudins and occludin  which  if perturbed  is associated with more aggressive disease in many types of cancer   
Since tight junctions also contain important receptors that mediate tumor promoting signaling and which have been targeted by monoclonal antibodies  notably Her  it would be highly useful to develop strategies that temporarily loosen the tight junction contacts even at cost of a transient increase in tumor metastatic risk 
One of the most interesting approaches has been to exploit the natural propensity of adenovirus serotype   which as part of its natural life cycle creates dodecahedral particles  PtDd  consisting of viral capsid proteins  penton base and fiber that open tight junctions by binding to and dissolving desmoglein  dimers and reducing E cadherin expression  to develop a specific tight junction opening molecule  JO    
Adenovirus type   uses PtDds to promote its own infection  opening the tight junctions ahead of infection to maximize access to desmoglein 
Analogously  when administered to human tumor xenografts  JO  facilitated penetration of trastuzumab much deeper into the tumor tissue than when the monoclonal antibody was administered on its own   
Moreover  JO  synergized with several chemotherapeutics in solid tumor models   
Backed by our own findings with oncolytic SFV  showing that both extracellular matrix and tumor cell compactness restrict virus spread and oncolytic efficacy  we believe combination approaches that target both tight junctions and extracellular matrix will prove effective in future virotherapy development  Figure  An alternative approach to increasing tumor penetration by oncolytic viruses is to alter tumor cell morphology and status 
Notably  cell death and in particular the type of cell death induced by virus has been shown to affect virus distribution within a tumor mass  in a study by Nagano et al  administration of apoptosis inducing paclitaxel before injecting oncolytic herpes simplex virus increased virus dissemination in the tumor  allowing its diffuse in  tunnels  created by shrinking dying tumor cells   Maintenance of physiological adherence is essential for proper ECM function and for retaining cellular integrity 
Therefore  a potential caveat of using ECM degrading proteolytic enzymes or tight junction openers is the risk of neoplastic cell detachment from the tumor ECM and increased risk of metastasis 
While ECM degradation or tight junction opening may operate innocuously  there is also a chance that loss of E cadherins via proteases or via non specific deregulation of tight junction integrity during ECM modulating therapy could trigger pro tumorigenic Wnt β catenin signaling  possibly driving epithelial to mesenchymal transition   
One study showed that ectopic relaxin expression stimulated MMP expression and enhanced breast cancer invasiveness    whereas another paper found short term relaxin exposure to increase breast cancer cell motility whereas long term expression reduced both motility and cancer invasiveness   
In the context of oncolytic viruses  Lavilla Alonso tested several proteases  including hyaluronidase  relaxin  and macrophage metalloelastase  and showed they all could assist adenovirus entry into tumors  yet  the authors did not detect treatment induced metastases or increase in tumor invasiveness   
Another strategy possibly balancing some of the putative risks of tight junction disruption could be to use Wnt dependent oncolytic viruses   Tumors are invariably fenestrated by host fibroblasts  myeloid cells and other non transformed cells  which driven by cancer induced cues can adopt various reprogrammed phenotypes to promote tumor angiogenesis and growth and to alter tumor responses to therapies   
As most of them normally play a role in immune homeostasis and pathogen sensing  they also respond to and influence oncolytic virus infection of tumors Fulci et al 
reported that injection of oncolytic HSV  directly into glioblastoma tumor parenchyma triggered upregulation of CD  and CD  monocytic markers and rapid clearance of virus  likely executed by infiltrating phagocytic cells   
When clodronate liposomes were used to deplete macrophages in vivo  the authors observed a  fold increase in virus titers in the brain tumors concomitant with an   reduction in peripheral CD  macrophages in animal spleens  suggesting that CD  cells migrate into the tumors upon virus injection and limit overall oncolytic efficacy 
While CD  cells were not reduced by peripheral macrophage depletion  arguing that these cells had been recruited to the tumors before the treatment  they could be eliminated in live glioma slices ex vivo  resulting in a  fold increase in virus replication 
Macrophages may secrete antiviral type I interferon constitutively at very low  subnanomolar  levels   and recently Liu et al 
showed that tumor resident CD  macrophages induced a protective antiviral state in ovarian and breast tumors which led to resistance to oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus  VSV  infection   
Type I IFN signaling  JAK  inhibitor Ruxolitinib reversed the resistance  facilitating VSV replication in the macrophage protected cancer cells 
It is tempting to speculate that tumor resident macrophages also rendered syngeneic GL  and DBT mouse gliomas completely refractory to VA  oncolytic alphavirus  as these cells were quite infectable in vitro and live glioma slices regained their sensitivity to virus within   h  indicating dilution of IFN I   Macrophages or the closely related myeloid suppressor cells are the predominant stromal cell type in many tumors and are actively recruited during cancer progression   
Heavy macrophage presence in the tumors indicates that such tumors may be resistant to oncolytic virotherapy  unless depleting preconditioning would be used 
Moreover  as part of the early immune response to virus infection  monocytic cells are rapidly recruited to tumors following intratumoral virus injection 
In one study  depletion of either CD b  cells or VEGF secreted by these cells in mice treated with oncolytic HSV  greatly increased oncolytic efficacy  tentatively linking pro tumorigenic and antiviral angiogenic mechanisms   Another key pro tumorigenic signaling employed by many tumors is up regulation of CXCR  the receptor for chemokine CXCL   also known as SDF  and recruitment of stromal cells expressing CXCL  which maintain the tumor and recruit additional cells to support tumor expansion and invasion  such as endothelial cell progenitors which contribute to neovascularization   
Indeed  high CXCR  expression is a negative prognostic factor for many cancers 
Oncolytic vaccinia virus engineered to express a soluble antagonist of CXCR  showed improved intratumoral virus replication  increased vascular disruption and a markedly reduced infiltration of the tumors by putative immune suppressive and tumor promoting stromal cells   
This study highlights how reducing pro tumor stromal cell effects may alleviate antiviral resistance and yield increased overall therapeutic efficacy 
On the other hand  if the paracrine antiviral effects of tumor homing monocytic cells could be selectively abrogated these cells could favorably be used to ferry oncolytic viruses into tumors 
Indeed  a significant delay in metastatic tumor potential was achieved when macrophages were harnessed to deliver a tumor specific oncolytic adenovirus   What is the antiviral status in human cancer 
Recent analyses from different normal cells that occupy the same organ reveal striking functional variation in components of the type I IFN signaling pathway that correlate with the tissue tropism and virulence of some virus strains   
Can similar variation in such components be found in cancer cells  or do cancer cells make an exception Transformed cells undergo selective elimination by the immune system before becoming cancerous  termed immunoediting  based on observations of differential capacity of immunocompetent mice to reject tumors previously grown in immunocompromised hosts versus syngeneic animals   
Cancer cell responsiveness to type I and type II IFNs plays a role during immunoediting  cancer cells that eventually progress to form a tumor display reduced capacity to respond to IFN gamma  which otherwise would upregulate MHC class I molecules and render the tumors amenable to CD  T cell mediated destruction  whereas responsiveness to type I interferon initially helps tumors avoid immune purging during the editing phase and is then irrelevant   
Of note  the anti tumor effects of type I IFN  still exploited today in several cancers  were shown to depend on host NK cells  and mice in which IFNAR was blocked by monoclonal antibody failed to reject even highly immunogenic tumors  as opposed to mice treated with control antibody  who all rejected the immunogenic tumor challenge   
Thus  whereas tumor responsiveness to type I IFN is not predetermined after immunoediting  other factors post immunoediting may influence it In several tumor types  varying levels of expression of components of the type I IFN signaling cascade have been detected  and in some tumor types these components have been found to have prognostic value  whereas in others they do not seem to influence survival   
However  emerging data suggests that antiviral genes may predict poor survival because they increase treatment resistance 
In one study  poor prognosis of several types of cancer due to genotoxic treatment resistance was found to correlate with increased activity of IFN I pathway genes   
In this study  a triad of type I IFN signaling pathway genes  STAT  ISG  and IFIT  formed a pan tumor type negative prognostic factor  and a broader seven gene cluster established negative prognostic criteria for treatment resistant breast cancer 
Treatment resistance was subsequently shown to depend on STAT  signaling  STAT expressing tumor clones were positively selected in animals in vivo  demonstrating increased proliferation and metastatic potential  and STAT expression mediated resistance against genotoxic assault by doxorubicin or ionizing radiation  knockdown of STAT  resulted in lower proliferation rate and metastatic capacity and increased sensitivity to genotoxic stress    
In another study  resistance to epigenetic DNA modifiers  AZA dC  a methyltransferase inhibitor  and LBH  or MGCD  both histone deacetylase  HDAC  inhibitors  was correlated with increased expression of IFN I pathway genes in small lung cancer cells   
Basal IFN related gene expression in several different SML cell lines was upregulated Interestingly  in many cancers  STAT proteins are not phosphorylated and persist in unphosphorylated form  U STAT 
Like its phosphorylated counterpart  U STAT  increases expression of genes contributing to resistance to DNA damaging agents   
While it is currently unknown why cancers may prefer to use unphosphorylated forms  it is known that U STATs activate distinct signals compared to their phosphorylated counterparts 
However  importantly for oncolytic viruses  in many tumors  constant expression and release of type I IFN leads to a constitutively high level of unphosphorylated forms of STAT  STAT  and IRF  which together form an unphosphorylated but functional ISGF like complex that relocalizes to the nucleus and drives expression of a specific set of ISGs distinct from acute IFN I exposure   
These ISGs are sufficient to maintain a functional antiviral defense and they play a critical role in resistance to DNA damaging agents On a cellular level  virus replication is controlled by antiviral defense molecules    which in turn are primarily controlled by type I IFN signaling 
In addition to classical type I IFN  or cytokine induced antiviral signaling  tumors may employ other antiviral defense mechanisms 
For example  stromal cells may secrete peptides with antiviral properties called defensins   
The defensins are amphiphatic and typically  –  amino acids in length and interfere with viruses by physically binding to and disrupting virus particles and or by inducing antiviral responses in target cells via pattern recognition receptors 
At least oral squamous cell carcinomas were found to overexpress defensins compared to normal control tissues   
While the role of defensins in oncolytic virus infection of tumors is unclear  one study showed that the immune stimulating properties of defensins may be exploited to increase overall therapeutic efficacy 
In this study  expression of beta   defensin from a conditionally replicating adenovirus yielded a superior therapeutic entity compared to the unarmed parental virus via enhanced anti tumor immune responses mediated by TLR dependent activation of dendritic cells   In summary  human cancers display varying degrees of expression of antiviral proteins or their signaling regulators at baseline 
Some of these may increase in response to genotoxic anti cancer treatments 
In the next chapter we will highlight some of the consequences to oncolytic virotherapy of the heterogeneity in type I IFN responsiveness in tumor cells All oncolytic viruses tested to date display variable infectivity in different cancer cell lines 
This variability is likely at least partly dependent on type I IFN as most oncolytic viruses are IFN sensitive 
IFN secretion follows virus sensing by the cells via Toll like receptors expressed on both the plasma membrane and in endocytotic vesicles  NOD like receptors  STING  AIM  NLP inflammosome and other danger sensing molecules  summarized elsewhere   
While all viruses carry an arsenal of counteracting molecules    no virus goes completely undetected 
Even HSV amplicons  which are devoid of functional virus genes  induce a type I IFN response that mediates a STAT dependent system wide antiviral defense in mice within one hour of intravenous vector injection  resulting in significant reduction of transgene expression compared to expression in STAT  knockout animals   During our own studies with attenuated SFV vector VA  it became apparent that the dramatic and lasting therapeutic efficacy achieved following mere single intravenous  or intratumoral  injection of the virus in immunocompromised mice bearing human A  melanoma or U  glioma xenografts   was not going to be recapitulated easily in immunocompetent animals   
The paradox in our studies was that while oncolytic SFV vector VA  effectively replicated in and destroyed a variety of IFN responsive cancer cell lines in vitro  it consistently failed to eradicate tumors generated from the same cell types in vivo  even if large doses of virus were injected directly into the tumor mass and even if the tumors were void of visible physical barriers  Figure  
Conversely  only tumors generated from IFN unresponsive cancer cells have seemed infectable in vivo by VA  so far 
In light of earlier findings by others  showing that type I IFN receptor knockout mice are highly susceptible to SFV infection and quickly succumb to multi organ systemic infection    the parameters for oncolytic SFV efficacy seem clear  tumor cells must be defective in type I IFN response for the virus to be effective These findings are in line with emerging data from other groups  showing a remarkably strict dependence of oncolytic virus replication on defective type I IFN responsiveness  a dogma introduced at the turn of the  st century   
For example  sarcomas and melanomas display differing permissiveness to oncolytic VSV  an obstacle which may be overcome by blocking type I IFN signaling   
In eight sarcoma cell lines  basal up regulation of RIG I and IFIT  and rapid induction of STAT  phosphorylation upon IFN I treatment correlated with resistance to oncolytic measles virus   
In other studies  human pancreatic and ovarian cancer cells display resistance against Rb dependent oncolytic adenovirus  strongly correlating with intracellular levels of MxA  and acquired resistance to repeated oncolytic adenovirus injections in an intraperitoneal ovarian carcinoma model was associated with an increase in MxA as well as several other key ISGs in the tumors   
A study comparing normal human or mouse melanocytes to a panel of melanoma cells revealed strong correlation between permissiveness to oncolytic VSV and capacity to mount antiviral defense in response to type I IFN   
In this study  VSV rp  harboring two mutations in P and L genes  was superior to several other tested oncolytic VSV strains  but the dependence on defective IFN responsiveness was still retained 
In yet another study  oncolytic VSV replicated in four out of twelve mesothelioma cell lines which were unable to mount antiviral defense upon IFN beta pretreatment or to respond to infection by up regulation of PKR  MxA or  OAS mRNA   
In contrast  the non permissive mesothelioma cells mounted antiviral defense  associated with PKR  MxA or  OAS mRNA up regulation  in response to infection or to exogenous type I IFN 
The authors of this study further linked the observed pattern of virus resistance to clinical mesothelioma samples  where in a mesothelioma tissue array  significant variance in immunoreactivity against PKR  p  and or IFNAR was observed  with only a few samples displaying lack of reactivity against all three components  arguing that most tumors in clinical settings would display at least some level of resistance to oncolytic VSV Oncolytic adenoviruses are often deleted for E A  which normally binds Rb and prevents it from sequestering E F  which results in the viruses being unable to replicate in normal cells 
However  since adenovirus  as with all viruses  contains elements that antagonize antiviral defenses  such elements have also been targets for deletion to render the virus sensitive to innate antiviral defenses  which would be expected to remain intact only in normal cells 
Cancer cells expressing Ras may down regulate protein kinase R and inhibit type I IFN induction by interfering with RIG I signaling   
Also  select interferon stimulated genes appear to be repressed by the Ras MEK ERK signaling cascade   
PKR activation shuts down E F dependent translation  including translation of virus messenger RNAs 
Therefore  an adenovirus deleted for VA RNA  which antagonizes PKR  should be capable of replicating in Ras overexpressing  tumor  cells 
However  while this was seemingly the case    it was later discovered that Ras is not an obligatory determinant for PKR inactivation and that virus replication was halted even in Ras overexpressing cells via functional PKR mediated E F phosphorylation  implying that the parameters of VA RNA deleted adenovirus replication had to be revised   
Similar findings were obtained with oncolytic reovirus  against which Ras independent tumor resistance emerged in vivo   
Thus  under some circumstances even tumor cells over expressing Ras may respond to type I IFN or to stimulants of pattern recognition receptors  activating PKR and inhibiting virus translation 
To complicate matters  MEK inhibitors have been shown restore antiviral signaling capacity in Ras overexpressing tumors   
This implies that human tumors treated with MEK inhibitors  such as Trametinib which was recently approved for treatment of BRAF mutated melanoma  may be poor targets for oncolytic viruses as antiviral signaling capacity in such tumors may be restored Some oncolytic viruses  such as members of the poxvirus family  are seemingly resistant to the antiviral effects of type I IFNs in vitro and may be controlled by other cellular factors   
However  in most cases  sensitivity or resistance to type I IFN is assessed in vitro and using only one cytokine  which may mask synergies with other factors present in vivo 
One possible explanation for the in vitro–in vivo discrepancy is the tumor micro environment  which not only imposes physical barriers to oncolytic viruses but also alters intracellular antiviral defenses 
For example  glioma cells were found in the brain to spontaneously secrete type I IFN  which conferred resistance against oncolytic HSV 
Resistance was linked to ECM protein CCN  interaction with glioma cell surface receptor alpha   beta   integrin  which activated interferon secretion   
It is tempting to speculate whether this or a similar ECM glioma interaction could have contributed to the resistance of syngeneic glioma cells we observed in vivo but not in vitro to both oncolytic SFV and vaccinia virus  FIG    
Also  while critical in many respects  antiviral signaling may occur without signaling via type I IFN receptor  IFNAR 
For instance  upon infection of IFNAR KO mice with murine hepatitis virus  MHV  brain cells were found to have upregulated antiviral GTPase TGTP and IFITm  and IFITm  all of which have confirmed antiviral activity in vivo against a variety of viruses   
In these cases  IFN gamma and TNF alpha likely account for at least part of the observed ISG activity  where e g  TGTP is upregulated by IFN γ signaling and TNFα has been shown to induce ISG  independently of IFNAR   Interestingly  while most cancers are heterogeneous in antiviral defence signaling  one broad class of tumors in particular may display consistently low capacity to ward off oncolytic viruses  oncovirus induced cancers 
This is because oncoviruses  as all viruses  carry a complement of factors that abrogate antiviral sensors and effectors  which may result in tumors that are uniformly devoid of antiviral signaling 
In an intriguing study  oncolytic VSV infected and destroyed human papilloma virus  HPV positive cervical carcinoma cells more effectively than HPV negative head  and neck cancer cells due to HPV E mediated suppression of antiviral signaling   
HPV positive or E expressing xenografts were efficiently eradicated from nude mice following VSV injection 
The potential of this approach is that even oncolytic viruses that are extremely sensitive to type I IFN  such as attenuated SFV or M mutated VSV  may function well against oncovirus induced cancers where the oncovirus machinery ensures the lack of antiviral defense While on first thought it would appear counterintuitive to antagonize the very factors that keep oncolytic viruses tumor specific  emerging data shows that this can be accomplished in a safe way 
One of the foremost strategies to increase oncolytic virus efficacy is to combine them with drugs that lower tumor antiviral defenses 
In this regard  a primary target for interference is the prototypical type I IFN signaling cascade 
While small molecular inhibitors against IFNAR are not available  activity of downstream signaling transducers may effectively be blocked 
Human pancreatic cancer cells were shown to constitutively express high levels of MxA and OAS and to mount type I IFN dependent resistance to oncolytic VSV 
Resistance could be overcome by blocking activity of IFNAR associated Janus kinase  JAK      
Similarly  JAK  inhibitor ruxolitinib overcame type I IFN dependent resistance of human SCC  head and neck cancer cells against oncolytic VSV   
Ruxolitinib also successfully abrogated type I IFN mediated antiviral effects elicited by macrophages    highlighting that this drug might also alleviate type I IFN dependent tumor resistance to oncolytic viruses imposed by stromal cells 
However  the obvious downside to using JAK inhibitors is their effects on critical host defense mechanisms  which may result in increased infection of normal cells 
Moreover  JAK inhibitors may reduce anti tumor immune responses elicited by oncolytic virotherapy 
For example  ruxolitinib was shown to impair the capacity of dendritic cells promote CD  T cell responses against model tumor antigens   
On the other hand  in this study clearance of adenovirus was delayed in ruxolitinib treated normal animals  which makes it difficult to predict the overall impact of JAK inhibitors on tumor therapy where prolonged virus presence might translate to better therapeutic efficacy 
Also  while the immune stimulating and anti tumor effects of type I and type II interferons may be adversely affected by JAK inhibitors  central tumor promoting cascades mediated by JAKs  such as IL STAT  may also be inhibited    yielding a difficult to predict net therapeutic outcome 
At the moment  more studies are needed to establish the overall impact of interference with JAK  signaling in cancer therapy Spurred by earlier reports of oncovirus reactivation and promoter enhancement by histone deacetylase  HDAC  inhibitors  this class of agents was assessed for capacity to enhance oncolytic virus potency by inhibiting antiviral responses 
Indeed  such enhancement was observed with oncolytic VSV and SFV  and while it has been difficult to pinpoint the exact mechanisms that underlie HDAC inhibitor enhancement of oncolytic virus replication in cancer cells  antiviral defenses in general are inhibited for yet unknown reasons mainly in cancer cells and not in normal cells  which indirectly facilitates virus replication   
Interestingly  combination of HDAC inhibitors with conditionally replicating   E A deleted adenovirus gave improved virus replication rate and therapeutic efficacy in subcutaneous xenograft models only when the inhibitors were given before the virus  otherwise inhibition of replication was observed   
Similarly  HDAC inhibitors increased replication and oncolytic efficacy of HSV when given before the virus but not when given at the same time   
With nuclear DNA viruses  such as adenovirus and HSV  it is possible that HDAC inhibitors also alter virus genome accessibility to transcription factors  resulting in reduced replication or other adverse effects  implying that with these viruses HDAC inhibitors should be administered before the viruses Recently  it was found that HDAC inhibitor vorinostat activates NfκB signaling by facilitating hyperacetylation of the p  subunit  which in turn activates cellular autophagy   
Autophagy was in another study shown to be important for VSV replication  presumably by inhibiting antiviral signaling 
This is interesting  as a previous study revealed enhancement of VSV replication by inhibiting TNF alpha induced antiviral signaling mediated by p  using NfκB inhibitors BMS  or TPCA    
In this study  neither inhibitor had an effect on STAT  or STAT  phosphorylation or their nuclear relocalization in response to type I IFN but the authors observed clear induction of ISG  GBP  and MX  in response to type I IFN in U  glioma cells  with the latter two being dependent on NfκB signaling 
Taken together  NfκB pathway activation may result in different antiviral responses in different cancer types  and inhibition or enhancement of oncolytic viruses by NfκB inhibitors is dependent on other concomitant cellular mechanisms  such as autophagy Since HDAC inhibitors modulate promoter activity accessibility  it is conceivable other epigenetic or promoter modifying agents could work in a similar manner to repress antiviral defense induction and enhance oncolytic viruses   
DNA demethylating agents  azacytidine  Aza  and decitabine synergized with oncolytic herpes simplex type   virus in glioma models in vitro and in vivo  as did HDAC inhibitor valproic acid  VPA  which was already shown before to work well with oncolytic HSV as well as several other oncolytic viruses   
Moreover  inhibition of cancer antiviral defenses  specifically RNAseL and PKR  resulted when cancer cells were exposed to sunitinib  a multi tyrosine kinase inhibitor originally developed as an inhibitor of VEGF R and PDGF R signaling  yielding strong anti tumor synergy with IFN sensitive oncolytic VSV   
Since sunitinib is approved for renal cell carcinoma and imatinib resistant gastric cancers  combination with oncolytic VSV constitutes a promising and clinically relevant approach warranting further investigation 
Interstingly  sunitinib as well as several other receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors displayed antiviral effects against polyomavirus BK    arguing that these compounds are not universal virus enhancers Cyclophosphamide  CPA  is a general immunosuppressant used to minimize Treg presence during immunotherapy and also oncolytic virotherapy 
CPA may  however  also enhance replication and efficacy of oncolytic viruses by diminishing cytokine secretion by stromal cells  including type I IFN   
Another compound enhancing oncolytic virus efficacy by lowering cell responsiveness to type I IFN is triptolide  which acts downstream of IRF  activation   
Further  the kinase mammalian target of rapamycin  mTOR  enhances the antiviral effects of type I IFN by activation of its effector proteins  E BP  which binds and inactivates translation factor eIF E  and S K  which carries out cell type specific signaling functions of type I IFN  such as activation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor  B and promotion of ISG  transcription 
Consequently  rapamycin was able to enhance oncolytic VSV replication and anti tumor efficacy by inhibiting type I IFN mediated antiviral signaling via mTOR   Several other compounds synergizing with oncolytic viruses have been identified via high throughput drug library screening  many of which seem to act by antagonizing antiviral defenses 
For instance  a novel virus sensitizer  Vse  was found to greatly diminish antiviral effects of type I IFN against oncolytic VSV in several cancer cell types  and the drug also synergized with the virus in subcutaneous mouse tumor models   
For many of these new compounds  the mechanism of action is still poorly understood  necessitating extensive safety studies to exclude undesirable effects against normal cells Apart from classical type I IFN induced antiviral defenses  which typically prevent virus translation and degrade virus genomes  other cellular machineries regulate oncolytic virus efficacy 
Notably  strategies to increase cancer cell death in response to oncolytic viruses have been tested 
In a recent study  a class of compounds called SMAC mimetics synergized in several cancer models with oncolytic VSV by removing cancer cell block to apoptosis in response to virus induced type I IFN  TNF α or TRAIL   
Interestingly  since virus infection triggered cytokines act on nearby non infected cells  SMAC mimetics may in combination with oncolytic viruses also cause significant bystander tumor destruction 
Normal cells are not affected by the IFN SMAC mimetic synergy  providing an important safety aspect 
In another study  blocking the ER stress response circuitry triggered by oncolytic rhabdovirus infection by a small molecular inhibitor of serine threonine protein kinase and endoribonuclease IRE α  which was identified in a genome wide siRNA screen  greatly enhanced cytotoxicity via caspase induced apoptosis and increased oncolytic efficacy in refractory tumor models in mice   
This effect was independent on induction or responsiveness to type I IFN 
Conversely  inhibitors of nucleoside transporter   ENT  were discovered from a high throughput screen of enhancers of oncolytic HSV  and to date such inhibitors have not been reported to alter cellular antiviral responses   
Other compounds  such as common chemotherapeutics  and their mechanisms synergizing with oncolytic viruses have been discussed elsewhere for most of them the possible role of antiviral defense antagonism in enhancing oncolytic virus efficacy remains to be studied   Thus  many compounds are available to interfere with tumor antiviral defenses 
The outstanding question for most of them  however  seems to be why such compounds do not render normal cells sensitive to oncolytic viruses 
Elucidation of the exact mechanisms of action and the differences between normal and cancer cells constitute a worthy goal for studies in the near future Already in the  s it became clear that using certain pathogenic wildtype viruses  such as West Nile virus and Bunyamwera virus  in cancer patients would result in off target toxicity   
Characteristic for pathogenic viruses is a greater ability to circumvent or antagonize cellular innate antiviral defenses than attenuated strains 
For example  unlike the prototypical oncolytic reovirus strain type   Dearing  the T L strain of reovirus causes accumulation of IRF  in the nucleus and inhibits activation of a select group of ISGs yet because of this property the T L strain is myocarditic unlike the oncolytic type   Dearing strain   
For these reasons  many oncolytic viruses used today  such as reovirus type   Dearing  oncolytic strains of Newcastle disease virus and M mutated VSV have either a stronger capacity to induce or a weaker capacity to resist antiviral type I IFN than the corresponding wildtype strains   An open question  however  is whether strain specific or virus specific differences that relate to specific components of the cellular antiviral machinery may be exploited for greater anti tumor efficacy  i e  if one virus fails  could another be used in its stead 
While Ras expression was critical for oncolytic reovirus replication in cells overexpressing CUG  oncogene  oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus was unable to replicate in the same cells due to increased activation of STAT  and OASL    
Thus  in these cells reovirus was not affected by STAT  or OASL  and it therefore remains interesting to see which other antiviral effectors may have been lacking in the CUG expressing cells and  conversely  how reovirus and VSV differ in terms of sensitivity to antiviral effectors 
While several oncolytic viruses have been compared to each other in terms of replication rate and cytotoxicity  systematic studies with regard to tumor antiviral defenses have not been conducted As any attenuated virus is likely to replicate effectively only in its own niche  i e  to be restricted by a specific set of ISGs  and as wild type strains may be too toxic for use in humans  a compromise may be achieved by incorporating select elements from wild type viruses into oncolytic virus backbones 
Indeed  several chimeric and recombinant viruses have been generated that harbor specific elements of wild type strains or even of other unrelated viruses in order to better resist cancer antiviral defenses  Table  
As an example of introducing wild type elements into attenuated viruses  Haralambieva reported on a measles virus Edmonston vaccine strain in which P gene was replaced with the counterpart from the wild type IC B strain   
Later  Meng et al 
included N  P  and L genes from wild type measles in Edmonston backbone  producing an enhanced but still safe oncolytic virus   
Edmonston vaccine virus induces a more robust IFN response compared to wild type measles virus partly due to the weaker ability of V protein to suppress MDA mediated activation of IRF  and IFN I induction   
In vivo  P gene encoded proteins  particularly V  control the quality of the cytokine response to measles so that vaccine strains qualitatively induce a stronger inflammatory response compared to WT strains  where WT V protein suppresses multiple cytokine secretion 
V protein short cytoplasmic tail has been shown to bind and inactivate STAT  IRF  MDA  and the Rel homology domain of the NfκB subunit p  but not of p    
Also  V causes LGP  protein to bind and inactivate RIG I    but it seemingly does not interfere with TICAM   TRIF  multiple TLR adaptor  including TLR mediated IFN β induction 
Thus  if cancer and normal cells would differ with regard to TICAM  or IRF  then such a virus could potentially target specifically cancer cells rather than normal cells 
So far  the measles Edmonston WT chimeras have proven safe in animals As an example of heterologous virus constructs  lentogenic Newcastle disease virus engineered to express influenza virus PR   H N  NS  showed enhanced oncolytic efficacy in vivo due to dampening of antiviral responses   
While such a virus did not display enhanced pathogenicity in that study  a mesogenic NDV virus harboring NS  from influenza strain H N  did show increased pathogenicity in chickens as well as an increased ability to replicate in human cells    raising some cautionary warnings for future engineering of similar replicative viruses 
As another example  vaccinia virus soluble type I IFN scavenger B R  NOTE  B R is often used in the literature  has been engineered into both oncolytic HSV and oncolytic rhabdoviruses  resulting in all cases in more effective therapy agents without loss of tumor specificity   
Oncolytic γ  gene deleted HSV was complemented by two different PKR antagonists from human cytomegalovirus  TRS  and IRS  generating a chimera capable of reaching wild type virus replication levels in cancer cells in vitro and in tumor models in vivo   The selection of various viral IFN I antagonists that potentially could be used to augment attenuated oncolytic viruses is vast   
For example  increased replication of several viruses  including HIV  Sindbis virus and E deleted adenovirus in mammalian cells was observed when the cells were engineered to express vaccinia virus E L protein  influenza A virus NS  protein  ebola virus VP  protein or HIV  Tat protein   
The choice of antagonist must primarily be made with safety in mind  but virus specific and cell specific differences in antagonist functions may potentially be exploited rationally when considering the overall combination 
For example  vaccinia virus E L is able to rescue VSV but not EMCV from exogenous IFN  whereas vaccinia virus K L partially rescued EMCV but not VSV   In anticipation of systematic  perhaps bioinformatically guided   super chimera  studies  two or more viruses that may complement each other s shortcomings in antiviral defense antagonism have been considered 
Notably  vaccinia virus was favorably combined with IFN I sensitive oncolytic VSV and SFV  yielding tumor model dependent increases in overall therapy efficacy that were dependent on vaccinia virus antagonism of type I IFN responses  which increased the replication of the IFN sensitive viruses   
Such heterologous virotherapy approaches may also be used to generate immunological synergy  similar to heterologous prime boost vaccination  anti tumor immune responses may be increased due to targeting of the tumor by two different viruses  on two separate occasions  but anti virus immune responses would be generated against different viruses each time  avoiding the problem of neutralizing immunity to and predominance of antivirus immune responses   
Some other ideas explored experimentally include engineering oncolytic viruses to express other oncolytic viruses 
For example  the entire oncolytic parvovirus H  genome was placed under a regulatable promoter in oncolytic adenovirus  resulting in a more effective therapeutic entity than either virus alone without loss of tumor specificity   
The genetic material of Semliki Forest virus replicons has been engineered into adenovirus and vaccinia virus backbones   and several other virus chimeras have been constructed   
However  the effects on tumor antiviral defenses of such a constructs remain to be studied The attribute  oncolytic  implies for a virus that it infects and  indeed  lyses the infected tumor 
This property is primarily tested in vitro in cultured tumor cells 
We have learned  however  that in the native tumor microenvironment in living hosts many viruses are no longer able to infect tumor cells or to kill them even if they manage to infect them 
Tightly packed tumor cells and the network of supportive molecules of the extracellular matrix form a physical barrier to virus particle diffusion 
It has also become evident that the tumor cells themselves may be much more capable of thwarting oncolytic virus advances than previously thought  with some tumor cells residing in a seemingly permanent non permissive antiviral state 
Tumors harbor multiple cell types in addition to the neoplastic cells  which may promote and propagate both physical and cellular virus resistance 
As the efficacy of virotherapy in human cancer patients still falls shy of the achievements in animal models  it appears quite plausible that one or more of the barriers described in this review indeed constitute a real and formidable obstacle for oncolytic virus advancement into routine clinical use 
Fortunately  some of the most difficult barriers have been identified  and a rapidly expanding arsenal of countermeasures is at our disposal 
Our task is now to separate the wheat from the chaff and to systematically evaluate the proposed combination regimens that will yield the best results without compromising patient safety Evidence of prenatal toxicity of herbal based indigenous formulations for sex selection in rat modelsTraditional or indigenous preparations  IPs  are getting considerable attention in global health debates  It continues to be used widely in several countries and its consumption is rapidly increasing 
 
  Many reports have documented the use of such preparations 
For instance  in China  traditional herbal medicines played a critical role during the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome  SARS  In fact  many drugs in modern medicine had their roots in the traditional system of medicine 
Drugs like Penicillin  from Penicillium fungi  and Digoxin  from Digitalis purpurea  are some such examples 
One of the promising therapies for Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus  MRSA  infection is a ninth century treatment for eye infections which is a recipe consisting of garlic and onions  wine  and bile from a cow s stomach brewed in a brass cauldron 
It is however important to note that culture specific practices are not always safe 
Digitalis is a classic example where herbalists use this plant in allopathic treatment strategies  while in some countries such as Britain  law restricts their vast availability  A report from Australia describes the adverse effects of ‘herbal  preparations or IPs  Problems arise when people do not report about the consumption of such preparations assuming that these are devoid of any side effects by virtue of them being natural products  The need for research in this field is huge and scientific research into the quality  safety  molecular effects and clinical efficacy is crucial 
 
 
Pregnancy is considered a time of minimal intervention  and a period when herbal medicines are usually contraindicated  It is reported that many women consume indigenous medicines  that contains Bryonia laciniosa  Quercus infectoria and Putranjiva roxburghii along with other ingredients  during early pregnancy to beget a male child in India 
These preparations  often called sex selection drugs  SSD  contain herbal ingredients but these are off the label prescriptions and hence cannot be certified as ‘herbal  medicines 
The prevalence of consumption varies from   to as high as         Studies have indicated that there is  –  times higher risk of birth defects including major malformations of internal organs like urogenital and renal malformation  trachea esophageal fistula  and visible defects like spina bifida  cleft lip palate and imperforate anus 
 
  Risk of stillbirths also increases   folds 
Studies suggest that a single exposure during pregnancy can be deleterious 
 
 
 
  SSDs are reported to contain phytoestrogens  steroids and heavy metals 
 
 
 
  It is also known that although placenta serves as a barrier  most drugs and environmental chemicals enter the foetal circulation by passive diffusion or active transport  However  despite growing evidence on deleterious effects of these herbal formulations  few studies have attempted to systematically understand the risk of such preparations using animal models 
Genetic sex of a child is determined at the time of conception by the fertilization of the ovum with X or Y sperms and intake of so called preparations for sex selection can never alter that In view of these  the current study was conducted with an objective to determine the embryo foetal and development toxicity of SSDs following maternal exposure during critical period of organogenesis using a small animal model The study was guided by the OECD guidelines for testing of chemicals  Guideline no    adopted on  nd January   Prenatal Developmental Toxicity Study  and was based on a mutually approved protocol 
Personal protection equipment was employed as required while handling the test system The test facility is registered and renewed  No 
 PO RcBi S CPCSEA dated July     for breeding and to conduct research on animals for commercial purpose by the committee for the purpose of control and supervision of experiments on animals  CPCSEA  Ministry of Environment  Forests and Climate Change  Government of India 
The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee  Venus Medicine Research Center 
Due permission was taken from the Ethics Committee of Indian Institute of Public Health Delhi For this experiment  strain of Sprague Dawley of rats  Rattus norvegicus  was used 
The number of dams per group was   instead of   as laid down under OECD guidelines 
Rats of both sexes  –  g  were obtained from National Institute of Biologicals  India at  –  weeks of age  acclimatized for five days and then subjected to the experiment at  –  weeks of age 
They were housed in standard polypropylene rat cages with stainless steel top grill  one dam per cage  at a temperature of       °C  with  –  relative humidity 
Bedding material and cages were changed once in six days and   hourly light dark cycle was followed 
Animals were identified by their existing ear numbering 
Cages were labelled by tags indicating the study number  sex  group of the animals  experimental start and completion dates 
Standard pelleted feed  from Ashirwad Industries  Mohali  India  was provided ad libitum to all the animals 
They also had free access to purified water via drinking bottles throughout the study 
The feed  cages and drinking bottles were not analysed for the presence of phytoestrogens and bisphenol A 
However  similar materials were used for all the rats across all groups The drug comprised of IPs for sex selection  SSD 
These non branded locally made preparations are made available  –  days after placing an order and are never sold openly 
These preparations essentially contain herbal ingredients such as Shivlingi  Bryonia laciniosa  Majuphal  Quercus infectoria  Putrajeevak  Putranjiva roxburghii  Nagkesar  Mesua ferrea  and feather of peacock  Pavo cristatus 
A total of   such samples of SSDs were procured from varied sources like ‘pansari  shop owners  grocers  local alternative medicine practitioners  rickshaw pullers  drivers and commoners from different states 
SSDs are advised to be consumed between   and   weeks of pregnancy The samples were categorized into   groups based on redundancy of the preparations and common ingredients reported 
This was followed by chemical analysis in an accredited laboratory to detect the presence of phytoestrogens and steroids 
Since we explored the toxic effects of these preparations we wanted to select two samples that would be most predictive of toxicity 
Due to resource constraints  we did not want to subject all the   samples for animal study 
Hence  three samples of SSDs  found to be most rich in phenols and steroids were selected for toxicity study  All the three samples were also tested for heavy metals which suggested that Lead and Mercury were in very high quantities  The toxicity was examined using C  elegans  an alternate animal model 
Survival analysis and reproductive toxicity was assessed from the brood size and progeny count assay  The two SSDs that were found to be most toxic were selected as test items for the subsequent study in rat models 
SSD   was reported to contain Shivlingi and Putrajeevak while SSD   contained Shivlingi  Majuphal  Putrajeevak  Nagkesar and feathers of peacock 
Both the samples were obtained from grocers 
Local preparations like these are bound to have certain degree of variability in concentrations but more often than not  these remain the major ingredients According to studies reported  women consume such preparations along with cow s milk in dosages and schedule that are quite varied 
While some advise these IPs to be consumed for one day  others prescribe it for   days  to be taken thrice a day 
We considered the amount of SSDs most commonly reported by pregnant women  weighing   kg  which was  –  g daily for   days 
The dose of the test item   mg kg  was calculated by using conversion factor of  Conversion factor is the ratio of the correction factors  estimated by dividing the average body weight in kgs of species by the body surface area in m  of the species  Km 
Human equivalent dose  HED in mg kg    Animal dose  mg kg  X correction factor  Km animal Km human 
Kms of every species are constant 
For humans it is    assuming average weight of adults to be   kg a surface area of   m  and for rats it is  Therefore  HED   mg  kg    animal dose X  
Or  animal dose         mg kg           mg kg Since pregnant women consume these orally  these were administered to rats by oral route The test items were coded as SSD   and SSD   and were provided to the experimental laboratory  Venus Medicine Research Center  Baddi  in powder form 
On the day of dosing  the doses were administered between  –  h  The test items were administered in fresh cow s milk at a final volume of   ml kg 
The doses were calculated on the basis of the latest body weight recorded for the study 
A stainless steel gavage cannula fitted to a calibrated syringe was used for dosing the animals For control animals  cow s milk was used as a vehicle while feeding The study was performed in two phases to evaluate the effect of SSD consumption duration during gestation period Adult  nulliparous female rats were mated with males of same species and strain in  
Each morning  dams were examined for the presence of a vaginal plug and vaginal smear was taken from each dam by using pipette smear technique 
The day of vaginal plug formation or sperms observed in vaginal smear  also known as successful mating  were considered as GD   Gestation day  
The mated females were housed individually in clear polycarbonate cages with stainless steel wire lids 
Mating process was carried out to result in   pregnant animals per group 
Successfully mated females were randomized into control and treatment groups 
All the rats were sacrificed on GD  
According to OECD guidelines  the test chemical should be administered daily from implantation to the day prior to scheduled caesarean section in order to assess toxicity 
Test chemicals were administered to pregnant animals and sacrificed as per the schedule  which was as close as possible to the normal day of delivery without risking loss of data resulting from early delivery i e GD  
The females were killed  before caesarean section  the uterine contents were examined  and the fetuses were evaluated for soft tissue and skeletal changes The pregnant rats were randomized to two intervention and one control groups 
SSD was given during pre implantation to implantation stage  GD  – 
Each group of rats was treated either with vehicle  G  VC  SSD   G    mg kg  or SSD   G    mg kg SSDs were given from GD  –

Cage side observations for clinical signs of toxicity in the animals were recorded once daily until the day before necropsy •Body weight  Body weight of all experimental animals were recorded once before mating  initial body weight  and then after confirmation of mating 
Body weights were recorded on days               and on terminal day before sacrifice 
These recorded body weights were used for calculating the dose volume to be administered •Food consumption  Food consumption was evaluated once after successful mating or on day   of gestation  the day of vaginal plug formation or sperms observed in vaginal smear  and on days             and one day prior to sacrifice 
Calculated amount of feed were placed in the trough of each cage and the quantity of feed remaining after approximately   h were weighed and recorded •Morbidity Mortality  All the animals were observed twice daily  once in the morning between   and   h and once in the evening between   and   h  for incidence of morbidity and or mortality •Maternal examination related parameters  At the end of the observation period  all the dams were sequentially euthanized  by CO  asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation  and subjected to gross necropsy 
After termination  dams were examined macroscopically for any structural abnormalities or pathological changes 
Blinding was done while evaluation of the dams during caesarean section and subsequent foetal analyses to minimize bias 
Pregnancy rate was calculated as the proportion of mated pairs that had produced at least one pregnancy within a fixed period where pregnancy was determined by the earliest available evidence that fertilization has occurred 
Gestation index was calculated to indicate number of females with live born as a proportion of number of females with evidence of pregnancy •Examination of uterine contents  Immediately after termination  the uteri were removed and the pregnancy status of the animals ascertained 
Gravid uteri including the cervix were weighed  and number of corpora lutea were determined 
The uterine contents were examined for numbers of embryonic or foetal deaths and live foetuses 
The degree of resorption was described in order to estimate the relative time of death of the conceptus 
Any increase in the number of resorption and or implantation loss is an indicator of litter size for the individual dam •Examination of foetuses  The sex and weight of each foetus were determined 
Approximately one half of each litter were prepared and examined for skeletal alterations from selected dams 
The remainder were prepared and examined for soft tissue alterations  using accepted or appropriate serial sectioning methods or careful gross dissection techniques 
Each foetus was examined for external alterations 
Foetuses were examined for skeletal alterations  using Alizarin Red S staining method 
The fetuses for skeletal staining were kept in pre labelled plastic containers containing   ethanol before staining 
After skinning  we processed the foetus for staining by immersing in   alcian blue   GX for three days  then performed rehydration through a gradient series of ethanol   ethanol   –  h twice    ethanol   –  h  ethanol   –  h  distilled water until the samples sank to the bottom of a conical tube 
Samples were further treated with   KOH for  –  days or until it became clear and again treated with   alizarin red for next  –  days until bones became purple 
Samples were rinsed   times in   KOH  for  –  h at each time point

An illuminated magnifier was used for visceral examination 
We placed the foetus in a supine position on a paraffin wax block tray covered with paraffin wax  secured the fetal limbs by paper pins to the paraffin wax block  made a ventral midline incision from the umbilicus  cutting caudally to the genital tubercle and cranially to the diaphragm 
Once incision was completed  we located the ventral attachment of the diaphragm and lifted the liver carefully to examine the diaphragm for abnormal opening 
After observation  the diaphragm was clipped 
We gave a longitudinal cut to open the rib cage slightly lateral to and on the right of the sternebrae and then extended the cut anteriorly to neck region 
The rib cage was opened gently and secured to the paraffin block petridish tray with pins Foetuses were examined for soft tissue alterations  e g 
variations and malformations or anomalies  using Wilson s Technique 
The fetal viscera were examined sequentially  beginning with thoracic organs and moving caudally 
We performed hearts cuts after completion of other observations 
We examined the bilobed thymus for size  shape  coloration and presence of haemorrhages and then removed it for observation of trachea and esophagus 
We observed the lungs for size  color and number of lobes  observed the trachea  esophagus for normal alignment and presence of fistula  opened the pericardial sac and cut off pericardium to expose the heart for observation 
We checked the size  shape  color of the heart and normal development of major blood vessels 
After observation of thoracic viscera  we observed the abdominal viscera and liver for size  shape  color  texture  and number of lobes 
External anatomy of heart was examined by making two incisions using micro dissecting scissors We examined the stomach  spleen  pancreas  small and large intestines for size  position or any other developmental anomalies 
The intestines were moved aside after observation for seeing the underlying structures 
Ureters were checked for normal size and location and for continuity from the renal hilus to the urinary bladder 
One kidney was cut transversely and another was longitudinally to examine renal papilla and renal pelvis 
To confirm the sex of the foetus  the gonads were inspected carefully 
We examined the reproductive organs for size  shape and location GraphPad Prism® statistical software version   was used to analyze the data and all the results were represented as mean   S E M 
Intergroup variance for most of the parameters was calculated by one way analysis of variance  ANOVA  followed by Tukey s test 
A value of p     was regarded statistically significant 
Linear regression was performed to examine the weight change of dams during pregnancy for each group comparing with the control after adjusting for the litter size 
The malformations were analysed by performing Chi square test for trend for two groups  SSD  G  G  G  G  and SSD  G  G  G  G The ARRIVE guidelines were followed to report the findings 
In phase   pre natal study  all the dams dosed with SSD  and SSD  had normal food intake and weight gain 
The average gain in weight from GD  to GD   was       gms for controls while it was       gms in SSD   and       gms in SSD 
 Webtable  
No test item related mortality or clinical sign of toxicity was encountered during the study 
All dams in treatment groups and control group survived to scheduled terminal sacrifice 
They showed normal behaviour until euthanized 
There were no differences in mean maternal body weights  body weight gains  pregnancy rate  gestational index  pre and post implantation loss  and resorptions 
No significant differences were observed in foetal sex ratio  foetal body weights 
However  one dam from SSD  had all male foetuses 
No abnormality was detected in skeletal and visceral examination In phase   controls and SSD  and SSD  treated dams exhibited a comparable food intake  Table  
 
However  a dose response relationship was observed with reduced weight gain with higher doses of SSDs 
 Table  
 
Two dams  one in G   SSD    mg kg  and the other in G   SSD    mg kg  categories showed decreased or consistent body weight GD  onwards 
On an average  the weight on GD   was       gms in controls while it was       with SSD    mg kg  and       gms with SSD    mg kg 
The adjusted analysis indicated that except in G  there was a significant reduction in weight gain in all the intervention groups as compared to the control group after controlling for litter size  Table  
 During follow up  one dam from SSD    mg kg  and one from SSD    mg kg  showed haematuria during gestational day  – 
However  no another clinical sign of toxicity was encountered during the study 
All the dams in treatment and control groups showed normal behaviour and survived to scheduled terminal sacrifice 
In phase   pregnancy rate and gestational index were found to be   at all dose levels with SSD  whereas  in SSD  it decreased to   in G   SSD    mg kg  and G   SSD    mg kg  groups 
One dam from G   SSD    mg kg  and another one from G   SSD    mg kg  group showed mating confirmation during vaginal smear examination and showed positive sign in initial days of pregnancy but during necropsy on expected day of delivery  GD   no foetus was found 
Body weights of dams increased in the initial stages that became constant at a later period 
To reconfirm it  non gravid uterus was stained in salewski strain and presence of conceptus was found 
This indicated the possibility of miscarriage Increased pre and post implantation losses as well as resorptions and reduced live foetuses were observed with both SSD  and SSD 
No significant differences were observed in foetal sex ratio  but decreased foetal body weights were noted in both sexes 
On an average one early resorption in a group was a normal observation 
More than one late resorption was observed in all treatment groups while there was none in the control group 
Total count of live foetuses count was significantly reduced with SSD  and SSD  treatment in a dose dependent manner 
Total number of live foetuses were reduced up to   in SSD  at   mg kg treatment group and   in SSD  at   mg kg treatment group Both SSD  and SSD s at different dose levels showed decreased fetal weight in dose dependent manner  although the difference was not significant 
Skeletal and soft tissue alterations were observed in both treatment groups 
In general  the embryo–foetal examination showed abnormalities  which could have caused some functional damage to these foetuses if allowed to grow in the normal course 
In visceral examinations  slight dilation of the renal pelvis  reduced papilla size  urinary bladder hypertrophy was observed in few foetuses from both SSD  and SSD  treatment groups 
Few incidences of foetal soft tissue abnormalities encountered in this study were normal variants 
Skeletal examination showed variations in the ossification patterns like incomplete or poorly ossified skulls  ossification of sternebra  cleavage ossification of thoracic centrum  asymmetric thoracic centrum  and supernumerary rib in many foetuses in SSD  and SSD  groups  Table  
 
A trend was noted with increased incidence of certain malformations with increasing dosages of SSDs that was statistically significant for most malformations with SSD The results of this developmental toxicity study suggest that administration of SSDs to pregnant rats had significant impact on intrauterine foetal growth  early and late resorption as well as developmental anomalies 
These formulations have teratogenic potential but does not affect sex ratio IPs contain phytoestrogens like diadzein and genistein  In vitro rat whole embryo culture assay  WEC  studies of genistein in rats have indicated fetotoxic and teratogenic potential at concentration of ≥  μg mL  However  in vivo  an oral  gavage  embryonic and fetal development pilot study could not demonstrate any teratogenic effect in the same study 
These findings are different from our study probably because we used SSDs containing natural herbal and non herbal ingredients unlike those studies where synthetic genistein was used 
In both the studies  decreased body weight was observed indicating slight maternal toxicity 
Food consumption was unaffected in our study which is contrary to what was reported 
In another study  pregnant rats exposed to oral isoflavones  diadzein and genistein in varying combinations  showed alterations in the number of live foetuses  lysed foetuses  number of resorption sites  and implantation sites while no clinical signs suggestive of maternal toxicity  seizures  tremors and salivation  that was observed similar to our study 
Maternal mass gain was significantly reduced in rats treated with   mg kg of isoflavones  Ratio of females to males in the litter of different groups was similar akin to our finding  These observations clearly nullify the claim that consumption of SDDs could alter the sex of the growing foetus 
An analysis done by the same authors earlier revealed that SSDs contain testosterone and steroids 
 
  The prenatal testosterone in pregnancy is known to affect sexual development adversely      The principles of reproductive biology state that the genetic sex of an individual is determined at the time of conception and can never be altered under any circumstances 
However  phenotypic sex of the growing foetus is likely to be influenced by the hormonal milieu of in utero environment 
Our analysis was confined to phenotypic sex only and hence it is difficult to state if any differences existed with reference to genetic and phenotypic sex 
This requires further inquiry Evidence on the effects of SSDs on humans should best be obtained from human beings 
The findings of the current study corroborate well with the evidence generated from observational studies in human beings      Presence of skeletal and visceral malformations could explain why stillbirths are likely to be more in women who consume SSDs 
The dosing of the test drugs was intended not only to examine the period of organogenesis solely but to assess effects from preimplantation  through the entire period of gestation to the day before caesarean section 
The results were based on observations of more than   female animals with implantation sites at necropsy that added to its strength 
Unnecessary handling of pregnant animals as well as any stressors from outside was avoided 
At least three dose levels and a concurrent vehicle control were used with dams randomly allocated to different treatment groups that support the validity of the results 
However  absence of   rats per group does not support it to be a fully OECD compliant study 
We did follow the principles of Good Laboratory Practices  GLP  but due to constraints of resources the study could not be conducted as a GLP compliant study  though this is optimal for academic interests There is a lack of systematic approach to assess the safety and effectiveness of herbal preparations 
Ingredients for herbal medicines are often drawn from different sources and are used in combination  which may exhibit variability in terms of species  growing conditions  and biologically active constituents 
To isolate each active ingredient from each herb and then to establish its toxicity is time consuming  resource intensive and not practical 
Moreover  drug approval process does not accommodate undifferentiated mixtures  Though important  it surpasses the herb herb interaction and the potentiating effect of one compound over another 
Therefore  in our study  we administered the herbal mixture to assess the effects 
Real time evaluations have yielded important observations for several herbal drugs especially related to pregnancy 
For instance  Wang et al 
  used mice model to evaluate the adverse pregnancy outcomes after maternal exposure to the herbal medicines  particularly during early pregnancy  The major events included maternal and perinatal mortality 
Maternal weight gain  embryo growth and post natal weight gain were significantly decreased 
Moreover  foetal resorption and skeletal malformations were increased  signifying potential toxicity of Chinese herbal medicines 
This is comparable to our findings To conclude  the results of this developmental toxicity study suggest that administration of SSD  and SSD  to pregnant rats exerted significant impact on intrauterine foetal growth and development without any effect on sex ratio when administered during the period of organogenesis

It is therefore natural to expect that the distribution of amino acids  across all protein sequences  would appear to be fixed  given no mutations over a specific period of time 
Of the   naturally occurring amino acids  each seems to appear randomly located at a particular position within the sequence of a protein 
However  when the sequences of a group of proteins are compared to one another  specific patterns begin to emerge 
These patterns are commonly referred to as motifs and frequently produce similar structural elements and in many cases  similar functions between the proteins that contain them 
In recent years  significant efforts have been made to reduce sequences into discrete motifs  so that each can be linked to some specific biological function based on particular rules      
Databases that consist of identifiable amino acid motifs  such as PROSITE  Pratt and EMOTIF  have been constructed to allow researchers an easy classification of unknown proteins into families based on their common motifs               
All of these methods share one property  they depend on specific alignment algorithms  such as the basic local alignment search tool  BLAST or PSI BLAST  to perform the sequence comparison between diverse families of proteins being analyzed      
These methods have already led to a number of key discoveries and offer the promise of determining biologically meaningful information about function from a protein s primary sequence It is generally accepted that a strong correlation exists between a protein s amino acid sequence and its resulting structure and function         
Techniques that can quickly determine significant similarities between protein sequences are valuable in predicting an unknown protein s function within the cell 
Here we describe a procedure that  by computing the frequency of key amino acid pairs  can quickly classify large groups of proteins into functional groups 
In order to uncover any relevant amino acid strings  we have utilized statistical methods applicable to datasets with large fluctuations in the search of human protein sequences within both the Swiss Prot and Complete Human Genebank databases The goal of this manuscript is to demonstrate how these two residue motifs can be used to develop rapid methods for searching protein or genomic databases in order to locate potentially interesting or aberrant protein sequences 
As an example  we describe the distribution of select amino acid pairs within the genome of the Coronavirus  Tor  which is responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome  SARS    
We have examined additional sets  but the limited format of this paper precludes a large presentation of potential applications The set of all   naturally occurring  amino acids are described by their standard single letter representations  and are taken as the complete set contained within all protein sequences as shown below Zq A R N D C Q E G H I L K M F P S T W Y V Residues that are arranged in a certain order can be referred to as vectors and are represented symbolically as b n b b bn bj Zq The coordinates of each vector represent the amino acid symbols contained within any given protein  where n is the total length of the vector 
The collection of all vectors b n  in the proteome can therefore be denoted simply by Zq n The underlying structure of a protein sequence  which is the order of the amino acids  has unique and identifiable characteristics 
As an analogy  in written English  the letter q is almost always followed by u 
Also  the frequency of the word  and  is much higher than that of the related three letter strings   nad   nda   dan  and  dna  which are simply permutations of the same set of individual letters to construct a word with a different meaning 
Utilizing similar characteristics  we can intuitively scan for unique sequence vectors contained within any given protein 
We expand on these characteristics  by utilizing the concepts of affinity and order stability in Section  Using the entire Swiss Prot database  release number   as the basis for our calculations  we have constructed a probability table for the occurrence of the   naturally occurring amino acids  see Table  
    
In addition to the Swiss Prot database  we have also included data from Complete Human Genebank  NCBI Build Number   March    as a source for all characterized and hypothetical human protein sequences We use the symbol Ω to denote the Swiss Prot database  and the letter M to denote the number of proteins in the database  
Hence we can state that Ω As s M  where As a a as Ns  is the sth protein  ai with i Zq is the ith amino acid in the sequence  and Ns is the length of the protein sequence As 
For any vector b n  if there is a sequence As in Ω such that b n  is a segment of As  then we can say b n  occurs in Ω 
We can then use NΩ b n  to denote the total number of outcomes that b n  has occurred in Ω  and let NΩ n  be the total number of all vectors occurring in Ω with length n  Therefore p b n NΩ b n NΩ n is the probability that the vector b n  occurs in Ω 
We then introduce k p q b n log p b n q b n where p b n  and q b n  are any two probability distributions on Zq n  and b n  belongs to Zq n 
The quantity k p q b n  in Eq 
  is defined for any two probability distributions p b n  and q b n  on Zq n  where the distribution q arises from independent letter  i e  amino acid  probabilities 
Then  k p q b n  can be viewed as a random variable about b n  and its probability distribution is defined as follows F p q x PI k p q b n ⩽x b n k p q b n ⩽xp b n The expectation value μ p q  and variance σ p q  of p b n  are expressed mathematically as μ p q b n Zq n p b n k p q b n 
 σ p q b n Zq n p b n k p q b n μ p q  Hence we see that μ p q  is simply the Kullback–Leibler entropy   
As a consequence  μ p q  is always non negative and μ p q  if and only if p b n q b n 
As a result  the amino acid sequence of b n  can be represented by k p q b n In Eq 
  the probability distributions p  q in the k p q b n  have several possible values 
For example  if we let p be the probability of b n  and only change the value of q in k p q b n  we obtain the following expression q b n j np bj p b p b p bn Based on Eqs 
  and   the value of k p q b n  gives us the affinity for all amino acids within vector b n 
Here two situations are identified as especially interesting i When k p q b n  implies that among the amino acids in vector b n  there is an increased affinity 
That is  the vector b n  occurs more frequently than expected 
 ii When k p q b n  implies that among the amino acids in vector b n  there is a decreased affinity 
That is  the vector b n  occurs less frequently than expected In a similar approach to the condition described above  we may choose q b n p πn b n  where πn b n  is a permutation of b n  and πn denotes a permutation transform 
In this case  the order sensitivity of b n  can also be reflected by the value of k p q b n  and produces the following outcomes i when k p q b n  implies that b n  occurs much more often than πn b n ii when k p q b n  implies that πn b n  occurs much more often than b n In addition to the concepts of affinity and order sensitivity  we can also design other analysis techniques by choosing alternate representations of q b n 
Quantifying the terms k p q b n  we can represent vector frequency numerically 
In cases where k p q b n μ p q ⩾ σ p q  the corresponding vector b n  is called  positive  while in those cases where the opposite takes place  k p q b n μ p q ⩽ σ p q  the vector b n  is called  negative 
By judiciously choosing a   equal to   we obtained   two residue  positive pairs  and   two residue negative pairs  see Table  
  out of a total of   possibilities of amino acid pairs Using any one of the positive motifs from Table   we can develop a test method to detect changes in their distribution through any protein database 
If b b b  is  positive  then p b b μ σp b p b  where p ⋅  is the probability of the amino acids or vectors ⋅ in the database 
Since NΩ μ M Nμ p bj NΩ bj μ MNμ we have NΩ b μ M Nμ μ MNμ μ σp b NΩ b or NΩ b μ M Nμ μ MNμ μ σp b NΩ b and since μ M Nμ is very close to μ MNμfor Swiss Prot database we have NΩ b μ σp b NΩ b and NΩ b μ σp b NΩ b As a consequence of Eq 
  the detection of a deleterious mutation based on the increased appearance of an arbitrary string of these residues becomes possible 
For example  according to Table   CC is an attractive motif with   then NΩ CC μ σp C μ M Nμ μ MNμNΩ C ≈ μ σp C NΩ C Let Ns CC  and Ns C  be the number of CC and the number of C in the sth protein 
Then we have NΩ CC NΩ C  because μ σ  and p C  since NΩ CC s MNs CC NΩ C s MNs C Based upon the result that the CC pair represents a rare event  proteins satisfying Ns CC Ns C  as defined in Eq 
  suddenly become interesting 
We can therefore consider the number Ns CC  as an index to develop detection methods to test for the presence of a CC containing protein within a database 
Using this same reasoning  one can also use any other one of the remaining motifs in Table   to develop detection methods for additional proteins In an identical fashion to the previous example using the positive two residue motifs in Table   we can also use any of the  negative  two residue motifs to develop search methods 
For example  the CM pair is a  negative  two residue  word  with  
That is  p CM μ σp C p M 
Using identical arguments to those described in Section   we obtain NΩ CM NΩ M  and NΩ CM NΩ C 
Since both Ns M  and Ns C  are small numbers for fixed proteins  the overall number of CM pairs in most proteins should be close to zero 
Therefore  we can also use any of the remaining seven  negative  motifs in Table   to develop additional detection methods In contrast to the CC motif  the total number of proteins in the Swiss Prot database having more than one CM pair is quite small 
For example  among the   proteins contained within this database  the number of proteins such that Ns CM ⩾  is   and the number of proteins satisfying the condition Ns CM ⩾  is only  
For human proteins in Swiss Prot  the total number of proteins containing CM pairs is   and there are only   proteins that satisfy Ns CM ⩾   Table  
However  we would expect to find about   proteins having CM pairs in the Swiss Prot database  based upon the amino acid frequencies given in Table   which is greater than the number observed Cysteine rich proteins and the presence of CC pairs in proteins are both concepts that have been studied previously      
If we combine these two concepts and describe them in mathematical terms  we observe that the rates q Ns C Ns and q Ns CC Ns C  describe these two conditions  where Ns  Ns C  and Ns CC  are the numbers of all amino acids  cysteine  and CC  respectively 
We can then derive proteinsNs C Ns p C σ Ns CC Ns C p ξτ C ξτ C σ where σ  and σ  are the standard deviations about Ns C Nss Mand Ns CC Ns C s M respectively We have found the following computational results based on Swiss Prot database σ ≈ σ ≈ andp ξτ C ξτ C ⩾ p C For   we have a much simpler method to determine that a protein sequence is both C  and CC rich if proteinsNs C Ns ∩proteinsNs CC Ns C So  a much simpler method to test whether a protein is a both C  and CC rich for   isNumber of CC  Number of C Number of C  Length of protein Using this principle  we found a total of eight proteins that are both C  and CC rich within the Swiss Prot database For   there is an easier method to determine whether a protein sequence is both C  and CC rich if proteinsNs C Ns ∩proteinsNs CC Ns C So  a much simpler method to test whether a protein is both C  and CC rich for   is based on the inequalitiesNumber of CC  Number of C Number of C  Length of protein Using this principle  we can get a total of   proteins that are both C  and CC rich within the entire Swiss Prot database For   there is also an easier method to determine if a protein sequence is both C  and CC rich sequence when proteinsNs C Ns ∩proteinsNs CC Ns C So  a much simpler method to test whether a protein is both C  and CC rich for   is based on the inequalitiesNumber of CC  Number of C Number of C Length of protein Using this principle  we have identified a total of   proteins that are both C  and CC rich within the Swiss Prot database 
From these results  it becomes clear that there are many C rich proteins and many CC rich proteins that are not mutually inclusive 
The sets of both C  and CC rich proteins are only subsets of the set containing all C rich proteins or that containing all CC rich proteins Because the Swiss Prot database is somewhat biased to those proteins that are of interest to researchers  we have decided to examine a database that was  in essence  complete 
For this  we chose the human subset sequences contained within the Complete Human Genebank database 
This was the most complete and readily available source of human genetic sequences and should therefore provide us with an accurate representation of both CC and CM pair distributions 
We observed that the total number of CC pairs within the human subset of sequences contained in Genebank  a total of   proteins  was  
These pairs were contained within a total of   proteins  Table   a number that is substantially larger than the   we obtained from Swiss Prot data  Table  
Since the total number of amino acids in The Complete Human Genebank is   we can easily get the expected number of CC in Complete Human Genebank is   which is much less than this actual value  
The same also holds true for the CM pair  where we would expect to see   CM pairs  but actually observe    Table  
 
This result is surprising but true and shows that there are fundamental difference between the Human and other species in terms of the frequency of CC and CM pairs To create a single CM pair  it is obvious that one needs only a single C  If a protein sequence also contains a CC pair  the total number of cysteines available to create a CM pair has been reduced by a factor of  
Using the cutoff value of four CC pairs as statistically significant  we determined the probability of finding a CM pair within proteins that already contained a CC pair  Table  
Even though both CC and CM can occur in the same protein  the total number of proteins in Genebank that contain both CC and CM pairs is   and these pairs almost always occur at different locations in the sequence 
However  in some rare cases the second C within the CC pair is shared with the first C within the CM pair  giving us a new triplet CCM If we filter the set of proteins described above for redundant entries  we obtain a set of   unique proteins that contain the CCM triplet in the human proteome 
Using the probability distributions obtained from Swiss Prot  we obtained the probability of CCM as  
Since the total of all protein lengths in the Swiss Prot database is   there should be a total of   CCM triplets 
This value is almost identical to the predicted number of CCM of  
This result suggests that the CCM triplet at least in Swiss Prot occurs randomly 
However  we can also analyze the CCM probability using a different approach  putting q CCM p CC p M  into Eq 
 
If CCM occurs randomly  then we have p CCM p C p C p M  and since p CC μ σp C p C  we will get k p q CCM log p CCM q CCM log p C p CC ⩽ μ σ Based on Eq 
  it is clear that the presence of a CC pair strongly excludes M  Therefore  the probability of the CCM triplet should occur less frequently than that of CC or M individually We have obtained the following statistical results with regard to the total number of CC and CM pairs contained in the Swiss Prot database i The total number of these proteins satisfying Ns CC ⩾  is   and   of these are found in humans 
 ii The total number of human proteins in Ω that satisfy Ns CC ⩾  is  
 iii The total number of the proteins in Ω that satisfy Ns CM ⩾  is     of these are found in humans 
 iv The total number of human proteins in Ω that satisfy Ns CM ⩾  is only  
The genome of the SARS associated Coronavirus contains a total of   open reading frames  which code for six characterized and five uncharacterized proteins   
After examining the complete proteome the SARS associated Coronavirus we observed a statistically significant increase in the occurrence of the CC and CM pairs in the SARS associated Coronavirus  genome Of the   putative proteins  four contain either CC or CM pairs 
Two large poly proteins  GI  and GI  contain   CC and   CM pairs  as well as   CC and   CM pairs  respectively 
The putative spike glycoprotein  GI    contains   CC and   CM  while the small envelope protein  GI    contains only   CC pair 
The remaining   proteins  of which two have been identified as a nucleocapsid and matrix protein  contain no CC or CM pairs 
When compared to the occurrence of CC and CM pairs within all human proteins found in the Swiss Prot database  it becomes clear that there is an increased occurrence of these pairs within the SARS associated Coronavirus proteome It is clear that the frequency of CC and CM pairs is significantly higher in the SARS genome than it is in the human genome 
It is our hope that these unique two residue motifs could be used as a means of identifying a virus such as SARS 
While currently impossible to determine  one can see a possible clinical use for determining the frequency of CC or CM pairs in an individual 
If a person has been infected by SARS  we would expect the numbers of CC and CM pairs to be much higher than in a healthy individual 
If we were then able to develop a clinically feasible technique that could identify the CC or CM pair content in total cellular protein  without damaging the cell  it could be possible to implement a detection method simply by counting the numbers of CC or CM pairs in all proteins examined 
If the presence of increased CC or CM pairs was indicative of infection by SARS we could develop new drugs to inhibit the translation of proteins that contain these pairs within infected cells 
As a very specific example  this could be accomplished through the use of specific tRNA mimics that could block translating ribosome when these pairs appear at the P and A site simultaneously      
While tRNA mimics could normally be seen as non specific protein synthesis inhibitors  the lower frequency of the CC or CM motifs in host proteins as compared to the relatively high occurrence in viral protein provide a starting point for the analysis of treatments using methods such as these In this paper we have performed a detailed search of the Swiss Prot and Complete Human Genebank database in relation to the frequencies of each of the   natural amino acids and motifs made up of two residues 
This has provided us with a new insight into the distribution of proteins within these databases and the information that may be contained within a protein s primary amino acid sequence 
Our focus in this quest has been to examine specific pairs or triplets of residues and use probability theory to assess whether or not particular strings of residues occur more frequently than their probability would indicate 
By analyzing affinity and anti affinity  we developed a procedure to search out all two  and three residue clusters within these databases 
Through this technique  we can rapidly classify large groups of proteins into families based on the occurrence of these motifs 
Combining this concept with a specific knowledge of protein function  we propose novel ideas aimed at developing fast detection methods for specific diseases based on the unusually high occurrence of some of these motifs when compared with the expected probabilities 
A timely example of the application of this method is given  namely the analysis of the SARS virus 
This method will hopefully lead to the discovery of new diagnostic techniques and possible treatment of diseases  by recognizing the location of target domains in the expressed sequence Cell type specific expression of the putative SARS CoV  receptor ACE  in human heartsThe coronavirus disease    COVID  caused by SARS CoV  infections imposes a major threat for the world s healthcare systems and is leading to thousands of deaths 
Angiotensin converting enzyme    ACE  has been identified as a potential receptor for SARS coronavirus  and is also considered the main receptor for SARS CoV  SARS CoV  binds to ACE  via its glycosylated outer membrane spike proteins 
ACE  is highly expressed in the lung and heart  and is known for its vital role in the cardiovascular system –  Although SARS CoV  mainly invades alveolar epithelial cells  it can also cause myocardial injury  as assessed by increased troponin T and NT proBNP levels accompanying increased cardiovascular symptoms in COVID infected patients  It is unclear whether elevated biomarkers of cardiac injury  or long term effects on the cardiovascular system  are directly caused by viral infection of cardiac tissue or are secondary to hypoxia and systemic inflammation 
However  patients with underlying cardiovascular disease represent a significant proportion of the patients who may suffer from a severe course after COVID  infection  This situation may be aggravated by findings showing that ACE inhibitors  which are often used to treat cardiovascular diseases  augment the expression of the SARS CoV  receptor ACE  in lung cells  This is probably mediated by an effect on angiotensin II  which is known to reduce ACE  expression  Thus  ACE inhibition decreases angiotensin II  leading to an indirect up regulation of ACE  The effect of angiotensin II receptor blockers  ARBs  which primarily target the angiotensin receptor   is unclear 
One may speculate that ARBs indirectly reduce ACE  levels by augmenting free angiotensin II levels  which in turn is expected to down regulate ACE  via activating the angiotensin receptor  
However  the effect of the two different treatments on the expression of ACE  in the heart requires further investigation Therefore  we used single nuclei RNA sequencing to determine the expression of ACE and ACE  in the different cell types of the human heart 
Gene expression signatures were detected in cardiac tissues of five patients with aortic stenosis  AS  and two patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction  HFrEF   Figure  A  and compared with with samples of one healthy donor heart  age    years  male  that was not used for transplantation 
After single nuclei RNA sequencing  data were pooled  and unsupervised clustering was performed with a total of     nuclei 
We found   distinct clusters 
Using cell type specific gene markers  major cell types were annotated  including cardiomyocytes  six clusters  fibroblasts  one cluster  endothelial cells  three clusters  leucocytes  two clusters  pericytes  one cluster  and smooth muscle cells  one cluster   Figure  B–D 
ACE  was expressed in cardiomyocytes  Cluster   and   and mural cells  particularly pericytes  Cluster   and was detected at a lower expression level in fibroblasts  endothelial cell  and leucocytes  Figure  D 
Comparison of ACE  in a pooled analysis of nuclei of the different groups showed that ACE  was significantly elevated in cardiomyocytes of patients with heart disease compared with healthy controls  Figure  E 
ACE  was also slightly  but not significantly  increased in endothelial cells  and the expression was lower in fibroblasts of patients with heart disease compared with healthy controls  Figure  E 
Immunostaining confirmed an increased expression of ACE  in cardiomyocytes of patients with aortic stenosis  Figure  F 
In addition  ACE was augmented in cardiomyocytes of patients with AS and HFrEF  Figure  G 
Interestingly  cardiomyocytes of patients who were treated with ACE inhibitors showed a significantly higher ACE  expression compared with ARB treated patients  Figure  H 
Moreover  patients treated with ACE inhibitors had an imbalance of ACE to ACE  expression  with a more than four fold higher ACE ACE  ratio compared with healthy control cells  Figure  I In conclusion  these data provide novel insights into the cell type specific expression and regulation of ACE  in the heart 
Patients with varying heart disease aetiology show augmented expression of ACE  levels particularly in cardiomyocytes 
Treatment with ACE inhibitors tends to be associated with increased ACE  mRNA and unfavourable ACE ACE  ratios  which are believed to be a driver of cardiovascular pathologies  This study is limited by its small sample size and therefore is only hypothesis generating 
However  these novel data suggest that it will be important to monitor SARS CoV infected patients for cardiovascular complications and assess the impact of ARB ACE inhibitor therapy 
Conflict of interest  none declared New onset acute symptomatic seizure and risk factors in coronavirus disease   A retrospective multicenter studyIn December   pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus  later called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus    SARS‐CoV‐  was first reported in Wuhan  China 
On March     the World Health Organization  WHO  declared the syndrome caused by SARS‐CoV‐  infection  coronavirus disease    COVID‐  a pandemic 
According to a WHO Situation Report of April    
 
 there are   confirmed COVID‐  cases and   deaths globally 
COVID‐  affects people of all ages 
 
  
 
 and in severe cases  it may cause dyspnea  hypoxia  acute respiratory distress syndrome  and septic shock 
 
  
 

The current situation has raised concerns regarding whether people with epilepsy have a higher risk to be infected with COVID‐  and whether people would develop acute seizures during the course of COVID‐ 
The objective of this study is to clarify the incidence and the risk of acute symptomatic seizures during acute COVID‐  infections This retrospective multicenter study was approved by the ethics committee of West China Hospital  Sichuan University  approval   
The study was conducted in   officially designed hospitals in Hubei province  the epicenter of the COVID‐  epidemic in China  Sichuan province  and Chongqing municipality 
These hospitals included the East Branch of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University  West China Ward  Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital  and hospitals in Sichuan province designated by the government to treat COVID‐   see the list of hospitals in Appendix S People with COVID‐  who were discharged from or died in the participating hospitals between January   and February     were consecutively enrolled 
All cases were diagnosed according to the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for COVID‐   trial version  
 
 All those enrolled tested positive through nucleic acid detection 
Disease severity was classified as mild  moderate  severe  or critical according to the national guidelines  see Box   for classification criteria 
 
 For our study  we aggregated severe and critical cases into a single severe group  whereas mild and moderate cases were aggregated into a single milder group 
The clinical outcome at discharge was either cured or death Electronic medical records of all enrolled cases were reviewed by   neurologists using a standard case report form  Appendix S 
Data were extracted on demographic characteristics  medical history  complications  treatments  and presence of risk factors for seizures 
These risk factors were considered to be the following  acute cerebrovascular disease  traumatic brain injury  TBI  central nervous system  CNS  infection  shock  hypoxia  severe metabolic disturbance  based on criteria from the International League Against Epilepsy
 
  multiple‐organ dysfunction syndrome  sepsis  and exposure to drugs or toxic substances Continuous variables were presented as median  interquartile range  and categorical variables as n  All of   people discharged from or who died at participating hospitals were consecutively identified and enrolled 
Most were from Sichuan province  n     followed by Chongqing  n     and Hubei  n    Ten individuals died  giving case fatality rates of    n     in Hubei     n     in Chongqing  and    n     in Sichuan 
Of the   severe cases      received mechanical ventilation  and     were given sedatives 
Apart from the effect of sedatives  mental state was relatively normal in   people 
Eight were encephalopathic  one was obtunded  one was delirious  and six were comatose 
The diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus was not made in any of these cases based on clinical presentation  results of investigations  or response to therapy 
No routine or long‐term electroencephalogram  EEG  was recorded due to exposure concerns None in this cohort had a past history of epilepsy 
None had any seizures  including febrile seizures  or status epilepticus during hospitalization 
Seizurelike events were seen in two people  it was believed that this was the result of an acute stress reaction in one and hypocalcemia in the other The first was a  ‐year‐old woman who reported bilateral bodily spasms lasting for about   minute  with mouth deviation but no impairment of awareness 
She was evaluated neurologically and psychiatrically and was diagnosed with an acute anxiety disorder  which was treated with olanzapine  paroxetine  and diazepam The second case was a  ‐year‐old woman who displayed bilateral myoclonus in the limbs with no impairment in consciousness   hours after admission 
Although this was initially suspected to represent seizures  she was found to have an electrolyte disturbance including hyponatremia  hypokalemia  and hypocalcemia  and the myoclonus resolved with correction of the metabolic disturbances Eighty‐four   cases reported systemic or direct brain insults that increased their risk for acute symptomatic seizures  Table  
The most common risk factor was hypoxia 
No severe electrolyte disturbance was seen  but hypokalemia  n       hyponatremia  n       and hypocalcemia  n       were frequently seen in the cohort 
Urea  creatinine  and serum glucose levels were moderately altered in most of cases 
In two cases who had chronic kidney dysfunction  substantial increases in creatinine levels were noted 
Results of investigations are shown in Table  
One case with TBI had an epidural hematoma  cerebral contusion  and skull base fracture 
Five people with severe COVID‐  experienced septic shock 
Three other cases of shock had hypovolemia or cardiac problems 
Ninety‐four   were given antibiotics  moxifloxacin  n       piperacillin sulbactam sodium  n       and third‐generation cephalosporins  n       were most commonly used We found no new onset seizures or status epilepticus in a large cohort of people hospitalized during the acute phase of COVID   infection despite a substantial proportion having risk factors for acute symptomatic seizures 
This is useful information  given the prior lack of knowledge about seizure risk during the acute phase of infection No individual in this cohort had a history of epilepsy prior to hospital admission 
To date  there is not much information available on people with epilepsy during the COVID‐  crisis 
There is one report of epilepsy in a case COVID‐  from Wuhan 
 
 As information is limited  it is not possible to establish whether this was a patient who had a history of epilepsy or whether the patient presented acute seizures 
There is at this time little if any evidence indicating that people with epilepsy are at an increased risk of COVID‐  infection 
A major challenge for people with epilepsy in this outbreak is nonadherence with the prescribed antiseizure medication  which was seen during the in SARS endemic in  
 
 This indicates the need to ensure the availability of supplies of medications and to advocate patients  self‐management 
Possible strategies for coping could also include online consultations and telemedicine networks Although many neurological and systemic disorders regarded as potential triggers
 
 of acute symptomatic seizures were identified in this cohort  seizures and status were not seen 
Stroke is one such risk factor 
The risk of developing acute symptomatic seizures after stroke ranges from   to  
 
 Acute cerebrovascular disease is considered a major cause of seizure and status epilepticus 
An earlier study from Hubei
 
  
 
 also reported six people with COVID‐  who had acute cerebrovascular disease without seizure 
Infection of the CNS can also give rise to seizures 
Although there is limited evidence of the presence of the SARS‐CoV‐  in the cerebrospinal fluid  CSF  the co‐occurrence of tubercular meningitis
 
 had been reported  with no seizure or status observed 
To determine whether COVID‐  can cause direct CNS insults requires further follow‐up 
In the earlier outbreaks of another coronavirus  a generalized convulsion with a positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for SARS‐CoV in CSF was reported  which could have been a coincidence 
 

Disturbances of homeostasis may lead to acute symptomatic seizures 
Hypoxia  the most common complication in our cohort  may trigger anoxic encephalopathy  particularly in refractory hypoxia 
Electrolyte disturbances as seen in COVID‐  are considered to be potential causes of acute symptomatic seizure 
 
 The severity and speed of such disturbances may affect onset of seizures  so these parameters should be carefully monitored The cytokine storm syndromes
 
 behind severe infection may cause the production of inflammatory cytokines systemically  with the consequence of acute toxic encephalopathies 
Although sepsis is a common cause of encephalopathy in intensive care medicine 
 
 hypoxia appears far more often than sepsis in COVID‐ 
There was also a high rate of septic shock in the COVID‐  population  varying from  
 
 to   in earlier studies in Hubei 
 
  
 

Certain antibiotics have been associated with symptomatic seizure 
 
 Antibiotics were used in a large number of people in our cohort without problems  but the most used antibiotics in the cohort were of low or moderate risk 
Clinicians should keep this seizure risk in mind when prescribing antibiotics  especially for people with renal dysfunction 
 

Our study has several limitations 
First  as a cross‐sectional study  we only have data from the acute phase of the disease 
A follow‐up study is underway to evaluate longitudinal seizure outcomes 
Second  the retrospective study design meant that we could not collect data on all relevant variables  for example  EEG was not recorded  so subclinical seizures could have been missed 
As all health care costs of COVID‐  treatment are covered by the government  all those suspected of infection are screened 
This may assure the objectivity and reliability of study materials  and it will allow for a future follow‐up study Our analysis suggests that COVID‐  poses minimal risk for seizures during the acute illness  although a significant proportion of severely ill individuals have risk factors that may increase the propensity to experience seizures 
These risk factors should be promptly addressed to minimize the risk of developing seizures 
Prospective long‐term studies must be done to determine whether people who have suffered from COVID‐  have an increased risk for developing seizures or epilepsy in subsequent months or years as a consequence of their illness None of the authors has any conflict of interest to disclose 
We confirm that we have read the Journal s position on issues involved in ethical publication and affirm that this report is consistent with those guidelines Decreased prealbumin level is associated with increased risk of mortality in hospitalized elderly patients with COVID The coronavirus disease    COVID  epidemic is caused by an infection with a novel coronavirus  officially named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus    SARS COV 
The infection spread rapidly on all continents and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization 
As of April       documented cases were reported worldwide  and   patients had died 
As there are currently no specific treatments and medications against the new virus  it is crucial to identify risk factors of severe prognosis Older patients have poorer prognostic factors and are more likely to experience critical disease 
 
 
Based on recent statistical data of China  among patients who were   years and older  the mortality rate was   which was significantly higher than that of younger patients at  
The proportion of deaths over   years old accounts for   of the total deaths in the national wide  which implicates aged people are more vulnerable to the SARS CoV 
Till present there are rare reports in literature focusing on the risk factors for poor outcomes of the elderly patients with COVID Serum prealbumin  known as transthyretin  its levels may be lowered not only by malnutrition  but also by inflammation and aging 
 
 
Compared to albumin  prealbumin has a shorter half life  a more rapid rate of hepatic synthesis  and predictable catabolic rate  hence  it may be a more sensitive indicator 
However  whether prealbumin could be an independent predictor of mortality in hospitalized COVID  elderly patients needs to be further elucidated The present study aims to describe the clinical characteristics and to investigate whether the prealbumin can serve as a valuable predictor of in hospital mortality  which might provide evidence for the risk stratification in elderly and help to improve the clinical practice and reduce fatality We designed this study as a retrospective cohort study design 
The elderly patients with COVID  who were admitted to Tongji Hospital in Wuhan from January   to February     were consecutively included 
This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Tongji Hospital  Approval Number  TJ IRB  and was complied with the Declaration of Helsinki 
The data were anonymous and the study was observational  so the informed consent was not gathered 
A flow diagram illustrating patient selection was described in Figure  
 
Inclusion criteria included elderly patients  ≥   years old  diagnosed with COVID  infection 
A total of   participants have been obtained 
Patients having missing baseline or outcome data  died on admission or being transferred to other designated hospitals during hospitalization were excluded 
There were   patients were included in the final analyses Data collection of participants was performed using hospital electronic medical record system 
Information included medical history  demographic data  physical examination  and hematological  biochemical  radiological and microbiological evaluation results were reviewed 
The data collection forms were reviewed independently by   researchers  CL and LYY 
Blood examinations were assessed at the central laboratory of Tongji Hospital following standard operative procedures 
The routine blood test was analyzed using Sysmex XE  hematology analyzer  Sysmex  Kobe  Japan 
The Cobas C   Roche  Mannheim  Germany  was used to measure the biochemical parameters 
Coagulation tests were detected by STA R MAX coagulation analyzer  Diagnostica Stago  Saint Denis  France 
Throat swab samples were collected and were tested for SARS CoV  with commercial real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  RT PCR  kit from DAAN GENE  Guangzhou  China 
The diagnostic criteria and all clinical procedures in this study followed  Diagnosis and Treatment of Pneumonia Caused by New Coronavirus  Trial version   to   promulgated by the National Health and Health Commission of China Summary statistics of baseline characteristics of all patients and stratification by prealbumin tertiles were expressed as frequency and proportion for categorical variables  mean   standard deviation  SD   Gaussian distribution  or median  range   Skewed distribution  for continuous variables  and as percentages for categorical variables 
The differences between groups were analyzed using the χ   categorical variables  One Way ANOVA test  normal distribution  or Kruskal Whallis H test  skewed distribution We examined the relationship of the prealbumin as categorized into tertiles with the outcomes of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation 
Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to evaluate these relationships  then unadjusted and adjusted odds ratio  ORs  and   confidence intervals  CIs  were calculated 
Model   is the minimally adjusted model with only sociodemographic variables adjusted 
Model   is the fully adjusted model with covariates including age  sex  smoking status  history of hypertension  history of coronary heart disease  history of diabetes  history of chronic kidney disease  history of carcinoma  history of chronic liver disease  neutrophil  lymphocyte  prothrombin time  activated partial thromboplastin time  d dimer  alanine transaminase  aspartate aminotransferase  total bilirubin  blood urea nitrogen  creatinine  C reactive protein and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio 
We calculated odds ratio  ORs  and   confidence intervals  CIs 
The highest tertile was the reference for prealbumin 
We performed test for linear trend by entering the median value of each category of prealbumin tertile as continuous variable to examine the possibility of nonlinearity To ensure the robustness of our results  we also performed stratified analyses with the prealbumin as a continuous variable for the overall population and stratified by gender  age  hypertension status and coronary heart disease status at baseline 
Generalized additive models were used to visually confirm the relationship between prealbumin as continuous variable and the risk of outcomes  all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation Modeling was performed with the statistical software packages R  http www R project org  The R Foundation  and EmpowerStats  http www empowerstats com  X Y Solutions  Inc  Boston  MA 
P values less than    two sided  were considered statistically significant In our study    cases were excluded 
To avoid selection bias due to missing data  we performed a sensitivity analysis 
The results showed that there was no statistical difference between missing group and non missing group  supplemental table  Of   elderly inpatients included in the final analysis  the mean age was     years  ranging from   years to   years  and most patients were male  table  
 
The baseline characteristics of these included participants were listed in table 
The day of sample drawing after admission was       day 
No significant statistical difference in sex  smoking status  body weight  BMI  comorbidity  hypertension  coronary heart disease  chronic kidney disease  cerebral vascular disease  carcinoma  chronic liver disease  symptoms  fever  cough  headache  diarrhea and myalgia fatigue at admission  were detected across different groups of prealbumin  tertile 
When compared with subjects in the highest tertile  those in the lowest tertile were older  more likely to have diabetes medical history  with higher Neutrophil count  lower lymphocyte count  worse coagulation function and liver function 
A total of     patients required mechanical ventilation      patients admitted to intensive care unit and     patients died during hospitalization 
The incidence of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation were significantly decreased across prealbumin tertiles  all cause death    vs    vs    for tertile   vs  tertile   vs  tertile   ICU admission    vs    vs    for tertile   vs  tertile   vs  tertile   mechanical ventilation    vs    vs    for tertile   vs  tertile   vs  tertile   respectively To investigate the correlation between prealbumin and in hospital outcomes  we constructed three models using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models  table  
 
In the unadjusted model  the ORs of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation was significantly increased as the prealbumin tertiles downgraded 
The OR for tertile   was significantly higher than the OR for tertile    OR       CI    to   P   for all cause death  OR       CI    to   P   for ICU admission  OR       CI    to   P   for mechanical ventilation 
Additional adjustment for the demographic variables and comorbidities did not reduce the ORs for the association between prealbumin tertiles and in hospital outcomes 
Further adjusting for the baseline levels of blood examinations  including blood routine  neutrophil  lymphocyte  neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio  coagulation function  prothrombin time  activated partial thromboplastin time  d dimer  liver fuction  alanine transaminase  aspartate aminotransferase  total bilirubin  renal function  blood urea nitrogen  creatinine  and infection indicators  C reactive protein  did not affect the relationships in the fully adjusted models  OR       CI    to   P   for all cause death  OR       CI    to   P   for ICU admission  OR       CI    to   P     for mechanical ventilation 
Therefore  lower tertile of prealbumin exhibited an increased risk of worse in hospital outcomes  full adjusted P for trend for all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation  P     P   and P     respectively Generalized additive models  Fig  
A through  C  were used to visually assess functional relationships between the prealbumin as continuous variate and the risk of in hospital outcomes 
Serum prealbumin was found to have negative linear relationship with the risk of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation To determine the consistency of the relationship between baseline prealbumin as a continuous variable and in hospital outcomes  we conducted stratified analyses  Table  
 
For each unit increase of prealbumin  the adjusted OR for all cause death was   in males  P     and   in females  P    
The adjusted OR for all cause death for persons less than   years of age was    P     compared with    p     for persons   years and older  P interaction    
For each unit increase of the prealbumin  the OR for all cause death was    P     and    P     for normotensives and hypertensives     P     and    P     for non diabetic and diabetes respectively 
The difference of interaction was not significant between two groups  P interaction         and   stratified for gender  age  hypertention and diabetes respectively 
Moreover  the relationship between baseline prealbumin with ICU admission and mechanical ventilation stratified by gender  age  hypertention and diabetes are consistent In this study  we found that lower serum prealbumin significantly associated with an increased risk of worse outcomes and all cause death during hospitalization 
Patients in the lowest tertile of prealbumin were older  and with higher Neutrophil count  lower lymphocyte count  worse coagulation function and liver function compared with subjects in the highest tertile 
Then we adjusted relevant covariates including age  sex  smoking status  comorbidities  neutrophil  lymphocyte  coagulation function  liver function  renal function and C reactive protein to minimize the potential impact of confounding 
Compared with crude regression analyses  this association still persisted when adjusting for demographic and clinical variables in the multivariable regression analyses 
Moreover  stratified by gender  age  hypertension and diabetes  increased level of serum prealbumin was associated with the decreased risk of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation  which determine the consistency of the relationship between lowest serum prealbumin tertile and the increased risk of worse outcomes in elderly COVID  patients Several previous studies have demonstrated baseline prealbumin change in COVID  patients 
Decreased level of prealbumin was observed among COVID  patients 
Wu C et al investigated   patients with COVID  and observed that prealbumin was associated with the development of ARDS  indicating the potential value of prealbumin level on COVID  clinical ending 
Till date  no report exists on the effect of prealbumin in COVID  elderly patients High proportion of severe to critical cases and high fatality rate were observed in the elderlyCOVID  patients  and rapid disease progress was noted in the dead 
One possible explanation involves the greater potential of seniors to be in a state of inflammation  nutritional deficiency and other complications 
Prealbumin is a globular  non glycosilated protein  synthesized by the liver  and complexed with a retinol binding protein  which acts as a transporter of retinol vitamin A and thyroid hormones 
Low plasma prealbumin level has far back emerged as an earliest laboratory indicator of poor nutritional status 
 
 
In addition  prealbumin are also associated with inflammation 
Previous studies showed that in response to the inflammation  the body responds by synthesizing a large number of cytokines 
These include interleukins and tumor necrosis factors that down regulate  decrease  plasma concentrations of albumin and prealbumin 
 
 
Therefore  assay of serum prealbumin concentration is recommended by some investigators as a screening marker for both malnutrition and inflammation Elderly with low plasma prealbumin levels mean that those people are at greater risk of malnutrition and inflammatory conditions  which may lead to poor prognosis 
Malnutrition is commonly seen in hospitalized patients in both the developed and developing world  especially among elderly patients 
A review of   published studies of acute care patients reported that malnutrition incidence ranged from  –  of hospitalized elderly 
It was found that compared to non famine regions of India  experiencing famine had significantly higher influenza mortality rates during the   Influenza pandemic 
Aging  frailty  and chronic diseases are associated with impaired immune function and are compounded by immune dysregulation from malnutrition 
When immune response is dysregulated  it would result in an excessive inflammation  even death 
In the current COVID  study  it was found that elderly patients have higher levels of white blood cells counts  CRP  inflammatory cytokines and are more likely to experience critical disease than did those younger patients 
 
 This retrospective cohort study included   elderly COVID  patients  until the date of February       of patients required mechanical ventilation    of patients admitted to intensive care unit  and the total in hospital mortality was  
The mortality rate was lower than that reported by wang L et al  among elderly COVID  patients 
This may have been the reason for some patients at the date of February     are still in hospital 
Nevertheless  this would not bias the relationship between prealbumin and in hospital outcomes because of the definite observation time we set previously 
Moreover  Wuhan tongji Hospital as one of the largest third grade Class A hospitals equipped with advanced life support training and equipment may partly account for the moderate mortality The results of this study have several clinical implications and strengths 
A low prealbumin concentration can therefore be regarded primarily as a signal identifying the at risk elderly patient who would suffer worse outcomes and requires careful assessment and monitoring for whom nutritional support and Inflammation detection may be needed as part of the treatment plan 
As observational study was susceptible to various confounders  we adjusted many variables that may affect the relationship between prealbumin and in hospital outcomes to minimize potential confounding 
In addition  we tested the robustness of the results by repeating the analyses in different subgroups of gender  age  history of hypertension and history of diabetes Our study has some limitations 
First  by including patients still in hospital as of J February     the case fatality ratio in our study cannot reflect the true mortality of elderly COVID 
Second  the record of data may be affected by prehospital medication and the time interval between admission and onset 
Third  since all subjects in our study were hospitalized Chinese elderly patients diagnosed with COVID  results of this study might not directly be applied to other ethnicities and age groups In conclusion  this retrospective cohort study revealed that the prealbumin is an independent risk factor for the in hospital mortality in the Chinese COVID  elderly patients 
Nutritional support and Inflammation detection should be careful assessment and monitoring for the elderly patients with low prealbumin concentration

Coping With COVID  Emergency Stress  Secondary Trauma and Self Efficacy in Healthcare and Emergency Workers in ItalyThe coronavirus disease  COVID  or the acute respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus    SARS CoV  began spreading in China at the end of   and  to date  represents an international health emergency without precedents in terms of its health  economic  and organizational effects on people s lives  World Health Organization   
After China  Italy was the first country to be affected by this epidemic  with the first deaths on February     and a rapid increase in the spread of infection and mortality 
COVID  was first detected in Northern Italy  and it then spread  although at different rates of incidence  to the other regions 
It was immediately evident that healthcare and emergency workers were at great risk of contagion and that protection and intervention protocols needed to be introduced in the absence of adequate points of reference because of the exceptional nature of the epidemic  the rate of spread of the infection  the seriousness of patients  health condition  and the mortality index 
The extreme conditions in which health workers have had to work  especially in the most affected regions in Northern Italy  are indicated by the following data from the Italian National Institute of Health   over   doctors died and   other health workers were infected within the general context of the population of   deaths and   infections in a span of   weeks 
It was also clear that the medical staff would experience serious psychological repercussions because of the working conditions as well as the difficulty of having scientific points of reference on care and intervention procedures 
To this must be added the increase in workload  the extension of working hours and  for health workers  the frequent exposure to the suffering and death of their patients 
Therefore  healthcare and emergency workers were subjected to serious psychological as well as physical stress 
Hence  the aim of this study  which was also the aim of a previous study  Vagni et al    is to focus on the similarities and the differences in the stress management of two professional groups healthcare and emergency workers during the acute phase of the pandemic 
Both groups have had to deal with COVID patients as frontline responders and have been exposed to the related risks of infection and psychological consequences  which  to date  have not been examined in detail through a comparative analysis As regards the stress that they experience  the literature clearly explains that healthcare and emergency workers who intervene in emergency situations are exposed to the risk of developing dysfunctional reactions that can be identified at different levels physical and or physiological  e g  psychosomatic disorders  sleep wake cycle alterations  and sense of tiredness  emotional  e g  irritability  nervousness  agitation  anger  low self esteem  and guilt  cognitive  e g  distractibility  sense of ineffectiveness  and negative anticipation of events  and relational  e g  increase in conflicts within emergency teams and or with their organization institution  and social withdrawal and may also develop reactions from secondary trauma  Del Missier et al    Sbattella    Argentero and Setti    Fraccaroli and Balducci    Bellelli and Di Schiena    Walton et al   
Faced with stressful events regarding which they lack previous experience and specific  necessary knowledge  and which cause tension owing to the need for rapid decision timings and a sense of responsibility  emergency workers may experience a sense of decision ineffectiveness 
In fact  emergency situations are characterized by high levels of decisional and operational uncertainty with associated regret and guilt  Del Missier et al   Several studies have highlighted that insufficient instructions and a lack of personal protective equipment  PPE  are important predictors of stress for healthcare and emergency workers in large scale emergencies  Oh et al    Du et al    El Hage et al    Walton et al   
Oh et al 
  highlighted that nurses involved in managing the Middle East respiratory syndrome  MERS  experienced lower levels of stress when the levels of goods supply and hospital training were higher 
Some studies have highlighted that frontline healthcare workers had lower secondary traumatization scores than non frontline health workers and the general public in contrast to the findings of previous research on the SARS outbreak in the same area in Singapore  Chan and Huak   
According to Barleycorn   and Tan et al 
  these results may be due to the dedicated training and psychological support given to healthcare workers after the SARS outbreak and demonstrate the validity of policy strategies for prevention of stress in the psychological health field An analysis of   studies published from January to March   aimed at investigating the stress experience of healthcare workers in facing COVID  shows that health workers experienced symptoms of depression and anxiety related to this stressful experience 
Moreover  the severity of their symptoms was influenced by their age  gender  role  specialization  type of activity performed  and exposure to patients with COVID  however  prevention  resilience  and social support interventions mediated their response to stress  Bohlken et al   
In a review of the literature  Spoorthy   underlined that sociodemographic variables  such as age  gender  profession  and workplace  and psychological variables  such as poor social support and self efficacy  affect the stress level experienced by health workers 
In addition  COVID  emerged as an independent stress risk factor 
Xiao et al 
  found that social support plays a role in reducing the anxiety levels in medical staff and increases their sense of self efficacy According to Walton et al 
  the specific stressors that health workers face in the COVID  emergency are related to the organizational context 
The challenges for medical staff include not only an increased workload but also a fear of infection  the need to work with new protocols that change frequently  and the use of PPE 
In uncontrollable situations such as a pandemic  when specific action protocols are absent and limited resources are available  health workers must make individual decisions with a heavy burden of responsibility that may be contrary to their moral principles 
For example  in the case of COVID  they may have to choose which patients to save because only a few places are available in intensive care 
In this regard  Cai et al 
  showed that for a sample of   healthcare professionals who worked closely with COVID  patients in Hubei  the most stressful factors were the lack of protocols for the treatment of COVID  the scarcity of PPE  the exhausting work shifts  their concern about the risk of infection  and their exposure to the death and suffering of their patients 
They also found that the support of superiors proved to be one of the most important motivational factors for medical staff  and the presence of clear guidelines and effective safety protocols were protective factors against the development of stress  in particular  for females 
Further  Walton et al 
  identified the organizational stressors as the changes in work shifts  the prevalence of night shifts  an excessive workload  staff roles  autonomy  the lack of support from superiors  and the absence of adequate information and clear instructions 
On the basis of these stressors  they estimated that   of the medical staff working on the front line of this pandemic are at risk of developing post traumatic stress disorder  PTSD 
In addition  limited resources  longer shifts  decreased hours of rest  and the occupational risks associated with COVID  exposure have increased the physical and mental fatigue  stress  anxiety  and burnout of these staff members  Sasangohar et al   The loss of a social support network  which can be an important resilience factor  is another risk factor  Ozbay et al   
In the COVID  emergency  healthcare and emergency workers have often experienced a separation from their affective links  either because of the restrictions on social contacts imposed by the lockdown or the fear of spreading the infection to their family members 
To this must be added that although  at first  health workers received unanimous encouragement from the population  later  they also experienced demonstrations of stigma and isolation 
Some studies have shown that being able to resort to their own social support network is a significant protective factor for health workers dealing with this emergency  Cai et al   As Favretto   stated  when individuals experience situations that go beyond their coping strategies  their vulnerability to  and risk of developing  psychopathological reactions increases 
Studies conducted during previous epidemics  such as the SARS  MERS  and Ebola epidemics  converge in detecting how healthcare and emergency workers may experience extremely high levels of stress and even develop secondary traumatic stress or vicarious trauma 
This trauma is defined as an experience of symptoms similar to those found in people with PTSD  such as in emergency nurses working with traumatized patients  Beck   
Figley   defined it as a form of stress that derives from the feelings of empathy experienced when helping traumatized people 
The symptoms may include intrusive recurring thoughts  disturbed sleep  fatigue  physical symptoms  hyperarousal  increased stress response  anxiety  depression  and feeling emotional  Adriaenssens et al   
Wolf et al 
  described how nurses may feel  overwhelmed  and this condition becomes a source of moral distress that triggers feelings of powerlessness  guilt  fear  anger  and frustration The sense of frustration and impotence felt by nurses when they are unable to treat and save a patient has been highlighted as a risk factor for secondary traumatic stress in several studies  Missouridou   
Avoidance and emotional numbing can become tools for self protection from intrusive symptoms that exceed the personal tolerance level  Coetzee and Klopper    Mealer and Jones   
Their frustration obviously intensifies on a patient s death 
The onset of PTSD in the health workers involved in treating MERS was also detected after the acute phase of the emergency was over  highlighting a risk not only in the immediate period but also in the medium term period  Lee et al   In reference to COVID  updated studies conducted on Chinese health workers have already highlighted the strong impact of the epidemic on the psychological health of doctors and nurses 
Some studies have found that healthcare workers have high levels of anxiety  depression  insomnia  and distress  Lai et al    Li et al    Zhu et al   
In particular  female professionals with more than   years of experience and previous psychiatric pathology present more risk factors of developing the symptoms of stress  anxiety  and depression  Lai et al    Zhu et al   
Huang J 
Z  et al 
  studied stress levels during the COVID  emergency in a sample of medical staff 
They found that females showed higher levels of anxiety and PTSD than males did and that the levels were higher for nurses than for doctors 
Moreover  Li et al 
  found that nurses had developed higher levels of vicarious trauma than those of the general population and that nurses who did not work closely with COVID  patients showed a more severe symptomatology  both physical and psychological  compared with their colleagues working on the frontline emergency services 
In Italy  a study conducted on healthcare workers found that doctors and nurses developed high levels of stress and anxiety  greater than those developed by the general population  and that healthcare workers operating in the North  the area of Italy most affected by the virus  showed a more severe symptomatology  Simione and Gnagnarella   
This study also confirmed that females tend to have a greater perception of the risk of infection  which increases their risk of developing the symptoms of anxiety and distress Because of their long  intense exposure to various stressors  it is important to note the nature of the coping strategies used by these healthcare and emergency workers in these situations and their effectiveness in terms of reducing and effectively coping with stress 
Indeed  the effective management of stress levels in the acute emergency phase could reduce the risk of developing long term PTSD or other pathologies  such as anxiety and depression  Fullerton et al    Slottje et al    Argentero and Setti    Sakuma et al    Birinci and Erden    Li et al   
Coping may be defined as a series of cognitive and behavioral efforts to manage specific internal or external issues that test or exceed individual resources  Lazarus and Folkman   
A distinction can be made between problem focused and emotion focused coping strategies 
The former is aimed at modifying and solving the stressful situation through active interventions 
By contrast  emotion focused coping is aimed at managing the emotions connected to the stressful event and regulating affective reactions  such as anxiety and the tension of response to stress  for example  by trying to avoid the threat  denial  or re evaluating it  reappraisal The choice of coping strategies is influenced by the individual s cognitive evaluation of the event  termed secondary evaluation  which involves estimating the resources available and the most effective strategies to deal with the situation  Lazarus and Folkman   
A key element of this assessment is the extent to which the individual can maintain control over the outcome of the situation 
The literature indicates that individuals apply dysfunctional coping when they face an uncontrollable event by responding primarily with a coping strategy focused on the problem  and conversely  when they face a controllable situation  they respond with coping strategies focused on emotions  Strentz and Auerbach    Vitaliano et al   
A coping strategy may be defined as adaptive when the controllability of the stressful event corresponds with the choice of coping strategy  in this case  the subject will experience fewer symptoms related to stress  Park et al   The strategies used to cope with trauma may differ among individuals  but they can also vary according to the profession and the features of the traumatic event  Nydegger et al   
Individuals differ in their choice of coping strategies  Connor Smith and Flachsbart    and factors related to the situation can also have a decisive influence on such choice  Brown et al   
A few studies have considered the ways in which gender influences the perception of stress in emergency situations and the choice of coping strategy 
These studies highlight that females tend to perceive events as more negative and uncontrollable and to resort more to coping strategies focused on emotions and avoidance  whereas males tend to resort more to applying problem focused coping and to inhibiting emotions  Matud    Matud et al    Matud and Garcia   The literature on the relationship between coping strategies and the stress levels of emergency workers has shown that the use of coping strategies focused on the problem usually tends to correlate with lower stress levels  both in healthcare workers  Watson et al    Howlett et al    and in other emergency workers  such as firefighters  Brown et al   
However  a coping strategy frequently used by emergency workers is that of avoidance and minimization  and this strategy is associated with higher levels of stress  Brown et al    Chang et al    Kerai et al    Witt et al    Theleritis et al   
Loo et al 
  found that in a group of emergency workers  avoidance as well as coping strategies focused on emotions were associated with the development of post traumatic symptomatology 
Rodríguez Rey et al 
  revealed that among health workers working in a pediatric emergency department  approximately   of the variance in PTSD was explained by the frequent use of coping strategies focused on emotions and the infrequent use of those focused on the problem 
In addition  Kucmin et al 
  who considered a sample of   paramedics  highlighted that the risk of developing PTSD symptoms was predicted by the use of coping strategies focused on emotions However  the literature does not offer unanimous results 
Chamberlin and Green   found that in a group of firefighters  all coping strategies actually correlated with high levels of stress  the authors explained this finding by suggesting that it is not the individual coping strategies that are maladaptive in themselves  but that greater effort is needed to adjust in stressful situations 
By contrast  Young et al 
  indicated that firefighters use problem focused coping strategies more often at the beginning of the operation and emotion focused coping strategies more commonly in the phase of breakdown and fatigue 
However  after the incident  they use both strategies  Young et al   
A meta analysis by Shin et al 
  highlighted that different coping strategies have different effects on work burnout  in particular  emotional stress and depersonalization are associated with the use of emotion focused coping strategies  whereas professional ineffectiveness is associated with the use of problem focused strategies Further  a few studies have investigated the coping strategies that emergency workers can use during health emergencies similar to COVID 
Maunder et al 
  revealed that healthcare professionals who tended to apply dysfunctional coping strategies  based on avoidance  hostile comparison  or self blame  tended to develop higher stress levels 
Wong et al 
  highlighted that during the SARS epidemic  doctors and nurses tended to use different coping strategies 
The doctors tended to turn more to action planning  but this strategy did not affect their stress level 
Instead  their stress level was positively correlated with their use of coping strategies based on emotional outlets 
By contrast  the nursing staff tended to resort more to behavioral disengagement and distraction strategies  which  however  correlated with higher levels of stress among them In this regard  during the MERS epidemic  hospital staff tended to adopt coping strategies related to the use of PPE and the adoption of all prevention measures  as well as social support  whereas the coping strategy that they adopted the least was that based on an emotional outlet  Khalid et al   
A recent study on healthcare workers in Hubei  China  during the COVID  epidemic  Cai et al    yielded similar results  to reduce stress  the medical staff tended to rely on active coping strategies  such as using security protocols  practicing social isolation measures  and seeking support from family and friends  but they did not find it necessary to discuss their emotions with a professional 
Huang L  et al 
  found that a sample of nurses working during the COVID  emergency presented greater emotional reactions and turned more to problem focused coping compared with university nursing students 
Emergency workers must have sufficient self efficacy in terms of their coping skills to be able to manage and cope with stress levels 
Self efficacy in coping appears to be an effective protective factor in relation to stress levels and maladaptive responses  Chesney et al   
Self efficacy to cope with traumatic events has been effective in reducing the risk of developing PTSD  Bosmans et al   The main objective of this study is to identify the coping strategies activated by healthcare and emergency workers to deal with stress factors related to the COVID  emergency that may be associated with the risk of developing vicarious or secondary trauma 
Few studies have considered both groups simultaneously when analyzing the strategies they have adopted to manage stress during the COVID  emergency 
Hence  in this study  we are interested in detecting the similarities and differences in the approaches they adopted to manage their stress during the acute phase of the current pandemic According to Walton et al 
  the main acute stress reactions of emergency workers to emergency medical situations are emotional  cognitive  physical  and social reactions 
Therefore  these factors were included in the questionnaire used in the present study 
Moreover  reactions linked to stress factors for difficulties due to ineffective decision making and dealing with stress were also considered  Chesney et al   
In addition  fears regarding contracting the virus and infecting their own families because of COVID  were specifically considered  Du et al    Huang J 
Z  et al    Ornell et al    Walton et al   Based on results found in the literature  the specific objectives of this study are as follows Participants were selected on a voluntary basis through a trasversal sampling in order to take a picture of the situation caused by the pandemic emergency 
We used an internet platform to conduct the study and approached the participants using social media  dedicated mailing lists  and forums 
Participants from all Italian regions completed the questionnaire online 
The sample consists of   participants  males   and   females  whose average age was   years  SD     min   – max  
Further    of the sample were married    were separated  and the remaining   were single 
We selected various professional figures who had directly worked in various sectors during the COVID  emergency and who could be divided into two main groups 
The first  the  Health Group  consists of   participants   who were healthcare workers    doctors     nurses     psychologists   and seven healthcare assistants  
Their average age was   years  SD     and their average years of active professional service was    SD    
The second  the  Emergency Group  consists of   participants     emergency workers     firefighters   and   Civil Protection staff   whose average age was   years  SD     and average years of service was    SD    
There was an age difference between the two groups  t     p   and the distribution of the gender variable differed between the two groups  with   males and   females in the Health Group and   males and   females in the Emergency Group  χ    p    
The study involved participants from the entire national territory  and their workplace could be divided as follows      and   were from North  Central  and South Italy  respectively 
Further    of the sample worked directly with COVID  patients and   worked in specific COVID  departments 
Among the healthcare workers    had worked in direct contact with COVID  patients  whereas among the emergency workers  only   had assisted these patients  χ    p    
In the present study  we included two variables  lack of necessary instructions and lack of PPE  in accordance with the findings in the literature on their impact on the stress reactions of healthcare and emergency workers during the COVID  pandemic 
Among the participants    and   of healthcare and emergency workers  respectively  did not have sufficient instructions to intervene  χ    p n s 
  and   and   of healthcare and emergency workers  respectively  lacked adequate PPE when working  χ    p n s 
 This study used an online questionnaire and was conducted during the lockdown period owing to the COVID  pandemic 
The questionnaire had three parts  one each to collect online informed consent and baseline sociodemographic information  and one with an online series of questionnaires  as described in the next section 
Participants  anonymity was maintained in collecting the data 
The institutional Ethics Committee approved all the procedures This instrument s   items enable verification of the presence of two symptoms of vicarious trauma  Intrusion and Arousal  and their relative frequency 
The STSS was built on the basis of the conceptualization expressed in the DSM   American Psychiatric Association    regarding the characteristic PTSD symptoms 
In detail  the Arousal items describe situations characterized by anxiety  confusion  physical and psychological complaints  and agitation 
Intrusion refers to the re experiencing of the traumatic event even if not directly suffered through internal images and memories 
Instructions for the STSS I indicated that respondents should specify how frequently an item was true for them in the previous   weeks 
The statements are evaluated on a  point scale     never      very often  that provides scores for Intrusion  example items   I thought about my work with victims when I didn t intend to   Reminders of my work with clients upset me  and Arousal  example items   I had trouble concentrating   I was easily annoyed   I expected something bad to happen   I felt jumpy 
The reliability coefficients of the instrument are   and   for Arousal and Intrusion  respectively This is a  item measure of perceived self efficacy for coping with challenges and threats 
This measure focuses on the changes in individuals  confidence in their ability to cope effectively  based on the self efficacy theory  Bandura    Chesney et al   
Participants were asked   When things aren t going well for you  or when you re having problems  how confident or certain are you that you can do the following  Then  they were asked to rate on an  point scale the extent to which they believed they could perform important behaviors for adaptive coping 
The instrument yields three subscale scores   problem focused coping   α      stop unpleasant emotions and thoughts   α     and  support   α    
Anchor points on the scale are    cannot do at all     moderately certain can do  and    certain can do We constructed an ad hoc  item questionnaire that included Yes No questions to detect stress factors identified by the literature  such as the availability of suitable equipment and the receipt of clear instructions during the COVID  coping experience 
In this study  we present the results related to two of these items   Instructions  which refers to having received the necessary instructions to intervene  and  Equipment  which refers to having PPE 
Predictions of these factors have also been made in other studies  Du et al    Walton et al   
In light of the relevance and specificity of the lack of clear information or instructions and adequate PPE in the management of COVID  in the Italian context  as well as the findings in other studies  we decided to focus attention on these two risk factors Our analysis of the literature revealed that in situations in which they have to cope with a pandemic  several factors may affect the stress of medical staff and emergency healthcare workers and that COVID  represents an independent specific stressor  Spoorthy   
These stress factors have been identified as frequently affecting healthcare and emergency workers in emergency situations and leading to physical  emotional  cognitive  decision making  relational  and organizational stress  Del Missier et al    Sbattella    Argentero and Setti    Fraccaroli and Balducci    Bellelli and Di Schiena    Du et al    Walton et al   
Focusing on the specificity of the COVID  epidemic  items have been constructed regarding the fears of contracting the infection and of infecting colleagues or family members  Walton et al    since COVID  represents a factor of independent stress  Spoorthy    that has great impact  Huang J 
Z  et al   
Consequently  we constructed the ESQ consisting of   items assessed on a  point Likert scale  with scores ranging from    not at all  to    very much  grouped into six scales 
The participants were asked to indicate how often they experienced certain emotions and thoughts while performing intervention and emergency activities during the COVID  pandemic The scales correspond to the factors identified and confirmed by factorial analysis through an analysis of the main components with orthogonal rotation of factors  varimax 
The number of factors to be extracted was initially verified through the unit s largest eigenvalue criterion and  subsequently  by the scree test 
The ESQ is based on six scales The ESQ demonstrated good internal consistency  α     overall and for each individual scale  Organizational–Relational Stress  α     Physical Stress  α     Inefficacy Decisional Stress  α     Emotional Stress  α     Cognitive stress  α     and COVID  Stress  α    First  we performed Pearson s correlation analyses to identify the associations between the variables for the two groups that we considered in this study 
Subsequently  we checked for significant differences between the two groups as their stress levels  coping strategies  and secondary trauma 
We used hierarchical linear regression models to verify the predictive effect of the risk factors  lack of adequate information and PPE  on the different stress levels  in step  
Then  we verified the protective effect of the coping strategies  in step  
The models were controlled for age  gender  and group 
Lastly  we used hierarchical regression models to verify the predictive effect of stress factors on the components of secondary trauma 
The models were controlled for age  gender  and group First  we conducted correlational analyses and comparisons of averages on the reference sample 
Table   shows the correlations between the scales of the ESQ and the other instruments Preliminary comparisons were made through the Student s t test between the Health Group and the Emergency Group in relation to the ESQ  CSES SF  and STSS I scores 
Table   shows the comparison between the two groups As shown in Table   significant differences emerged between the two groups in relation to their Stress and Arousal levels 
The results indicate higher levels of both for the Health Group  and that emergency workers turn more to the Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts strategy 
Further  we performed comparisons with reference to the gender variable to detect differences in the levels of stress factors  coping strategies  and secondary trauma 
Females reported significantly higher Physical Stress than males did  Females  M     SD     Males  M     SD     t     p     as well as Emotional Stress  Females  M     SD     Males  M     SD     t     p     and COVID  Stress  Females  M     SD     Males  M     SD     t     p    
No gender difference emerged in coping strategies and secondary trauma 
Within the Health Group  there were significant differences regarding Inefficacy Decisional Stress  F     p     Doctor M     SD     Psychologist M     SD     average difference     p     and COVID  Stress  F     p     Nurse M     SD     Doctor M     SD     difference     p    
Within the Emergency Group  there were no differences in levels of stress and secondary trauma or coping strategies 
Moreover  we found similar correlations between the two groups for the Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts strategy and the stress factors  whereas for the other two coping strategies  we found a different association  particularly for the Emergency Group 
However  the t test comparisons highlight differences only at the level of the Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts strategy 
Given the findings of the preliminary analyses  we considered it necessary to include the age  gender  and group variables to test the predictiveness of the coping strategies on the participants  stress levels To test the predictive effect of the coping strategies on various levels of stress  hierarchical regression was conducted 
Considering the Age and Gender differences within the groups  we included these variables in all models together with the Group variable  Health vs 
Emergency  and the  Instructions  and  Equipment  variables 
The models generated by assuming the ESQ scales as dependent variables are shown in Table  
Regarding the coping strategies  we observed an important effect of the Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts Coping strategy on all the stress scales  except for Physical Stress where the effect of the Focused Problem Coping strategy is recorded As shown in Table   significant negative associations between stressors and secondary trauma were found for both groups 
The hierarchical regression models of stress scales were analyzed for the Arousal and Intrusion levels of secondary trauma 
The models included the Age  Gender  Health Emergency Group variables  and the ESQ scales 
The results are shown in Table  The same regression models were generated by including coping strategies as predictors and were analyzed by Age  Gender  and Health Emergency Group 
Compared with Arousal  the Health Emergency Group and Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts are predictive  R    F     p     Beta  ∗∗∗  Beta  ∗  respectively 
Compared with Intrusion  only the Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts variable  R    F     p     Beta  ∗  assumes significance This study has several limitations 
The first is the limited sample size 
The second is that our study involved participants in the very midst of the COVID  emergency  which means that the level of stress in healthcare workers may have been more severe and acute 
Moreover  the long term psychological implications for the healthcare and emergency population should be investigated for the presence of a full secondary trauma 
Therefore  a large sized longitudinal study is called for to further explore the pathogenesis of vicarious traumatization 
The third is that participants were not selected based on whether they had existing psychological problems 
In proposing the hypothesis of this study  we anticipated that we would be able to discover the relationships between coping strategies  emergency related stress  and secondary trauma in healthcare and emergency workers and commenced our investigation by assuming that the impact of stress can provoke psychological consequences in emergency situations 
In future work  this assumption could be tested to verify whether an emergency situation has a different impact on workers who have already experienced psychological problems The raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors  without undue reservation  to any qualified researcher The studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by Comitato Etico per la Sperimentazione Umana – CESU of the University of Urbino

As reported by some  the association of acute kidney injury  AKI  and COVID  has a high mortality   
However  the incidence of reported AKI associated with COVID  varies widely             
It would be expected that kidney involvement is frequent since the virus enters the cell through the angiotensin converting enzyme    ACE  which is expressed  in addition to pulmonary type   alveolar cells  on renal proximal tubular cells  glomerular visceral and parietal epithelium  and the cytoplasm of the distal tubules and collecting ducts         
In addition  COVID  induces hemodynamic instability and severe inflammation  which  in addition to direct renal infection  can induce acute tubular necrosis  ATN 
We report our experience with AKI in COVID  patients in an inner city  predominantly minority  and a low socioeconomic group and compare our experience with other studies in significantly different cohorts of patients 
We identify the incidence  risk factors  and prognosis of AKI and thus provide a broader understanding of this complication in a group of patients not specifically reported upon to date All adult patients   years of age admitted to the Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center with COVID  infection from March   through April     were studied in this retrospective analysis done in a single medical center serving a low income minority population in Brooklyn  NY 
It was one of the single centers with the most admissions of COVID  patients 
COVID  infection was diagnosed based on clinical presentation  radiographic lung abnormalities  and a positive result of real time PCR 
We excluded COVID  patients from our study if they were on maintenance hemodialysis or were renal transplant recipients 
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Brookdale Hospital and did not require patient consent because of its retrospective design We collected the demographics  the presenting clinical symptoms when available  prior medical history including outpatient medications and prior level of renal function  comorbidities  and in hospital laboratory data from the electronic medical record  Epic Hyperspace   
Laboratory data consisted of complete blood count  hemostasis parameters  renal and liver function  PF ratio  arterial oxygen partial pressure  PaO  fractional inspired oxygen  FiO   creatinine kinase  lactate dehydrogenase  and inflammatory markers including high sensitivity C reactive protein  hs CRP  ferritin  and D dimer 
Normal range of these measures was provided by our laboratory The Kidney Disease  Improving Global Outcome  KDIGO    definition was used to identify AKI 
Estimated glomerular filtration rate  eGFR  on admission was taken as baseline eGFR and was divided into   and ≥  mL min  m 
eGFR was estimated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study  MDRD  equation 
The earliest day of the serum creatinine change that met the KDIGO criteria for AKI was selected as day   of AKI 
The peak serum creatinine value was used to determine the stage of AKI  with an increase in the serum creatinine of  –   –  and   times the baseline serum creatinine defined as AKI stages     and   respectively Continuous variables were described as mean   standard deviation for normally distributed data  or median and interquartile range  IQR  values for non normal distribution 
Categorical variables were presented as frequency and percentage 
The mean of continuous variables was compared by using independent t tests  the Wilcoxon rank sum test  and the Kruskal Wallis test  across the stages of AKI 
The proportion of categorical variables was compared by using χ  test 
Fischer s exact test was used when there were only limited data available 
The Kaplan Meier method  log rank test  was used to determine the cumulative incidence of in hospital mortality 
We used the Cox proportional hazard  PH  regression to determine the association of kidney disease indicators and in hospital mortality 
The assumptions of the Cox PH model were checked using the Schoenfeld residuals  and no violations of the assumptions were present 
In the multivariable analysis  separate Cox PH models were used to determine the association of baseline eGFR and blood urea nitrogen  BUN  on admission  proteinuria  hematuria  and stages of AKI with in hospital mortality since these variables showed a highly significant correlation 
Variables for Cox PH regression were selected using stepwise regression 
Variables with α level of risk factor   were entered into the model 
While evaluating the association of hematuria and proteinuria with in hospital mortality by the Cox PH model  patients with missing values  n     were excluded from the analysis 
All statistical analyses were performed using the STATA version   software and a p value of   was used to determine statistical significance In this study    adult confirmed cases of COVID  were initially reviewed 
Patients on maintenance hemodialysis  n     were excluded from the study and   patients were used for the analysis 
Baseline characteristics of these patients are shown in Table

The median age of the patients was   years  IQR  –  and   of them were male 
Most of these patients presented with dyspnea   cough   and fever  
  of the patients had a systolic blood pressure below   mm Hg at presentation 
   n     of all patients were mechanically ventilated during the hospitalization 
The median values of ferritin  D dimer  hs CRP  creatinine kinase and lactose dehydrogenase were elevated above their reference ranges  see online suppl

The development of AKI was seen earlier in the course in patients with an eGFR   mL min  m  at presentation   vs    and occurred within   h of admission 
Patients who developed AKI during the hospitalization were more likely to have a systolic blood pressure of   mm Hg at presentation and a lesser PF ratio and were more likely to be intubated during the course of hospitalization  Table

The modalities of RRT were continuous RRT in   patients   of all those who required RRT  and intermittent hemodialysis in   patients  
Two patients   required both modalities of RRT

In our cohort of   COVID  patients  a relatively higher percentage of patients     of   developed in hospital AKI 
Current evidence suggests that AKI in COVID  patients is a result of an interplay of virus mediated injury  a dysregulated inflammatory response  angiotensin II pathway activation  hypercoagulation  and microangiopathy   
These COVID specific factors likely interact with the other known risk factors for AKI  such as hemodynamic instability  hypoxia  and sepsis  which increased over time 
The increase in the cumulative incidence of AKI over time in our cohort is likely associated with concomitant clinical deterioration and less likely represent a unique renal effect of COVID 
Compared to studies of AKI in COVID  patients from other countries  we found our incidence to be higher than that reported from   Asian countries  –  and is similar to that in an Italian study             
However  it is lower than that in the more recent report by Hirsch et al 
  who detailed their experience in   academic and community hospitals in metropolitan New York   none of which are located in the inner city  lower socioeconomic neighborhoods with a predominant minority population 
As compared with the above cited studies  the incidence of stage   AKI   was highest in our cohort 
It is not possible to determine with certainty the cause s  of this wide variation 
However  we did note a higher prevalence of comorbid conditions in our group 
For example  Cheng et al 
  reported a   incidence of AKI  with a   prevalence of HTN and a   prevalence of DM in their study population 
In our cohort  roughly twice as many   had HTN  and more than   times as many   were diabetic  Table  
Also  the incidence of severe lung involvement that required mechanical ventilation was lower   than ours    Table  
Mechanical ventilation per se has been reported to be strongly associated with AKI   
In our cohort  the incidence of AKI was also higher among those requiring mechanical ventilation  We identified various risk factors for AKI in our study  Tables    
Similar to previous reports  our patients with AKI were more likely to be male  have a history of HTN  and have severe respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation     
In our study  higher BMI increased the likelihood of developing severe AKI 
A low eGFR at presentation more than doubled the risk of developing AKI  p      Table  
Patients with lower eGFR had a significantly higher cumulative incidence of AKI than those with eGFR   mL min  m   p     Fig 
 
Thus  there was a synergistic effect of reduced baseline kidney function and subsequent AKI 
We did not find an association between diabetes and in hospital AKI The role of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors  ACEi  in COVID  is a subject of ongoing debate 
ACEi can increase the expression of ACE  the receptor used by SARS CoV  to enter target cells     
However  ACE  has been shown to be beneficial in acute respiratory distress syndrome when replaced     
This possible protective effect is attributed to the degradation of proinflammatory angiotensin II to angiotensin by ACE 
At present  it remains unclear if ACEi facilitate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus    SARS CoV  cellular entry and intracellular virus replication and whether ACEi improve acute respiratory distress syndrome outcomes 
In our cohort  the use of ACEi was significantly higher in patients with a lower admitting eGFR  Table   and in those who experienced AKI  Table  
We found a similar association between AKI and non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs  but not with angiotensin II receptor blockers  ARBs  in our cohort  Table  
Further studies are necessary to delineate the relationship between ACEi  angiotensin II receptor blockers  and COVID  outcomes Markers of acute inflammation  ferritin and CRP  muscle injury  creatinine kinase  myocardial injury  and D dimer levels were significantly higher in patients with a low eGFR at presentation  online suppl 
Table   and in those with AKI  online suppl 
Table   suggesting causality by a dysregulated immune inflammatory response  the so called  cytokine storm We found an extremely high incidence of mortality in our study cohort 
High presenting BUN and low eGFR   mL min  m  were significantly associated with increased mortality  Table  
AKI was significantly associated with increased mortality 
The mortality risk was highest in stage   AKI  HR   CI  –   Table  
Mortality was   in the AKI group and   in the non AKI group  p    
Mortality rose concurrently with the AKI stages      and   for stages     and   respectively  Table  
These rates were over   and  fold higher than those reported by Hirsch et al 
    AKI    in non AKI 
However  our cohort s high mortality is similar to the findings of John Hopkins University and the American Community Survey 
They reported a   and  fold higher COVID  infection and mortality rate in predominantly African American counties than in predominantly white counties   
Wadhera et al 
  also reported a death rate of   per   in Brooklyn  about   higher than that of Manhattan 
Moreover  in New York City  current age adjusted mortality is highest among African Americans and about   times that of whites   Our hospital provides medical services for an ethnic minority and a low income population in the most impoverished neighborhood in Brooklyn  where   of the residents live below the Federal Poverty Level as per a   report   
  of our patients identified themselves as African Americans 
In comparison  in the study by Hirsch et al 
     identified themselves as whites  and only   identified themselves as African Americans 
The high representation of ethnic minorities in our study population may have contributed to the increased mortality 
This association has been widely publicized and is likely the result of a complex interplay of multiple factors 
These include  but are not limited to  a high burden of comorbidities  genetics  the pernicious influence of adverse socioeconomic determinants of health  the absence of the privilege to work from home  and the ability to follow the recommended social distancing   In our cohort      of the   patients with AKI required RRT 
Nineteen out of these   patients   were mechanically ventilated 
Thus  almost all of the additional requirements for acute dialysis during the COVID  pandemic at our institution were in intensive care units 
Overall      out of   of mechanically ventilated patients required RRT 
Elevated ferritin was associated with an increased risk of all stages of AKI and the need for RRT  online suppl 
Table  
Among those who received RRT      died versus     in the stage   AKI group who did not undergo RRT  p      Table  
Thus  there was no statistically significant improvement in survival  and the mortality remained extremely high in both the RRT and non RRT groups 
These findings should prompt the early involvement of a palliative care team to define goals of care in patients with COVID  disease and stage   AKI In our experience  ultrafiltration was not well tolerated 
It often increased pressor requirements and did little to improve the ventilatory status 
We observed a high incidence of hypercoagulability and frequent clotting of the dialysis filters  lines  and catheters 
Thus  the patients required higher than the usual doses of heparin Our study has limitations 
Although     of the study population had a low eGFR on admission  only     had a documented history of CKD 
Data were collected retrospectively from medical records and often did not have information regarding prior renal function 
Patients also may have had an elevated creatinine on admission secondary to AKI suffered prior to hospitalization 
If so  we may have underestimated the true overall incidence of COVID associated AKI 
It is not possible to rectify this problem  given the data at our disposal Our study is a single center study  with the majority of the study population identifying themselves as African Americans or Hispanics 
This limits our study s general applicability but provides a unique insight into this population and broadens our understanding of COVID  disease 
Data were missing on many patients at different stages of the hospitalization since they were collected retrospectively 
Importantly  little data were available regarding urine output  a defining characteristic of AKI 
With this lack of information  we may have again underestimated the true incidence of AKI Nevertheless  even with the above limitations of our study  the high incidence of AKI and its negative impact upon survival is abundantly clear 
In response to the high incidence of AKI in our patients with COVID  we increased our capacity to deliver RRT 
These efforts included the purchase of additional machines and dialysis solutions  additional staff training  and engineering alterations to allow dialysis on the general medical floors 
Also  we increased our stockpiles of catheters  filters  and dialysis solutions for intermittent and continuous RRT 
We also plan to establish a peritoneal dialysis program to further strengthen our acute dialysis capacity In conclusion  our data report explicitly upon a high proportion of ethnic minority patients in an inner city  severely economically deprived neighborhood  previously not studied 
Our patients experienced a high incidence of AKI and an extremely high mortality  especially in AKI stage  
Unfortunately  RRT provided little survival benefit 
Policy changes and planning in preparation for this high incidence of AKI in COVID  patients are necessary at the local and national levels Study was approved by Institutional Review Board  IRB  Brookdale Hospital The authors have no conflicts of interests to declare The authors did not receive any funding U Z

  supervisor Dynamic changes in computed tomography manifestations of   patients
with novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan  ChinaDuring the first week of December   a few cases of pneumonia caused by a novel
coronavirus appeared in Wuhan  Hubei Province  China 
The patients had a history of
visiting the nearby Huanan seafood market  where wild animals were sold  With the spread of the disease  such cases have also been found in other
parts of China and abroad 
As of   July     cases have been confirmed
worldwide  including   deaths and   recoveries The novel coronavirus was originally named   novel coronavirus  nCoV  it was
recently officially renamed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus  
 SARS CoV  by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses 
The disease
caused by SARS CoV  has been named coronavirus disease    COVID  by the World
Health Organization 
Like SARS CoV  SARS CoV  likely originated in bats  however 
the intermediary animal host remains unclear 
The nearest neighbor of the  nCoV
isolates from China is a bat SARS like coronavirus  Bat SL CoVZC SARS CoV  carries a high risk of human to human transmission  and such transmission
has been reported in family clusters and among medical workers  The main route of transmission
is respiratory droplets and contact transmission  the virus may also be transmitted
through the conjunctiva and via aerosols  Current epidemiological surveys indicate that the latency period generally
ranges from   to   days  with a maximum of   days 
Affected patients present with
pneumonia like symptoms  including fever  fatigue  cough  expectoration 
pharyngalgia  anorexia  and myalgia 
Some patients also have gastrointestinal
symptoms  including diarrhea  nausea  vomiting  and abdominal pain 
In severe cases 
patients may rapidly develop acute respiratory distress syndrome  septic shock 
difficult to correct metabolic acidosis  and coagulation dysfunction Increasing numbers of studies are suggesting the high clinical value of imaging
examinations  especially high resolution computed tomography  HRCT  of the chest  in
patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia –  Typical CT imaging
manifestations include multiple patchy subsegmental or segmental ground glass
opacities  GGOs  and consolidation in the bilateral lungs  The imaging manifestations in patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia often
change rapidly  and many patients thus undergo repeated CT examinations 
Some
patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia gradually improve  whereas others develop
persistent hypoxemia or dyspnea and gradually worsen 
The changes in the patient s
condition are often closely related to the severity of the lung lesions 
Therefore 
observing the evolution of the lung lesions by chest CT is very important to assess
and predict the patient s outcome This study was to performed observe the changes in the chest HRCT manifestations of
  patients with pneumonia caused by SARS CoV  from the time of the initial
diagnosis 
To our knowledge  this is the largest population evaluated to date among
studies of the dynamic changes in imaging manifestations of novel coronavirus
pneumonia Consecutive patients were retrospectively enrolled in this single center study
from   January   to   February  
These patients met the Diagnosis and
Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia  trial version   issued by the National
Health Commission of the People s Republic of China  and their diagnoses were confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction 
According to the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus
Pneumonia  trial version   issued by the Chinese National Health Committee 
patients who developed severe pneumonia during their disease course were
excluded 
Severe pneumonia was defined as severe respiratory distress
 respiratory rate of   breaths minute  a requirement for oxygen treatment
or mechanical ventilation  an oxygen saturation of   on room air  a
partial arterial oxygen pressure fraction of inspired oxygen ratio of ≤  mmHg 
shock  or pneumonia combined with other organ failure All patients were examined using a Discovery CT  HD scanner  GE Healthcare 
Chicago  IL  USA  during a single inspiratory phase 
Before the examination  the
medical staff guided the patient to hold his or her breath and inhale 
After
complete exhalation  the patient held his or her breath  and a CT scan was
performed from the bottom of the lung to the apex of the lung 
The tube voltage
was   kVp with automatic tube current modulation 
The scan time was   s  the
scan interval was   mm  and the scan layer thickness was   mm 
After scanning 
adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction of   and the standard algorithm
were adopted  and the reconstruction layer thickness was   mm 
No contrast
agent was used during the CT scan 
Most patients underwent multiple chest CT
examinations  largely because the clinicians were still unclear about the
evolution tendencies of the lung lesions associated with COVID  pneumonia 
Additionally  some patients had symptoms such as hypoxemia or dyspnea due to
rapid disease progression 
Therefore  multiple chest CT examinations were
required to observe the progress or absorption of pneumonia The major CT manifestations were described using internationally standard
nomenclature defined by the Fleischner Society glossary  using terms such as
GGO  consolidation  and fibrous strips  A semi quantitative scoring system was used to estimate the pulmonary
involvement of all of these abnormalities on the basis of the area involved  Each of the five lung lobes was visually scored from   to   as follows 
  no involvement      involvement      to   involvement      to
  involvement      to   involvement  and     involvement 
The
total CT score was the sum of the individual lobar scores and ranged from    no
involvement  to    maximum involvement 
The number of affected lung lobes was
also recorded 
The images were transferred to an AW  workstation  GE
Healthcare  and anonymized 
All images were evaluated by two radiologists with
more than   years of work experience  and the final scores were determined by
consensus Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS Statistics for Windows  Version
   SPSS Inc  Chicago  IL  USA 
Measurement data are expressed as
mean   standard deviation  minimum–maximum  and categorical data are presented
as the percentage of the group 
A P value of   was defined as
statistically significant In total    CT scans of   patients   men    women  with confirmed COVID 
were collected 
The patients  ages ranged from   to   years  and their mean
age was       years 
Fever was the most common symptom  Table  
The patients
underwent        –  chest CT examinations  and the interval between the
first and last scan was       days  –  days The laboratory results are presented in Table  
Most laboratory results were
normal  with mildly elevated concentrations of C reactive protein
      mg L  D dimers       mg L  and ferritin      
µg L Based on clinical experience  five stages were identified from the onset of
initial symptoms  Stage A  –  days  n     Stage B  –  days  n     Stage
C  –  days  n     Stage D  –  days  n     and Stage E   days 
n    
One patient had a  day history of cough with fever and was in Stage B
at the time of admission 
The frequencies of different lesions in different
stages are presented in Table  
Two patients in Stage A and one patient in Stage E had no
lesions 
Multiple lobes were involved in most of the CT scans in all stages 
Multiple lobe involvement was present in     patients in Stage A   
  in Stage B      in Stage C      in Stage D  and    
in Stage E  GGOs could be seen in all stages  and the proportion of GGOs in each
stage was similar 
The proportion of consolidation first increased and then
decreased over time 
GGOs and consolidation were present in     and  
  patients in Stage A      and     in Stage B     
and     in Stage C      and     in Stage D  and    
and     in Stage E  respectively 
The consolidations in some cases were
absorbed As shown in Table  
the total CT score also first increased and then decreased over time  and the
total CT score of pulmonary involvement was significantly higher in Stage B than
in Stage A       vs        respectively  P    
Additionally  the
total CT score of lung involvement was significantly higher in Stage C than in
Stages B and D       vs         P     and       vs       
 P     respectively 
The number of involved lobes was significantly higher
in Stage B than in Stage A       vs        respectively  P    
Notably  the CT score of the lower lobe was significantly higher than the
corresponding upper and middle lobes in Stages A  B  C  and D  P     for
all 
In Stage E  the CT score of the right lower lobe was significantly higher
than that of the right upper middle lobes  P     and P    
respectively  whereas no significant difference was observed in the CT score
between the left lower lobe and left upper lobe The CT images of a patient with novel coronavirus pneumonia are shown in Figure  
GGOs and
consolidation first increased from Stage A to Stage C  after which the
consolidation gradually absorbed  the GGOs then gradually decreased in Stages D
and E Since the end of   an outbreak of a novel pneumonia in Wuhan has been drawing
tremendous attention around the world 
Chinese government officials and researchers
have taken swift measures to control the outbreak and conduct etiological studies 
The causative agent of this pneumonia has been identified as SARS CoV  a novel
coronavirus 
As its name suggests  its genetic structure is   similar to that of SARS CoV The most frequently affected organ of the novel coronavirus is the lung 
In the
previous version of the diagnosis and treatment guideline for pneumonia caused by
novel coronavirus  the diagnosis was confirmed by the presence of viral nucleic
acids in throat swabs  sputum  and alveolar lavage fluid 
However  the more recent
guideline indicates that if typical chest CT findings are observed in patients
suspected to have COVID  the patient should be clinically diagnosed 
This
reflects the important role of chest CT in the diagnosis 
Moreover  current clinical
experience is showing that the chest CT manifestations change rapidly 
Therefore 
many patients in the present study underwent multiple repeated examinations during
treatment 
To our knowledge  this study is by far the largest case series of
follow up imaging among patients with COVID SARS CoV  infects human respiratory epithelial cells through S protein and has a
strong infection capacity for humans 
Coronavirus particles have a diameter of   to
  nm and can directly reach the bottom of the lung 
Because of lung volume and
gravity  respiratory airflow  and other factors  the type II alveolar epithelial
cells present at the bottom of the lung become the target cells of the coronavirus 
Therefore  the lesions are mainly distributed under the pleura or along the vascular
bronchial bundle  After the alveolar epithelial cells have become combined with the virus  the
alveolar wall is damaged and large numbers of immune cells and lymphocytes
accumulate  resulting in swelling around the lung leaflets and blood vessel
congestion 
The pulmonary lobules merge with each other  forming nodular or patchy
GGOs 
As the disease progresses  multiple lung segments become involved  the scope
of the lesion expands  the alveolar wall shrinks and collapses  and the exfoliated
and necrotic epithelium and the exuded inflammatory cells form a hyaline membrane 
These changes manifest as coexisting imaging abnormalities such as GGOs  nodules 
consolidation  and fibrous cord strips Several studies have focused on the evolution of CT changes in patients with COVID 
pneumonia 
Pan et al  analyzed the disease course according to  day stages and found that the CT
score was the highest on days   to   of the disease course  after   days  the CT
score of the lower lung was significantly higher than that of the middle and upper
lungs 
Zhou et al  found that CT images of patients with COVID  pneumonia showed a
predominantly peripheral  middle  lower  and posterior distribution 
The early rapid
progressive stage was   to   days from symptom onset  the advanced stage with peak
levels of CT abnormalities occurred from   to   days  and the abnormalities started
to improve after   days 
Lei et al  reported that patients with COVID  pneumonia had a typical transition from
the early stage to the advanced stage and then from the advanced stage to the
dissipating stage 
Single or multiple GGOs were distributed along the
bronchovascular or subpleural regions in the pulmonary parenchyma in the early
stage  higher density consolidations were observed in the advanced stage  and the
GGOs and consolidations were absorbed in the dissipating stage 
Xiang et al  evaluated only six patients with COVID  pneumonia and reported that the CT
score peaked at   to   days and that the CT scores of the lower lobes were
significantly higher than those of the middle upper lobes after   days from disease
onset 
These findings were consistent with those reported by Pan et al  Liang et al  reported that the majority of patients had involvement of three or more
lobes 
Bilateral involvement was more prevalent than unilateral involvement 
The
proportions of patients observed to have pure GGOs or GGOs and consolidation
decreased over time  while the proportion of patients with GGOs and linear opacities
increased 
The total severity score showed an increasing trend in the first   weeks 
Bernheim et al  divided the disease course into three stages  –   –  and  –  days  and
found that   of patients in the first stage had normal CT findings 
As the time
since onset of symptoms increased  the CT abnormalities became more frequent  these
findings included consolidation  bilateral and peripheral disease  greater total
lung involvement  linear opacities  the  crazy paving  pattern  and the  reverse
halo  sign In this study  we evaluated the CT findings of   patients with COVID  pneumonia
confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction 
The patients underwent
a mean of        range   –  chest CT examinations 
At present  the course of
COVID  pneumonia and when patients should be re examined remain inconclusive 
As
mentioned above  different studies have staged the disease according to different
time periods 
We grouped the patients  CT scans at different time intervals 
The
time interval grouping was based on current clinical experience and is consistent
with the imaging interval described in the pneumonia diagnosis and treatment guidelines  This grouping is also partially similar to that described by Pan et al  and Zhou et al  Multiple lobe involvement was observed in most patients in all stages  and
lower lobe lesions were significantly more common than upper and middle lobe
lesions  this is also consistent with the findings reported by Pan et al  and Liang et al  As mentioned above  most studies have suggested that patients with COVID 
pneumonia undergo a typical transition from the early stage to the advanced stage
and then from the advanced stage to the dissipating stage  however  the time to
reach the peak of the disease course varies among different studies  and the
patients in our study showed a similar tendency 
GGOs and consolidation were the
common chest CT manifestations  the proportion of GGOs in each stage was similar 
while consolidation and the total CT score first increased and then decreased over
time 
The total CT score was significantly higher in Stage B than in Stage A  while
the total CT score was significantly higher in Stage C than in Stage B 
These
findings suggest that the lung lesions of most patients significantly improved after
  days and that most patients with new coronavirus pneumonia had a disease course
of more than   days This study had three main limitations 
First  we did not consider the effects of
factors such as age  sex  medical history  including hypertension  hyperlipidemia 
hyperglycemia  and malignant tumors  and lifestyle habits  including smoking and
drinking history  on patient outcomes 
Second  although   patients with novel
coronavirus pneumonia were included in this study  the number of patients in Stages
B to E was limited 
Future studies should include more patients and extend the
observation time to ensure that the study results are more representative 
Third 
some studies have suggested that factors such as age  the C reactive protein
concentration  and the interleukin  β concentration may be related to patient
outcomes 
However  we did not perform a correlation analysis between the laboratory
data and patient outcomes In conclusion  we followed up and evaluated   chest CT scans of   patients with
confirmed COVID  pneumonia and found that most patients had a disease course of
more than   days and that the lung lesions of most patients improved significantly
after   days 
The purpose of this study is to help clinicians better understand the
disease course and properly perform chest CT re examinations for patients with
COVID  pneumonia to minimize the radiation dose Transdermal Delivery Systems for BiomoleculesDrug delivery is related to many problems focused on the molecular stability  pharmacokinetic  and amphoteric nature of a substance 
Due to chemical instability and high degradation by enzymatic action regardless of the distance to the specific target organ  all of this is more complicated when the bioactive substance that is intended to be administered is a biomolecule  such as peptides and proteins   Currently  there is a system that is applied to the protein drug delivery  which is a non conventional system developed primarily for protein and peptide drug delivery 
This new delivery system has a higher efficiency that improves the passage of the protein drug to the skin   
The transdermal drug delivery  TDD  system reduces potential exposure to side effects in the host and improves protein stability by also reducing enzymatic degradation  which is very common to occur when a drug takes the most conventional routes to enter the body  such as oral and subcutaneous routes 
Mainly  TDD systems avoid the first pass of metabolism  which occurs in the liver   
The protein and peptide drugs are important in many innovative treatments  such as immunotherapy  where biomolecules  such as antibodies  growth factors  and interleukins  are used 
These are proteins with high susceptibility to degradation to many endogenous and exogenous factors  such as temperature and pH  and most importantly  enzymatic degradation and immune clearance One of the most important advantages of the transdermal route is to maintain drug release in a constant and prolonged release to achieve optimal blood circulation concentrations   
For transdermal protein drug delivery systems  specific methods or devices are used to allow or enhance intact passage through the stratum corneum  SC 
The most suitable systems for the release of biomolecules are the third generation transdermal delivery systems  whose effects are directed to the SC 
For TDD systems of biomolecules and vaccines  thermal ablation and microneedles are the most widely used physical penetration enhancers 
However  there are many other systems that have been tested for transdermal release of biomolecules   that have been included in the second and third generation of transdermal delivery systems  such as iontophoresis and electroporation This article highlights the main technologies used as tools that improve transdermal protein drug delivery systems  addressing them from the point of view of research in the development of transdermal systems where many technologies and devices have a high possibility of use in conventional drug treatments  such as nanotechnology devices 
The authors provide an overview of the various systems that exist in TDD that have been tested and proposed for the transdermal delivery of biomolecules The skin is a three layer laminate that is made up of the SC  the epidermis  and the dermis   
The epidermis is the outermost layer and is formed from the stratified epithelium  the stratum germinativum  spinosum  granulosum  lucidum  and corneum   Fig 
 The SC is the outermost and impermeable skin layer that prevents the entry of most chemicals   
This barrier is formed by around   to   lines of dead keratinocytes  corneocytes  that have united with each other with corneodesmosomes forming a wall embedded in a lipidic matrix 
The extracellular matrix is formed by lipids  such as fatty acids  ceramides  cholesterol  cholesterol sulfate  and sterol wax esters arranged in lamellae  and multiple lipid bilayers  although the matrix is primarily composed of ceramides     
Corneocytes contain involucrin  loricrin  and cornifin around their periphery and have a thickness of   μm  but this can be modified by factors such as hydration and the anatomic site of the skin   
This stratum contains high amounts of keratin inside the corneocytes  and the keratin filaments provide the hexagonal shape and stratum mechanical strength of the corneocyte   
In addition  the SC acts as a barrier  preventing desiccation and pathogen entry and protecting against ultraviolet rays 
The SC also plays an important role in wound repair The transdermal delivery route has been used many times for the local application of therapeutic substances  and it is a practice that is still used and that will continue to grow in the coming years The transdermal drug delivery systems also allow homogeneous absorption and have good pharmaceutical efficiency  reducing the adverse effects that drugs could cause in the host and reduce the drug risk to suffer alterations caused by enzymatic factors and the immune system present in the intrinsic environment 
Besides that  these systems are more comfortable for the patient   This method is formed by steps that start when the therapeutic molecule enters the skin until it enters the blood circulation 
The first step is penetration  which occurs when the drug is deposited onto the specific skin layer 
Later  the permeation step occurs when the molecule diffuses from one layer to another 
Finally  in the resorption process  the drug enters the bloodstream     This type of drug delivery system has advantages over traditional systems because it can allow the storage of small amounts of drugs in the transport and delivery structure  which are developed by nanotechnology using mainly polymeric nanomaterials made with biopolymers  microneedles  and nanoparticles With these devices  it is possible to improve drug delivery and its bioavailability 
Thus  it is possible to reduce the frequency between drug administrations 
The most innovative property is that the device is only replaced when the dose is finished and it can take several days     
The exact side effects that they could trigger are unknown  since they could mainly depend on the type of bioactive drug it contains  which could be related to some effects of the mechanical properties of the skin    Table  Peptides and proteins have long been important resources in the treatment of many diseases 
Many of the therapies that are applied for many diseases have recently used peptides and proteins  which is called biological therapy and focuses on the production of the main proteins obtained from living organisms such as transforming bacteria The main diseases which are treated with proteins are diabetes  hemophilia  infectious diseases  and anemia 
These therapeutic proteins are primarily hormones  interleukins  anticoagulants  and enzymes  which are recombinant proteins 
Other protein drugs  such as calcitonin  rituximab  gemtuzumab  insulin  epidermal growth factor  and interferons  are best known for their importance in the treatment of osteoporosis  lymphoma  leukemia  and diabetes mellitus   The most employed biological protein therapy is immunotherapy  which has several applications 
One of the most important applications is cancer treatment  which is a specific treatment that employs cytokines  a kind of protein produced by the immunity system that helps the patient s immune system eliminate cancer cells and prevents the replication of cancer cells 
These immune proteins are classified in therapeutic groups known as cytokines  monoclonal antibodies  tyrosine kinase inhibitor  and rapamycin receptor inhibitors in mammals  mTOR    
Two main kinds of cytokines are the most importantly used in biological therapies  interleukins and interferons 
Production is carried out with laboratory animals and once extracted and purified  they are used by injection into a human recipient for clinical treatment  e g  monoclonal antibodies 
However  there are many applications for products  such as antibodies obtained from live organisms and these are used mainly for the prevention of diseases such as in the development of vaccines 
The most important pharmaceutical products are listed in Table     Each one of these peptides or proteins has a different method of administration  such as intravenous  oral  topical  or intravesical 
Some other proposed methods of administration that would avoid the difficulties of the route of administration and offer comfort to the user include the nasal  pulmonary  ocular  and rectal routes    which could be as invasive as the traditional routes in many cases 
The main drawback of this type of therapies is that traditional administration such as subcutaneous injection and intravenous administration can modify their effectiveness  since the route of administration may vary in different clinical circumstances  for example  it may contribute to an increase in blood pressure   When any substance  including proteins  enters the bloodstream regardless of the route of administration  these proteins are exposed to many environmental threats such as sequestration by the reticuloendothelial system mainly for macrophage internalization  enzymatic degradation and absorption and elimination of serum proteins by the liver  –   which is an important factor to consider  since it represents a low efficiency in the application of biological therapy due to its high rate of degradation and elimination   
In addition to protecting the lability of all therapeutic proteins  it is also about preventing them from exerting their activity in places that do not require it 
Although immunotherapy is more effective and less toxic than therapies made with chemical molecules  these immune proteins also trigger adverse effects in the host  such as autoimmunities and non specific inflammatory processes   
For these reasons  research is being carried out on the use of alternative technologies with which these side effects can be controlled  such as with the use of nanotechnology using polymers  with which these proteins can be protected  favoring their transport and direct delivery to their objective  preventing them from exerting their toxic effect on non specific cells and sites   Nanocarriers  such as nanotubes    microneedles  MNs   –   fusion peptide carriers    or peptide conjugated nanoparticles  NPs      are some of the main carriers and protective systems used in immunotherapy  regardless of the size or structure of the molecule to be transported and protected  which could be genetic material  interferon  interleukins  or antibodies In   the US FDA approved the use of TDD systems and their use has been increasing in relevance for protein drugs because for some molecules these delivery systems improve the solubility of the compound  in addition to allowing it to pass efficiently through the skin There are important findings in research revealing that TDD technologies allow the loading  transport  and release of protein drugs 
They are very promising for the effective treatment of local cancers  with skin location  and they have a second benefit of activating the immune system from a remote distance 
Some of them have been developed to carry ribonucleic acid  RNA  that can regulate localized gene expression within a known target 
In other cases  it is possible to use an immunologic protein that could produce a strong adaptive immune response against a specific antigen in the case of vaccines  where it could be made with the tumor antigen expressed in the gene  tumor related protein or peptide  specific epitope  or cell lysate   For immunotherapy  it might be possible to employ monoclonal antibody loaded TDD systems and tumor agnostic therapies  non specific immunotherapies  use of interferons and interleukins  and cancer theranostic treatment where SC could be interrupted by a nanogel delivering a drug through the skin and allowing it to accumulate at the tumor site   or these systems may even function by delivering vaccine antigens  cancer vaccines  using nanoparticles and liposomes as antigenic carriers loaded on nanogels to pass the antigen through the SC by iontophoresis   
It is also possible to use microneedles loaded with Dermatophagoides farinae extract to achieve effective allergen release and effective immune response induction   These strategies have a wide range of application in various skin pathological circumstances  in addition to their main role in cancer therapy  and many products are used for the treatment of cancer 
Some of the commercial pharmaceutical products used for cancer therapy  which are administered transdermally  are described in Table     Through the use of transdermal delivery systems  it is sought to increase the solubility and stability  the circulating life  and the pharmacokinetic properties of drug proteins and peptides 
It is recommended to consider that the TDD system is not applicable to many of the biomolecules that are used as medical treatments since the success in the transdermal passage could depend on certain factors 
The efficacy of this therapeutic system depends both on the physical and chemical properties of the proteins and on the percutaneous administration systems of biomolecules to be used 
Regarding protein  the main physical properties to consider are the shape and size  molecular weight  solubility  and amphoteric nature  the latter being perhaps one of the most important to consider since due to its amphoteric property it can migrate in an electric field and its migration direction depends on the net charge that it has 
The knowledge of this property could help to elucidate which are the best percutaneous administration systems to facilitate passage through the SC 
In the case of charged proteins  physical  electrical  enhancers are the best option to use 
The chemical nature of proteins is another especially important factor to know 
This composition could help us to choose the best TDD system through which the protein will pass through the SC avoiding the reactivity of some functional groups of proteins 
For these reasons  there is little increase in the development of new therapeutic formulations administered by TDD systems  since there are some protein properties that need to be studied and analyzed to know if they can be administered by this route without affecting its stability and pharmacokinetic properties Peptides are molecules that have a molecular weight between   Da and   kDa 
This molecular weight depends on the molecular structures and their lengths with a small amount of amino acids or constitutes a protein with a complex structure 
These molecules are charged in a physiological pH and are hydrophilic  which complicates their permeability across the skin 
Some drugs have a lower or higher affinity with the lipophilic condition of the SC  which determines the quantity of the molecule that can cross this layer of the skin naturally 
Therefore  it is better to use a technique that improves passage to the skin  using or not natural permeation molecular routes avoiding the degradation of peptides or proteins and ensuring passage and integrity during the transport and release processes   There are important skin conditions that can change permeability  such as age  heat  racial differences  freezing  abrasion  chemical irritant activity  and some diseases such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis 
It is very important to recognize these for the development and use of devices employed in transdermal protein drug delivery In the skin  three molecular permeation routes are the most important  intracellular  intercellular  and follicular routes 
All of these are beneficiated by the concentration gradient of the molecules present in the milieu  allowing passive diffusion across the SC   
Moreover  physicochemical properties from the molecule affect its passage through the SC 
Hydrophobic molecules can cross the SC intercellularly  whereas hydrophilic molecules cross intracellularly by corneocytes 
Passage through the skin can take place through so called cutaneous defects  in which the skin has a discontinuity  such as sweat glands or hair shafts   In the skin  the SC and lipid layers have a barrier function  as both prevent the loss of water and avoid the entry of any substances  molecules  or microorganisms from the environment or microbiome 
These layers play a crucial role in the passive passage of proteins and other chemicals into the skin 
The liquid flux between the lipid layer depends on the lamellar and linear lipid matrix arrangement 
The lamellar layer is generally oriented parallel to the SC  and linear lipids are perpendicular to the SC 
If no long periodicity phase  LPP  exists  the permeability increases   
However  if the orthorhombic phase  OP  predominates  the permeability of the lipids is reduced  and if the OP predominates in the lateral layer  the permeation decreases   
The LPP is primarily formed by ceramides  cholesterol  and free fatty acids  and these have a unique tri layer organization  while an all trans chain lipid organization exists in the OP phase  which has a rectangular crystalline lattice and no mobility Transdermal drug delivery has been used for many years  and the skin was thought to be impervious to exogenous chemical molecules 
Currently  it is known that the skin is a semi permeable barrier  which allows its use as a transport route for molecules  allowing the molecule to reach the therapeutic target intact 
However  due to its anatomy  hydrophilic molecules can only pass through the skin if they are small  and even then  in many cases  they require help from an electric field  electrotherapies  as in the case of electroporation   and iontophoresis   
These techniques use a low voltage supplementation  direct current  around the drug site  allowing and enhancing passage through the skin   
When an electric field is applied to the skin  a large molecular movement occurs and the molecule can take the path of the hair follicle through the skin or induce pore formation     There is another technology using acoustic transmission  sonophoresis  that is used in medical trials  such as hyperthermia treatment  physical therapy  and ultrasonic surgery  which has the ability to facilitate drug transport to the skin   
Through this technique  mechanical waves of medium or low frequency are transferred to a physical medium  such as a specific gel  which allows it to propagate and transmit energy 
In the ultrasonic system  wave sounds have an oscillation frequency greater than   kHz   The TDD systems are an alternative route that allows the control of the drug release and decreases the possibility of any side effects associated with levels that are higher than the minimum pharmacological concentration  reducing pharmacological dosing times because a patch is administered every   to   h  This eliminates the risk of metabolism of the therapeutic agent and the loss of the available dose 
In addition  there are other advantages  such as the noninvasive drug delivery method  which can be discontinued at any time   
To facilitate TDD to improve SC permeation  some technologies improve drug flux of difficult drugs    such as cryioneumatic and photpneumatic technologies  sonphoresis  iontophoresis  electroporation  jet injection  and MN  which are used in the delivery of many drugs   The disadvantage in the above cases is that all devices require a low voltage supplement 
In addition  it is necessary to purchase equipment to manage the electrical current 
In addition  in some people it can cause sensitivity  such as tingling and irritation  and the technique can even cause blistering of the skin 
In these cases  when the technique is not well applied  it can cause burns to the skin 
In all circumstances  these techniques must be applied by trained personnel Despite these drawbacks  considerable research has been focused on the transport of peptides through the skin with good results 
In Table   we list some examples of these studies  the biomolecules and penetration enhancers  and the main result of each 
The table also indicates whether the physical penetration enhancer acts alone or is enhanced by a combination with another enhancer or nanocarrier    –  Many compounds have been employed to improve the penetration of substances across the skin  such as azone  pyrrolidones  alkanols  sulfoxides  glycols  alcohols  and surfactants   
Each of the chemical penetration enhancers has a specific action mechanism in the skin penetration process Due to the characteristics of the upper layer of the skin  which is specialized in avoiding and preventing the entry of any molecule or pathogen  the SC is complicated in terms of the passage of molecules greater than   Da  but it is not impossible 
In many cases  this process can be carried out using penetration enhancer molecules  which have good results in terms of penetration of molecules through the skin 
However  it represents a disadvantage because it could permit not only pathogens but also microorganisms in the cutaneous microbiota to enter as a consequence of cellular disruption integrity and the focal detachment of superficial corneocytes  such as in the use of thioglycolate in depilatory treatments   
The process of percutaneous absorption of a therapeutic molecule consists of several processes  which include the dissolution and release of the therapeutic agent  partition and diffusion within the SC  partition from the SC to the aqueous phase of the epidermis and its diffusion  and finally  access to the systemic circulation and target tissue There are three routes through which any molecule can breach this and reach the microcirculation through the tissue 
These are the intercellular  transcellular  and transappendageal routes  but the route can depend on the drug s molecular weight  Fig 
    Chemical penetration enhancers are a good alternative to allow the passage of biomolecules  but most of them cause skin irritation  which is uncomfortable for patients   
In many cases  the penetration enhancers have synergic activity when they are used in combination    but they can generate more skin irritation problems 
The mode of action of these enhancers is different for each one and depends on the mechanism by which it interacts with the compounds of the SC 
Due to this capacity  it has been classified according to their interaction ability in those that  a  interact with lipid heads within aqueous domains of the lipid bilayers and interact with the lipid alkyl chain   b  interact with actin filaments in the corneocytes   c  allow partitioning augmentation and increase drug protein solubility in the SC  and  d  improve penetration indirectly  modifying the drug  Fig 
    
Some of the most studied chemical penetration enhancers are the terpenes  amide  fatty acids  monoglycerides  and surfactants  and some of the most commonly studied are  D limonene  azone  lauric acid  monoolein and sodium lauryl sulfate   Depending on their chemical structure  some polymers can transport drug molecules within their structure  as in the case of cyclodextrins and their derivatives together with other saccharides  moieties  that can transport drugs as ketoprofen   or biomolecules such as levothyroxine sodium  T  which has been used as a topical treatment to eliminate lipid deposits in subcutaneous adipose tissue 
The main problem with this type of application has been the IT  detection in rabbits   h after the application of the cream 
The use of dimethyl cyclodextrin as a solubilizer for levothyroxine increased its solubility  but unfortunately  it only succeeded in penetrating much less levothyroxine through the skin than the required dose in humans   
In this way  it is important to highlight that the complex improves the solubility of the molecule allowing it to pass through the SC  and in another specific treatment  it could recognize a specific target in the cell plasma membrane and then adhere to it and release its content in a more efficient way Proteins are a substantial problem when we try to pass them through the skin 
First  they are larger  and second  they are highly susceptible to enzymatic degradation 
Not all are thermostable  and finally  another difficulty is that proteins and peptides live for a short time in plasma 
For this  it is necessary to protect them during their trip to the place of action 
Furthermore  this protection enables controlled delivery 
Passing through the skin can be less difficult if the protein is in a capsule  which is best when the capsule size is in the nanometric range Advances in the science of polymers applied in pharmacy have allowed the development of many encapsulation techniques that range from the most impractical to the most revolutionary methods 
However  this reveals a problem  as some polymers are not soluble in water and require organic solvents 
Furthermore  the integrity of the protein to be encapsulated is compromised regardless of the encapsulation technique Many types of polymers could be used in drug delivery  however  their chemical structure and molecular weight do not allow dissolution in water in many cases  and most dissolve well in organic solvents 
The solubility of the polymer is a characteristic that is important to determine before use because it can determine the environmental resistance in the process in which it will be used Biopolymers and their combinations are best used for these procedures  helping to improve the stability of the formulation as in the case of encapsulating transforming growth factor  TGF β  in poly d l lactic co glycolic acid   PLGA  and polyethylene glycol  PEG  polymeric microparticles for bone regeneration   
Insulin loaded PCL PEG PCL NPs are another example where the NPs were prepared by the w o w double emulsion solvent evaporation method and demonstrated satisfactory insulin delivery and efficacy in treating diabetic rats   
These NPs possess a specific protein drug delivery with a delivery degradation speed 
They are hydrophobic or hydrophilic according to what is necessary for the encapsulation procedure and for improvement in the stability of the protein drug 
They have a low or no chance of rejection and are safe to use Encapsulation processes are classified into two types  chemical and mechanical  which are then classified according to the methodology used to make the capsule 
This can be determined according to the desired size  shape  and composition surface chemistry 
The encapsulation of biomolecules by these methods allows us to avoid the degradation of the free protein and allows the prolonged and constant release of a protein drug in constant time     With these methods  it is possible to obtain nano sized particles  which are especially important to avoid their elimination by the immune system and the liver   
Smaller and softer particles can better evade the immune system  and this can be compatible with the recipient organism 
It is important to note that capsules with a diameter size of ≤  μm have the risk of being engulfed by phagocytic immune cells  therefore  the recommended NP size that could have an appropriate delivery range is   to   nm   Dendrimers are three dimensional NPs  like macromolecules  and are considered based on nanometric size 
These are radially symmetric and comprise an inner core structure made up of a central atom covalently bonded between other atoms 
The external composition is highly branched  forming a dendrimer structure 
These branches allow the formation of cavities into which bioactive molecules   can be incorporated  such as proteins   and peptides used for many pathological treatments   and for storage  transport  and controlled delivery There are many types of dendrimer structures  and depending on the synthesis method  these methods could use click chemistry   and divergent and convergent strategies 
In addition  there are different designs and chemical elements 
Their application in the administration of drugs has focused on the fact that these have many biocompatible characteristics 
These characteristics include non immunogenicity  non toxicity  and a high ability to cross biological barriers  such as cell membranes  blood vessels  intestines  and the blood brain barrier   In addition  they have high stability in blood circulation and a prolonged blood circulation half life  and they target specific structures 
These NPs can be manufactured in high purity and have some degree of in vitro toxicity when manufactured with cationic and anionic surface groups 
However  it is possible to reduce this toxicity by using surface protection by PEGs or fatty acids   In TDD systems  dendrimers have been employed for the penetration of nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs  such as indomethacin  which is an arthritis and osteoarthritis auxiliary drug in the treatment of the pain generated from this disease 
There is a study that reports the progress of the TAT PAMAM dendrimer system developed as a non viral vector for the transdermal release of DNA plasmids where the dendrimer system was modified 
The HIV transcriptional transactivator  TAT  was conjugated as a cell penetrating peptide to enhance the uptake of constructed plasmid DNA pIRES H GFP by cells   
Dendrimers are an excellent drug penetration enhancer   and they are some of the best nanostructures that have high applicability in medicine for the delivery of peptides and proteins As mentioned  traditional routes  intradermal  gastric  or intravenous  have long been the main delivery route for all drugs 
Nevertheless  the appearance of an increase in chronic diseases has allowed the development of new technologies that are less invasive and have high efficiency upon reaching the target  especially in cases in which a user must take more than one medicine for the treatment of one or more diseases at a time Although the design and use of MNs can ensure the entrance of molecules across the skin  biomolecules have a high degradation risk that can occur at any time  in the charging process or at the moment of release 
Thus  it is better to protect the protein contained within a specialized structure  such as nanocapsules or dendrimers  NPs in both cases 
This procedure has no danger for the protein or peptide structural composition  which improves the conservation and passage of these compositions across the SC  Fig 
 The PLGA NPs can go through SC better with the help of MNs because the micro conduits created by these needles allow the NPs to avoid the SC barrier and arrive at other skin layers and deliver the complete contents  Fig 
    
For this procedure  it is necessary to consider that  in all cases  the penetration capacity of NPs depends on the particle and channel size   
Despite this important consideration  among others  the procedure also avoids the limitations of the skin s physicochemical properties that do not permit crossing it Some experimental studies have demonstrated the penetration and distribution of PLGA NPs in MNs   
The most common use of NPs MNs is for experimental insulin release systems using murine models in rats with induced diabetes  where the insulin is introduced into H O responsive mesoporous silica NPs  and MN patches are manufactured for later transdermal application 
Its release behavior analysis demonstrated effective release   
For immunity induction  an excellent response occurs when the NPs MNs were employed 
For example  for the induction of immunity against endogenous prostate cancer stem cell antigen RALA pPSCA  the immunization via the NP MN release system resulted in anti tumor activity in both cases of prophylactic and treatment assays in vivo   
Another experimental process that allows probing the system efficacy is the use of poly methylmethacrylate  coated with   nm of gold NPs  which has great potential in tumoral cell destruction   Currently  there are few authorized devices  however  these are increasing because for many treatments  such devices are more appropriately used  effective  and exhibit more recommended results 
Perhaps shortly  these devices will be the most appropriate techniques for drug and protein delivery systems For many decades  a great number of therapies to resolve the problems associated with drug release have been implicated to probe numerous kinds of devices and pharmaceutical innovations to solve many diseases or applications in various clinical trials for the diagnosis of diseases or treatments of diseases 
For this application  it is necessary to design new technologies  and pharmaceutical chemistry has been concerned with offering the best administration methods for therapeutic agents Lately  many research studies have reported numerous results that indicate the most appropriate technologies to use in each case of a drug delivery system 
Each of the aforementioned TDD systems has some advantages and disadvantages for use in administering protein drug delivery However  these technologies create substantial and important opportunities for administering biomolecules 
In the coming years  we will observe an increase in their design  development  characterization  and clinical trials for the treatment of many important and chronic diseases SARS CoV  recruits a haem metabolite to evade antibody immunityDNA fragments encoding SARS CoV  S   Uniprot ID  P DTC  residues  –  NTD  –  RBD  –  SARS CoV  S   Uniprot ID  P  residues  –  HCoV NL   Uniprot ID  Q Q S  residues  –  HCoV OC   isolate LRTI  NCBI accession code KX  residues  –  were codon optimised for expression in human cells and cloned into pQ C xStrep vector   under control of the cytomegalovirus  CMV  promoter for production of the recombinant proteins carrying a C terminal extension containing human rhinovirus    C protease recognition site followed by a TwinStrep tag

Editor
As new research has emerged about COVID  transmission  personal protective equipment  PPE  and patient management guidelines have evolved 
This has led to rapid guideline changes within healthcare systems 
Conflicting guidelines can contribute to miscommunication  increased stress  and reduced cohesion among surgical teams 
To successfully implement new guidelines during times of crisis  specific and timely feedback can be used to identify and resolve breaches in infection control  and promote feelings of support among healthcare workers Although inherently less complex than live surgery  feedback in stressful simulated scenarios can provide information about common pitfalls and provide a safe environment in which to practice new skills 
Our group found that when under stress  mental practice coaching combined with feedback significantly enhanced performance compared to simulation alone by better preparing individuals to execute action 
Feedback and mental rehearsal can help improve individuals  knowledge of guidelines and confidence in their abilities to perform under stress 
Critical skills to master in this new environment include PPE donning and doffing  performing procedures on COVID positive patients while in PPE  and new workflow protocols Within normal workflow  new technical skills and adherence to new operative safety protocols may be improved by video based feedback 
In a randomized study  coached trainees using video feedback made approximately half the number of technical errors when compared with those receiving conventional training 
This coaching has been extremely well received when implemented in multidisciplinary teams 
Non technical performance can also be improved through structured curricula combined with debriefing and feedback Under the best of circumstances  it can be challenging to provide the feedback necessary to maintain and improve individual and team performance 
Our team developed the operating room  OR  Black Box®  Surgical Safety Technologies  Inc    a technology that continuously captures and synchronizes multiple sources of intraoperative video and audio data 
Postoperatively  analysts identify safety threats and resilience supports that may respectively contribute to  or help to avoid adverse events  so targeted interventions can be implemented to promote patient safety 
Over the last ten years  our group has researched effective ways to reduce surgical error and optimize surgical safety using feedback – To address the need for feedback during the COVID pandemic at our institution  we developed the COVID Black Box 
Data from simulation scenarios on COVID positive patients recorded via the COVID Black Box is assessed to detect breaches in infection control practices  and identify suboptimal performance for improvement 
Specific and timely feedback is provided to equip OR personnel on how to correct misinformation  improve responses  and facilitate behavioural change on an operative team level 
Although formal analysis has yet to be conducted  qualitative downstream effects of feedback observed include an increased sense of control  reduced stress  improved team communication  feelings of managerial support  and more positive attitudes indicative of the organizational safety culture During this global pandemic  hospitals and surgical departments should not underestimate the importance of providing their teams with feedback 
Hospitals without comprehensive recording capabilities should establish systematic methods of providing feedback to OR teams such as video recording operations or assigning dedicated observers to record breaches in safety practices 
This feedback should be presented to surgical teams immediately and continuously  and collated for the larger institution on a regular basis to transparently communicate lessons learned from previous surgical cases 
Specific and timely feedback may reduce preventable errors in surgery during the pressures of the pandemic 
With ongoing effort to support our surgical teams and better performance  we can help our front line OR staff and patients during both the first  and subsequent waves of this pandemic Recombination Every Day  Abundant Recombination in a Virus during a Single Multi Cellular Host InfectionAs increasing numbers of full length viral sequences become available  recombinant or mosaic viruses are being recognized more frequently   
Recombination events have been demonstrated to be associated with viruses expanding their host range   or increasing their virulence    thus accompanying  or perhaps even being at the origin of  major changes during virus adaptation 
It remains unclear  however  whether recombination events represent a highly frequent and significant phenomenon in the everyday life of these viruses Viruses can exchange genetic material when at least two different viral genomes co infect the same host cell 
Progeny can then become hybrid through different mechanisms  such as reassortment of segments when the parental genomes are fragmented    intra molecular recombination when polymerases switch templates  in RNA viruses     or homologous or non homologous recombination  in both RNA and DNA viruses 
Quantification of viral recombination in multi cellular organisms has been attempted under two distinct experimental approaches  in vitro  in cell cultures     and in vivo  in live hosts    
The in vitro approach  which has so far been applied only to animal viruses  allows the establishment of the  intrinsic  recombination rate in experimentally co infected cells in cell cultures   
However  it does not necessarily reflect the situation in entire  living hosts  where the frequency of co infected cells is poorly known and depends on many factors such as the size of the pathogen population  the relative frequency and distribution of the different variants  and host defense mechanisms preventing secondary infection of cells 
The in vivo experimental approach is closer to biological conditions and may thus be more informative of what actually happens in  the real world However  as discussed below  numerous experimental constraints have so far precluded an actual quantification of the baseline rate of recombination 
First  many experimental designs have used extreme positive selection  where only recombinant genomes were viable  e g    
Other studies did not use complementation techniques but detected recombinants by PCR within infected hosts or tissues    which provides information on their presence but not on their frequency in the viral population 
So far  no quantitative PCR or other quantitative method has been applied to evaluate the number of recombinants appearing in an experimentally infected live host 
Finally  recent methods based on sequence analysis inferred the population recombination rate  rather than the individual recombination rate   
While results from these methods certainly take in vivo recombination into account  there are other caveats  isolates have often been collected in different hosts sometimes in different geographical regions and sometimes the selective neutrality of sequence variation on which these estimates are based is not clearly established 
Estimates from such studies by essence address the estimation of the recombination rate at a different evolutionary scale Taken together  the currently available information indicates that no viral recombination rate has ever been estimated directly at time and space scales corresponding to a single multi cellular host infection  although this level is most significant for the biology and evolution of viruses 
This study intends to fill this gap by evaluating the recombination frequency of the cauliflower mosaic virus  CaMV  during a single passage in one of its host plants  the turnip Brassica rapa CaMV is a pararetrovirus  which is a major grouping containing hepadnaviruses  e g  hepatitis B virus  badnaviruses  e g  banana streak virus  and caulimoviruses  e g  CaMV 
Pararetroviruses are characterized by a non segmented double stranded DNA genome 
After entering the host cell nucleus  the viral DNA accumulates as a minichromosome   whose transcription is ensured by the host RNA polymerase II   
The CaMV genome consists in approximately   bp and encodes six viral gene products that have been detected in planta  Figure     
Viral proteins P  to P  are expressed from two major transcripts  namely a  S RNA  encoding P  and a  S RNA corresponding to the entire genome and serving as mRNA for proteins P –P    
Using the pre genomic  S RNA as a matrix  the protein P   product of gene V  reverse transcribes the genome into genomic DNA that is concomitantly encapsidated   The detection of CaMV recombinants in turnip hosts has been reported numerous times 
Some studies have demonstrated the appearance of infectious recombinant viral genomes after inoculation  i  of a host plant with two infectious or non infectious parental clones   or  ii  of a transgenic plant containing one CaMV transgene with a CaMV genome missing the corresponding genomic region   
While the former revealed inter genomic viral recombination  the latter demonstrated that CaMV can also recombine with transgenes within the host s genome 
Another study based on phylogenetic analyses of various CaMV strains has clearly suggested different origins for different genomic regions and  hence  multiple recombination events during the evolution of this virus   
Indirect experimental evidence has indicated that  in some cases  CaMV recombination could occur within the host nucleus  between different viral minichromosomes  presumably through the action of the DNA repair cellular machinery   
Nevertheless  the mechanism of  template switching  during reverse transcription  predominant in all retroviruses  most certainly also applies to pararetroviruses 
For this reason  and on the basis of numerous experimental data  CaMV is generally believed to recombine mostly in the cytoplasm of the host cell  by  legal  template switching between two pre genomic RNA molecules    or  illegal  template switching between the  S and the  S RNA   
Under this hypothesis  recombination in CaMV could therefore be considered as operating on a linear template during reverse transcription  with the  ′ and  ′ extremities later ligated to circularize the genomic DNA  position   in Figure  
The above cited studies clearly demonstrate that CaMV is able to recombine 
However  since these studies are based on complementation techniques  non quantitative detection  or phylogenetically based inferences of recombination  they do not inform us on whether recombination is an exceptional event or an  everyday  process shaping the genetic composition of CaMV populations In the present work  we aimed at answering this question 
To this end  we have constructed a CaMV genome with four genetic markers  demonstrated to be neutral in competition experiments 
By co inoculating host plants with equal amounts of wild type and marker containing CaMV particles  we have generated mixed populations in which impressive proportions of recombinants distributed in several different classes corresponding to exchange of different genomic regions have been detected and quantified 
Altogether  the recombinant genomes averaged over   of the population 
Further analysis of these data  assuming a number of viral replications during the infection period ranging from five to   indicates that the per nucleotide per replication cycle recombination rate of CaMV is of the same order of magnitude  i e  on the order of a few   across the entire genome 
We thereby provide the first quantification  to our knowledge  of the recombination rate in a virus population during a single passage in a single host From Figure   and supposing that all marker containing genomic regions can recombine  we could predict the detection and quantification of seven classes of recombinant genotypes   bcd a  a cd b  ab d c  abc d   cd ab  a d bc  and a c b d 
Indeed  all classes were detected  and their frequencies in the ten CaMV populations analyzed are summarized in Table  Altogether  the proportion of recombinant genomes found in the mixed viral populations was astonishingly high and very similar in the ten co infected plants analyzed  Table   last column  ranging between    plant   to    plants     and   with a mean frequency   standard error  of      
This result indicates that recombination events are very frequent during the invasion of the host plant by CaMV and represents  to our knowledge  the first direct quantification of viral recombination during the infection of a live multi cellular host The inferred per generation recombination and interference rates  assuming that CaMV undergoes ten replication cycles during the   d between infection and sampling  are given for each of the ten plants in Table  
Recombination rates between adjacent markers are large  on the order of   to  
Taking the distance in nucleotides between markers into account yields an average recombination rate per nucleotide and generation on the order of      
Interestingly  this recombination rate does not vary throughout the genome  Kruskal–Wallis test  p    To relax the assumption of the number of replications during the   d  we calculated the recombination parameters assuming five or   generations 
The effect of the number of generations on the estimates is linear  doubling the number of generations results in a halving of the recombination rate  detailed results not shown 
For example  the average recombination rates r
  r
  and r
  assuming   generations were equal to     and   respectively  compare with values in Table   yielding per nucleotide per generation recombination rates of             and      Inspection of Table   also shows that first order interference coefficients were in general negative  indicating that a crossing over in one genomic segment increases the probability that a crossing over will occur in another genomic segment  while the second order coefficient parameter had an average value close to zero with a large variance 
The mechanism leading to these results will be discussed in the following section One major breakthrough in the work presented here lies in the space and time scales at which the experiments were performed 
Indeed  the processes occurring within the course of a single infection of one multi cellular host are of obvious biological relevance for any disease 
Previous studies on viral recombination suffered from major drawbacks in this respect  basing their conclusions on experiments relying on complementation among non infectious viruses or between viruses with undetermined relative fitness  on phylogenetically based analyses  or on experiments in cell cultures 
For reasons detailed in the Introduction  the first two methods either do not provide information on the frequency of recombination  but only its occurrence  or address the question at a different temporal  and often spatial  scale 
Results from cell cultures  on the other hand  impose cell co infection by different viral variants  potentially overestimating the frequency of recombination events 
Our study circumvents these limitations by analyzing viral genotypes sampled from infected plants after the course of a single infection  and therefore the invasion and co infection of cells in various organs and tissues is very close to natural More than half of the genomes       see Table   present in a CaMV population after a single passage in its host plant were identified as recombinants  and these data allowed us to infer a per nucleotide per generation recombination rate on the order of       to      
The time length of one generation  i e  the time required for a given genome to go from one replication to the next  is totally unknown in plant viruses 
The only experimental data available on CaMV are based on the kinetics of gene expression in infected protoplasts  where the capsid protein is produced between   and   h   
The reverse transcription and the encapsidation of genomic DNA being two coupled phenomena    we judged it reasonable to assume a generation time of   d and  thus  an average of ten generations during our experiments 
In case this estimate is mistaken  we have verified a linear relationship between r and the number of generations  thereby allowing an immediate adjustment of r if the CaMV generation time is more precisely established 
At this point  we must consider that all cloned genomes may not have been through all the successive replication events potentially allowed by the timing of our experiments 
It was previously shown that about   of CaMV mature virus particles accumulate in compact inclusion bodies    where they may be sequestered for a long time  as such inclusions are very frequent in all infected cells  including those in leaves that have been invaded by the virus population for several weeks 
The viral population may thus present an age structure that could bias the estimation of the recombination rate 
In order to minimize this bias  the clones we analyzed were collected in one young newly formed leaf  where the chances of finding genomes from  unsequestered lines  were assumed to be higher 
In any case  our data analysis is conservative  since this age structure can only lead to an underestimation of the recombination rate Our results show that interferences between pairs of loci are negative  a recombination event between two loci apparently increases the probability of recombination between another pair of loci 
We believe that the most parsimonious explanation of these negative interferences is based on the way the infection builds up within plant hosts 
Indeed  one can divide infected host cells into those infected by a single virus genotype and those infected by more than one viral genotype 
In the former  analogous to clonal propagation  recombination is undetectable 
In the latter  recombination is not only detectable but  as our results indicate  very frequent 
Samples consisting of viruses resulting from a mixture of these two types of host cell infections will thus contain viruses with no recombination and viruses with several recombination events  thus yielding an impression of negative interference 
These conceptual arguments are supported by mathematical models 
It is indeed easy to show  detailed results not shown  that if a proportion F of the population reproduces clonally  analogous to single infections  while the remaining reproduces panmictically  negative interferences could be inferred even if they do not exist 
For example  assuming a three locus model with real recombination rates r
  and r
  and interference i
  the  apparent  recombination and interference parameters  would be r
        F r  r
        F r
  and i
     F   i
    F 
Interestingly  this example also shows that our estimates of the recombination rate are conservative  that a fraction F of host cells are singly infected while others are multiply infected leads to an underestimation of the recombination rate As judged by r
  r
  and r
  calculated between markers a–b  b–c  and c–d  respectively  we found evidence for recombination through the entire CaMV genome 
The values for r
 
r
  and r
  are remarkably similar  hence the recombination sites seem to be evenly distributed along the genome 
We considered the template switching model as the major way recombinants are created in CaMV 
As already mentioned in the Introduction  hot spots of template switching have been predicted at the position of the  ′ extremities of the  S and  S RNAs   
If other recombination mechanisms  such as that associated with second strand DNA synthesis or with the host cell DNA repair machinery  act significantly  hot spots would be expected at the positions of the sequence interruption     and     
Due to the design of our experiment and the position of the four markers  we have no information on putative hot spots at positions corresponding to the  ′ end of the  S RNA and to    at nucleotide position  
Nevertheless  the putative hot spots at the  ′ end of the  S RNA and at   and    nucleotide positions   and   respectively  fall between marker pairs c–d  b–c  and a–b  respectively 
Our results indicate that either these hot spots are quantitatively equivalent though predicted by different recombination mechanisms or  more likely  that they simply do not exist 
Whatever the explanation  what we observe is that the CaMV can exchange any portion of its genome  and thus any gene thereof  with an astonishingly high frequency during the course of a single host infection To our knowledge  the viral recombination rate has never previously been quantified experimentally for a plant virus   
In contrast  retroviruses and particularly HIV  have been extensively investigated in that sense 
As we have already discussed for these latter cases  the quantification of the intrinsic recombination rate was carried out in artificially co infected cell cultures 
The estimated intrinsic per nucleotide per generation recombination rate in HIV  is on the order of      less than one order of magnitude higher than our estimation for CaMV 
Because for various reasons detailed above we probably underestimate the within host CaMV recombination rate  we believe that the intrinsic recombination rate in CaMV is higher and perhaps on the order of that of HIV Other pararetroviruses such as plant badnaviruses or vertebrate hepadnaviruses have a similar cycle within their host cells  including steps of nuclear minichromosome  genomic size RNA synthesis  and reverse transcription and encapsidation 
Nevertheless  vertebrate hepadnaviruses  e g  hepatitis B virus  infect hosts that are very different from plants in their biology and physiology  and this could lead to a totally different frequency of cell co infection during the development of the virus populations 
Thus  even though our results can be informative for other pararetroviruses because of the viruses  shared biological characteristics  they should not be extrapolated to vertebrate pararetroviruses without caution We used the plasmid pCa  which is the complete genome of the CaMV isolate Cabb S  cloned into the pBR  plasmid at the unique SalI restriction site   
To analyze recombination in different regions of the genome  we introduced four genetic markers  a  b  c  and d  at the positions       and   respectively  thus approximately at four cardinal points of the CaMV circular double stranded DNA of   bp  Figure  
All markers  each corresponding to a single nucleotide change  were introduced by PCR directed mutagenesis in pCa  and resulted in the duplication of previously unique restriction sites BsiWI  PstI  MluI  and SacI in a plasmid designated pMark S  Because  in this study  we targeted the possible exchange of genes between viral genomes  all markers a  b  c  and d were introduced within coding regions corresponding to open reading frames I  IV  V  and VI  respectively 
Another important concern was to quantify recombination in the absence of selection  i e  to create neutral markers 
Consequently all markers consist of synonymous mutations  see below To generate the parental virus particles  plasmids pCa  and pMark S were mechanically inoculated into individual plants as previously described   
All plants were turnips  B  rapa cv   Just Right  grown under glasshouse conditions at   °C with a    light dark  photoperiod 
Thirty days post inoculation  all symptomatic leaves were harvested and viral particles were purified as described earlier   The resulting preparations of parental viruses  designated Cabb S and Mark S  were quantified by spectrometry using the formula described by Hull et al 
  
We fixed the initial frequency of markers to a value of   and a solution containing   mg ml of virus particles of both Cabb S and Mark S at a   ratio was prepared 
Plantlets were co infected by mechanical inoculation of two to three leaves with   μl of this virus solution  using abrasive Celite AFA  Fluka  Ronkonkoma  New York  United States 
The mixed CaMV population was allowed to grow during   d of systemic infection We designed an experimental protocol for quantifying marker frequency within a mixed Cabb S Mark S virus population after a single passage in a host plant 
Twenty four individual plants  inoculated as above with equal amounts of Cabb S and Mark S  were harvested   d post inoculation  when symptoms were fully developed 
The viral DNA was purified from   mg of young newly formed infected leaves according to the protocol described previously   
After the precipitation step of this protocol  the viral DNA was resuspended and further purified with the Wizard DNA clean up kit  Promega  Fitchburg  Wisconsin  United States  in TE  X   mM Tris HCl and   mM EDTA  pH   
Aliquots of viral DNA preparations were digested by restriction enzymes corresponding either to marker a  b  c  or d and submitted to a   agarose gel electrophoresis  colored by ethydium bromide and exposed to UV 
Each individual restriction enzyme cut once in Cabb S DNA and twice in Mark S  thus generating DNA fragments of different sizes attributable to one or the other in the mixed population of CaMV genomes 
After scanning the agarose gels  we estimated the relative frequency of the two genotypes in each viral DNA preparation and at each marker position  by densitometry using the NIH   Image program 
The statistical analyses of the frequency of the four markers are described below To identify and quantify the recombinants within the CaMV mixed populations  aliquots from ten of the   viral DNA preparations described above were digested by the restriction enzyme SalI  and directly cloned into pUC  at the corresponding site 
In each of the ten viral populations analyzed    full genome length clones were digested separately by BsiWI  PstI  MluI  and SacI  to test for the presence of marker a  b  c  and d  respectively 
In this experiment  with the marker representing an additional restriction site  we could easily distinguish between the Cabb S and the Mark S genotype at all four marker positions  upon agarose gel   electrophoresis of the digested clones 
Clones with none or all four markers were parental genotypes  whereas clones harboring     or   markers were clearly recombinants 
Due to the very high number of recombinants detected  markers eventually appearing or disappearing due to spontaneous mutations were neglected Here we present the different methods we used to quantify recombination in the CaMV genome 
Because all these methods assume that the different markers are neutral  we first discuss assumption We used two datasets to test the neutrality of markers  both resulting from plants co infected with a   ratio of Mark S and Cabb S 
The first consisted of viral DNA densitometry data derived from   plants  described above  where for each plant we have an estimate of the frequency of each marker in the genome population 
The second consisted of the restriction of   individual full genome length viral clones obtained from one co infected plant  described above  yielding an estimate of the frequency of each marker  and this was repeated on ten different plants 
The frequencies of the different markers were       and   for markers a  b  c  and d in the first dataset and       and   in the second dataset 
We tested whether these frequencies were significantly different from the expected value under neutrality    using either t tests  for datasets where normality could not be rejected  seven out of eight cases  or Wilcoxon signed rank non parametric tests otherwise  marker c in the first dataset 
In all cases p values were larger than  There are several cautionary remarks regarding these analyses 
First  in all cases we found an excess of markers 
Unfortunately  the two datasets cannot be regarded as independent because  even though the methods through which the frequency estimates were obtained were different  the plants used in the second dataset were a subset of the plants of the first 
We thus have only four independent estimates in each case  and there is minimal power to detect significant deviations from neutrality with such a small sample size 
It should be noted at this stage that deviations from the expected value could also be caused either by slight deviations from the   ratio in the infecting mixed solution  or by deviations from that ratio in the frequency of the viral particles that actually get into the plants 
Second  because of the relatively small sample sizes and low statistical power  the tests presented above could have detected only large deviations The results clearly show  however  precisely that the markers do not have large effects  if any  and that therefore recombination estimates would be affected only very slightly by any hypothetical selective effects of the markers 
Because of this  along with the fact that the introduced markers provoke silent substitutions in the CaMV genome  we assumed that markers were effectively neutral in the rest of the analysis The dataset used to estimate the recombination frequency consisted of the   full genome length viral clones   from each of ten co infected plants  individually genotyped for each of the four markers 
As discussed in detail in the Results  recombination was very frequent and concerned all four markers 
Indeed  approximately half of the genotyped clones exhibited a recombinant genotype 
It was therefore meaningful to try to obtain quantitative estimates of recombination from our data Our aim was to analyze viral recombination in a live host 
Consequently  we had to deal with the fact that more than one viral replication cycle occurred during the   d that infection lasted in our experiment  we had to wait that long for the disease to develop and to be able to recover sufficient amounts of viral DNA from each infection 
Based on the kinetics of gene expression    we postulate that each replication cycle lasts between   and   d  and that therefore seven to ten cycles occurred between infection and the sampling time 
In case this assumption is incorrect  we did calculations assuming five  seven  ten  or   replication cycles during these   d  As shown  the results were not affected qualitatively  and only slightly quantitatively 
It is important to note that we assumed that recombination occurred through a template switching mechanism  and that therefore  from a recombination point of view  the CaMV genome is linear 
The reverse transcription starts and finishes at the position   in Figure   which is the point of circularization of the DNA genome 
This implies that changes between contiguous markers a–b  b–c  and c–d can be considered as true recombination whereas those between a and d cannot  as they may simply stem from circularization of DNA  during the synthesis of which the polymerase has switched template once anywhere between a–b  b–c  or c–d To estimate the recombination rate between markers  we wrote recurrence equations describing the change in frequency of each genotype over one generation  assuming random mating and no selection  i e  the standard Wright–Fisher population genetics model 
We then expressed the frequency of all possible genotypes n generations later as a function of their initial frequency and of the recombination parameters 
Subsequently we calculated the maximum likelihood estimates of the recombination parameters and their asymptotic variances given initial frequencies  we assumed that the two  parental  genotypes  Mark S and Cabb S  had equal initial frequencies of   and that all other genotypes had initial frequencies of zero  and frequencies after n generations  the observed frequencies  as stated above we used different values of n 
All algebraic and numerical calculations were carried out with the software Mathematica The recombination parameters are the recombination rates between two adjacent loci  e g  r
  for the recombination rate between markers a and b  and the interference coefficients  e g  i
  for interference between recombination events in the segments between markers a and b and b and c  To define these parameters we followed Christiansen    and in particular the recombination distributions for two  three  and four loci  respectively  Tables     and   of   
It is important to realize that given the definitions of these parameters  the estimator of the recombination rate between two loci is not affected by the number of loci considered 
In other words  we obtain the same estimation of the recombination rate between markers a and b whether we consider genotypic frequencies at just these two loci  or the frequencies at these two loci plus a third locus  or the complete information to which we have access  the four marker genotypes 
Information on additional loci only affects the estimates of the interference coefficients It proved impossible to carry out the calculations for four loci algebraically 
Instead  we used a computer program to calculate the expected genotypic frequencies at all four loci after n generations  given the above stated initial frequencies and specified recombination parameters 
For each combination of recombination parameters we calculated a Euclidean distance between the vector of the expected genotypic frequencies and the observed genotypic frequencies  and considered that the estimated recombination parameters were those yielding the minimal Euclidean distance 
In all cases  the estimated recombination rates between pairs of loci were equal to the second decimal to those estimated algebraically from data for three or two loci Tumor Restrictions to Oncolytic VirusIn most solid tumors the tumor interior displays a high cellular density with multiple cell types  both malignant and normal  stromal  cells  interdigitated by strands of extracellular matrix  ECM  and other poorly defined tissue 
Stromal cells typically consist of fibroblasts  macrophages  neutrophils and other immune cell types 
Tumor associated fibroblasts are a source of the bulk acellular tissue in tumors    which is largely made up of polysugars and glycoproteins  such as collagens  laminins  fibronectins  proteoglycans  hyaluronan and water  forming a dense matrix around and between the cancer cells   
This matrix provides structural support but also haptotactic and chemotactic guidance for cancer cells   
Moreover  the prevailing tumor interstitium is rich in soluble angiogenic factors  such as members of the vascular endothelial growth factor  VEGF  family    cellular growth factors  including endothelial growth factor  EGF  basic fibroblast growth factor  FGF  platelet derived growth factor  PDGF  and pleiotrophic factors  particularly transforming growth factor  TGF  beta   
Additionally  both tumor  and stromal cells secrete cytokines and chemokines  such as interleukin  IL    IL   tumor necrosis factor  TNF  alpha  stromal cell derived factor  SDF    macrophage migration inhibitory factor  MIF    which on one hand recruit more stromal and progenitor cells into the tumors and on the other hand curb the activity of antigen presenting cells and anti tumor T cells   
In several independent cancer types  high serum levels of IL   and IL   are indicators of poor prognosis   Aberrant tumor and stromal growth combined with an overproduction of matrix leads to high interstitial pressure in the tumor  preventing lateral diffusion of therapeutic compounds within the tumor 
Tight cellular compactness combined with a high tumor proliferation rate also causes physical crowding and puts constraints on oxygenation  which due to aberrant angiogenesis and rupture of the haphazard vessels is mostly incomplete and results in chronic tissue hypoxia toward the tumor cores 
As cancer cells exist in a crowding hypoxic  and cytokine growth factor perpetuated chronic state of stress  they upregulate a number of key cellular molecules that function as a collective defense against a wide range of therapies  including oncolytic viruses 
The properties of oncolytic viruses and their status in clinical development as well as various delivery options have been reviewed elsewhere   
In this review  we provide an overview of two of the main intratumoral barriers to oncolytic virus spread  the extracellular tumor make up and the intracellular antiviral defense mechanisms Tumor cellular structure and composition may in concert with abundant extracellular matrix  ECM  deposition pose a severe hurdle for systemic virus entry and propagation of infection within the tumor 
The extracellular matrix is a complex dense network consisting of multiple proteins  glycoproteins and polysaccharides including collagens  laminins  fibronectins  proteoglycans and hyaluronic acid   
The interstitial fluid pressure  IFP  in the tumor surrounding blood and lymphatic vessels is mainly created by the high cell density that forms an increased physical pressure outwards and does not allow free diffusion of therapeutics   
A high IFP generally predicts an aggressive tumor phenotype as tumor cells tend to escape from tumor margins where the pressure drops  thus facilitating spread of metastatic cells   
On the other hand  for therapeutic virus  interstitial fluid concentration gradients may pose a hurdle as passive diffusion in viable regions  typically the rim  may occur mainly outward   
Given the limited arsenal of known chemicals alleviating tumor compactness and the poor penetration drugs in general into the tumor tissue  this is a considerable problem that may not be easy to tackle 
Some strategies are discussed below Viruses are passive particles and rely either on radial cell to cell spread or on soluble diffusion across concentration gradients to reach their target cells and to propagate the infection 
Tumor matrix is critical in this regard  as it can block both forms of spread 
Passively diffusing viruses may physically not fit through the strands of the ECM 
This was shown for oncolytic herpes virus  which has an outer diameter of over   nm  and whose spreading could be improved by matrix degrading bacterial collagenase co injection   
Bilbao and coworkers showed that adenovirus entry into experimental hepatocellular carcinoma nodules in the livers of immunocompetent rats following intravenous or intraportal injection was directly related to the thickness of the ECM capsule enveloping the nodules   
On the other hand  we found using Semliki Forest virus  which has an outer diameter of about   nm  that even upon intratumoral injection spread was blocked by ECM  which formed a physical barrier for virus infection  Figure  The foremost option to reduce interstitial fluid pressure and to remove physical molecule barriers imposed by the ECM is to use matrix degrading enzymes 
These act by digesting collagen  fibrin  and other types of fibrillar matrix deposits  creating more space between cell clusters  and glycosaminoglycan polymers  known to limit fluid movement in tumors 
Simultaneously  such strategies may also expose more cell surface to viruses  increasing the likelihood of infection 
In a study by Kuriyama  trypsin or collagenase dispase was injected into subcutaneous U  and U  glioma xenografts in immunocompromised mice  followed by a reporter adenovirus   
Both types of ECM degrading enzymes increased tumor transduction by the virus  but when doses got too high  transduction efficacy suffered  demonstrating a balance between ECM degradation and oncolytic virus efficacy 
In another study  treatment of PC  tumors with vaccinia virus producing matrix metalloprotease  MMP    resulted in reduction of collagen IV fibrils and increase in virus penetration into tumor  which yielded elevated virus titers   
Hong et al 
targeted orthotopic neuroblastoma xenografts engineered to express MMP  with oncolytic HSV  achieving increased virus distribution compared to control tumors   
Similar results were obtained when human soft tissue sarcoma HSTS T overexpressing MMP  or MMP  were injected with oncolytic HSV   
MMP expressing tumors contained significantly less sulfated glycosaminoglycans compared to control tumors 
Other enzymes and protein effectors  either engineered into virus expression cassettes or provided exogenously  include hyaluronidase  decorin  various other MMPs  and notably relaxin a peptide hormone normally expressed during particular phase of pregnancy that does not possess tissue degrading activity itself  but instead induces a number of key collagen degrading proteases seemingly in a tumor specific manner   
Beyer showed that relaxin expressed by murine stem cells improved trastuzumab penetrance and therapy outcome in syngeneic tumor models   
In another study  chimeric adenovirus Ad  expressing relaxin showed increased tumor transduction and virus dissemination   Several other strategies to increase penetration of therapeutics in tumors have been developed   
While the stromal ECM capsule of tumor nodules acts as a physical barrier to virus entry following intravenous injection  it was possible to improve tumor infection by administering vaso active compounds  angiotensin II  histamine  nitroglycerine  before the virus   
This is interesting  as vasculature per se would not be expected to alter or influence the physical composition of the ECM  such as collagen strand thickness 
Instead  virus access to the tumor was improved  most likely by increased access from the blood via tumor stromal adjoining vessels 
Interestingly  in a study with oncolytic herpes virus  anti VEGF monoclonal antibody Bevacizumab given before intravenous virus injection gave poorer anti tumor efficacy than when given after the virus   
The study showed that while HSV is able to enter and infect tumors better through their leaky vasculature compared to Bevacizumab normalized vasculature  vascular normalization by Bevacizumab still gave superior combination efficacy when the virus was already in the tumor 
This effect was likely dependent on altering both physical and biological properties of the tumor  including interstitial pressure and oxygenation 
In another study  anti VEGF A antibody injections in nude mice harboring U  human glioma xenografts led to an increase in MMP  expression and reduction in collagen fiber content  facilitating improved distribution of oncolytic adenovirus within the tumor tissue   
In general  targeting tumor vasculature by oncolytic viruses and including agents that affect tumor vasculature in combination regimens is gaining interest    and it will be interesting to see more specific studies on how vascular acting agents may affect the physical barriers to oncolytic viruses Some viruses do not need an extracellular step for propagating infection  such as members of the herpes and poxvirus families  and may be able to spread from cell to cell 
For example  HSV  is able to infect neighboring cells via lateral tight junctions in a manner dependent on its glycoproteins E and I   
Vaccinia virus  on the other hand  induces so called actin tails  which are actin filament driven membranous protrusions of the plasma membrane harboring a single virus particle at the outer tip 
These actin tails actively deliver and deposit virus particles onto or even into neighboring cells   
Because lateral spread without an extracellular step may circumvent neutralizing immunity as well as some of the physical obstacles the tumor microenvironment imposes  this ability has been engineered into viruses that normally do not possess it 
A promising strategy is to engineer OVs to express membrane fusogenic genes  MFGs  such as gibbon ape leukemia virus  GALV  glycoprotein  reptilian reovirus p  protein  FAST  or the membrane glycoproteins H and F of measles virus   
Quite intriguingly  expression of several different MFGs by oncolytic adenovirus synergized with chemotherapy in anti tumor efficacy both in vitro and in vivo    suggesting that membrane fusion facilitated lateral spread of also chemotherapeutics  which otherwise would not have occurred in a compact tumor 
The potential limitation of cell to cell dependent spread  however  may be that membrane free physical barriers  such as the ECM  may still pose a barrier to spread 
Also  it is unclear whether MFGs or other mechanisms of lateral spread may assist in reaching distant tumor nests Some other strategies to alleviate matrix imposed restrictions to oncolytic viruses have been discussed elsewhere   Tumors of epithelial origin mostly retain the firm cellular integrity seen in their original adhesive intercellular configuration 
Several viruses use cellular receptors which are located in paracellular tight junctions  which may be problematic in tightly packed tumors   
Adenovirus C group viruses use coxsackie adenovirus receptor  CAR  as their primary entry point  whereas adenovirus B  group members and measles virus Edmonston use CD  complement binding molecule as their cellular receptor   
Adenovirus B  group  serotypes       and   entry occurs using desmoglein   DSG    
Of these  CAR and DSG  are preferentially located within tight junctions and are hidden from virus binding   
Also the complement receptor CD  was ascribed a role in maintenance of epithelial cell integrity by interactions with the E cadherin catenin network   
These observations imply that before reaching the potential entry site on the tumor cell the virus must find its way into the junctional space 
Moreover  it has become increasingly clear that for example glioma tumors traditionally targeted by Ad  serotype adenoviruses often express only low levels of CAR and instead much higher levels of CD    Beyond that tight junctions hide multiple virus receptors  they contain a network of adhesion molecules  including ZO  cadherins  claudins and occludin  which  if perturbed  is associated with more aggressive disease in many types of cancer   
Since tight junctions also contain important receptors that mediate tumor promoting signaling and which have been targeted by monoclonal antibodies  notably Her  it would be highly useful to develop strategies that temporarily loosen the tight junction contacts even at cost of a transient increase in tumor metastatic risk 
One of the most interesting approaches has been to exploit the natural propensity of adenovirus serotype   which as part of its natural life cycle creates dodecahedral particles  PtDd  consisting of viral capsid proteins  penton base and fiber that open tight junctions by binding to and dissolving desmoglein  dimers and reducing E cadherin expression  to develop a specific tight junction opening molecule  JO    
Adenovirus type   uses PtDds to promote its own infection  opening the tight junctions ahead of infection to maximize access to desmoglein 
Analogously  when administered to human tumor xenografts  JO  facilitated penetration of trastuzumab much deeper into the tumor tissue than when the monoclonal antibody was administered on its own   
Moreover  JO  synergized with several chemotherapeutics in solid tumor models   
Backed by our own findings with oncolytic SFV  showing that both extracellular matrix and tumor cell compactness restrict virus spread and oncolytic efficacy  we believe combination approaches that target both tight junctions and extracellular matrix will prove effective in future virotherapy development  Figure  An alternative approach to increasing tumor penetration by oncolytic viruses is to alter tumor cell morphology and status 
Notably  cell death and in particular the type of cell death induced by virus has been shown to affect virus distribution within a tumor mass  in a study by Nagano et al  administration of apoptosis inducing paclitaxel before injecting oncolytic herpes simplex virus increased virus dissemination in the tumor  allowing its diffuse in  tunnels  created by shrinking dying tumor cells   Maintenance of physiological adherence is essential for proper ECM function and for retaining cellular integrity 
Therefore  a potential caveat of using ECM degrading proteolytic enzymes or tight junction openers is the risk of neoplastic cell detachment from the tumor ECM and increased risk of metastasis 
While ECM degradation or tight junction opening may operate innocuously  there is also a chance that loss of E cadherins via proteases or via non specific deregulation of tight junction integrity during ECM modulating therapy could trigger pro tumorigenic Wnt β catenin signaling  possibly driving epithelial to mesenchymal transition   
One study showed that ectopic relaxin expression stimulated MMP expression and enhanced breast cancer invasiveness    whereas another paper found short term relaxin exposure to increase breast cancer cell motility whereas long term expression reduced both motility and cancer invasiveness   
In the context of oncolytic viruses  Lavilla Alonso tested several proteases  including hyaluronidase  relaxin  and macrophage metalloelastase  and showed they all could assist adenovirus entry into tumors  yet  the authors did not detect treatment induced metastases or increase in tumor invasiveness   
Another strategy possibly balancing some of the putative risks of tight junction disruption could be to use Wnt dependent oncolytic viruses   Tumors are invariably fenestrated by host fibroblasts  myeloid cells and other non transformed cells  which driven by cancer induced cues can adopt various reprogrammed phenotypes to promote tumor angiogenesis and growth and to alter tumor responses to therapies   
As most of them normally play a role in immune homeostasis and pathogen sensing  they also respond to and influence oncolytic virus infection of tumors Fulci et al 
reported that injection of oncolytic HSV  directly into glioblastoma tumor parenchyma triggered upregulation of CD  and CD  monocytic markers and rapid clearance of virus  likely executed by infiltrating phagocytic cells   
When clodronate liposomes were used to deplete macrophages in vivo  the authors observed a  fold increase in virus titers in the brain tumors concomitant with an   reduction in peripheral CD  macrophages in animal spleens  suggesting that CD  cells migrate into the tumors upon virus injection and limit overall oncolytic efficacy 
While CD  cells were not reduced by peripheral macrophage depletion  arguing that these cells had been recruited to the tumors before the treatment  they could be eliminated in live glioma slices ex vivo  resulting in a  fold increase in virus replication 
Macrophages may secrete antiviral type I interferon constitutively at very low  subnanomolar  levels   and recently Liu et al 
showed that tumor resident CD  macrophages induced a protective antiviral state in ovarian and breast tumors which led to resistance to oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus  VSV  infection   
Type I IFN signaling  JAK  inhibitor Ruxolitinib reversed the resistance  facilitating VSV replication in the macrophage protected cancer cells 
It is tempting to speculate that tumor resident macrophages also rendered syngeneic GL  and DBT mouse gliomas completely refractory to VA  oncolytic alphavirus  as these cells were quite infectable in vitro and live glioma slices regained their sensitivity to virus within   h  indicating dilution of IFN I   Macrophages or the closely related myeloid suppressor cells are the predominant stromal cell type in many tumors and are actively recruited during cancer progression   
Heavy macrophage presence in the tumors indicates that such tumors may be resistant to oncolytic virotherapy  unless depleting preconditioning would be used 
Moreover  as part of the early immune response to virus infection  monocytic cells are rapidly recruited to tumors following intratumoral virus injection 
In one study  depletion of either CD b  cells or VEGF secreted by these cells in mice treated with oncolytic HSV  greatly increased oncolytic efficacy  tentatively linking pro tumorigenic and antiviral angiogenic mechanisms   Another key pro tumorigenic signaling employed by many tumors is up regulation of CXCR  the receptor for chemokine CXCL   also known as SDF  and recruitment of stromal cells expressing CXCL  which maintain the tumor and recruit additional cells to support tumor expansion and invasion  such as endothelial cell progenitors which contribute to neovascularization   
Indeed  high CXCR  expression is a negative prognostic factor for many cancers 
Oncolytic vaccinia virus engineered to express a soluble antagonist of CXCR  showed improved intratumoral virus replication  increased vascular disruption and a markedly reduced infiltration of the tumors by putative immune suppressive and tumor promoting stromal cells   
This study highlights how reducing pro tumor stromal cell effects may alleviate antiviral resistance and yield increased overall therapeutic efficacy 
On the other hand  if the paracrine antiviral effects of tumor homing monocytic cells could be selectively abrogated these cells could favorably be used to ferry oncolytic viruses into tumors 
Indeed  a significant delay in metastatic tumor potential was achieved when macrophages were harnessed to deliver a tumor specific oncolytic adenovirus   What is the antiviral status in human cancer 
Recent analyses from different normal cells that occupy the same organ reveal striking functional variation in components of the type I IFN signaling pathway that correlate with the tissue tropism and virulence of some virus strains   
Can similar variation in such components be found in cancer cells  or do cancer cells make an exception Transformed cells undergo selective elimination by the immune system before becoming cancerous  termed immunoediting  based on observations of differential capacity of immunocompetent mice to reject tumors previously grown in immunocompromised hosts versus syngeneic animals   
Cancer cell responsiveness to type I and type II IFNs plays a role during immunoediting  cancer cells that eventually progress to form a tumor display reduced capacity to respond to IFN gamma  which otherwise would upregulate MHC class I molecules and render the tumors amenable to CD  T cell mediated destruction  whereas responsiveness to type I interferon initially helps tumors avoid immune purging during the editing phase and is then irrelevant   
Of note  the anti tumor effects of type I IFN  still exploited today in several cancers  were shown to depend on host NK cells  and mice in which IFNAR was blocked by monoclonal antibody failed to reject even highly immunogenic tumors  as opposed to mice treated with control antibody  who all rejected the immunogenic tumor challenge   
Thus  whereas tumor responsiveness to type I IFN is not predetermined after immunoediting  other factors post immunoediting may influence it In several tumor types  varying levels of expression of components of the type I IFN signaling cascade have been detected  and in some tumor types these components have been found to have prognostic value  whereas in others they do not seem to influence survival   
However  emerging data suggests that antiviral genes may predict poor survival because they increase treatment resistance 
In one study  poor prognosis of several types of cancer due to genotoxic treatment resistance was found to correlate with increased activity of IFN I pathway genes   
In this study  a triad of type I IFN signaling pathway genes  STAT  ISG  and IFIT  formed a pan tumor type negative prognostic factor  and a broader seven gene cluster established negative prognostic criteria for treatment resistant breast cancer 
Treatment resistance was subsequently shown to depend on STAT  signaling  STAT expressing tumor clones were positively selected in animals in vivo  demonstrating increased proliferation and metastatic potential  and STAT expression mediated resistance against genotoxic assault by doxorubicin or ionizing radiation  knockdown of STAT  resulted in lower proliferation rate and metastatic capacity and increased sensitivity to genotoxic stress    
In another study  resistance to epigenetic DNA modifiers  AZA dC  a methyltransferase inhibitor  and LBH  or MGCD  both histone deacetylase  HDAC  inhibitors  was correlated with increased expression of IFN I pathway genes in small lung cancer cells   
Basal IFN related gene expression in several different SML cell lines was upregulated Interestingly  in many cancers  STAT proteins are not phosphorylated and persist in unphosphorylated form  U STAT 
Like its phosphorylated counterpart  U STAT  increases expression of genes contributing to resistance to DNA damaging agents   
While it is currently unknown why cancers may prefer to use unphosphorylated forms  it is known that U STATs activate distinct signals compared to their phosphorylated counterparts 
However  importantly for oncolytic viruses  in many tumors  constant expression and release of type I IFN leads to a constitutively high level of unphosphorylated forms of STAT  STAT  and IRF  which together form an unphosphorylated but functional ISGF like complex that relocalizes to the nucleus and drives expression of a specific set of ISGs distinct from acute IFN I exposure   
These ISGs are sufficient to maintain a functional antiviral defense and they play a critical role in resistance to DNA damaging agents On a cellular level  virus replication is controlled by antiviral defense molecules    which in turn are primarily controlled by type I IFN signaling 
In addition to classical type I IFN  or cytokine induced antiviral signaling  tumors may employ other antiviral defense mechanisms 
For example  stromal cells may secrete peptides with antiviral properties called defensins   
The defensins are amphiphatic and typically  –  amino acids in length and interfere with viruses by physically binding to and disrupting virus particles and or by inducing antiviral responses in target cells via pattern recognition receptors 
At least oral squamous cell carcinomas were found to overexpress defensins compared to normal control tissues   
While the role of defensins in oncolytic virus infection of tumors is unclear  one study showed that the immune stimulating properties of defensins may be exploited to increase overall therapeutic efficacy 
In this study  expression of beta   defensin from a conditionally replicating adenovirus yielded a superior therapeutic entity compared to the unarmed parental virus via enhanced anti tumor immune responses mediated by TLR dependent activation of dendritic cells   In summary  human cancers display varying degrees of expression of antiviral proteins or their signaling regulators at baseline 
Some of these may increase in response to genotoxic anti cancer treatments 
In the next chapter we will highlight some of the consequences to oncolytic virotherapy of the heterogeneity in type I IFN responsiveness in tumor cells All oncolytic viruses tested to date display variable infectivity in different cancer cell lines 
This variability is likely at least partly dependent on type I IFN as most oncolytic viruses are IFN sensitive 
IFN secretion follows virus sensing by the cells via Toll like receptors expressed on both the plasma membrane and in endocytotic vesicles  NOD like receptors  STING  AIM  NLP inflammosome and other danger sensing molecules  summarized elsewhere   
While all viruses carry an arsenal of counteracting molecules    no virus goes completely undetected 
Even HSV amplicons  which are devoid of functional virus genes  induce a type I IFN response that mediates a STAT dependent system wide antiviral defense in mice within one hour of intravenous vector injection  resulting in significant reduction of transgene expression compared to expression in STAT  knockout animals   During our own studies with attenuated SFV vector VA  it became apparent that the dramatic and lasting therapeutic efficacy achieved following mere single intravenous  or intratumoral  injection of the virus in immunocompromised mice bearing human A  melanoma or U  glioma xenografts   was not going to be recapitulated easily in immunocompetent animals   
The paradox in our studies was that while oncolytic SFV vector VA  effectively replicated in and destroyed a variety of IFN responsive cancer cell lines in vitro  it consistently failed to eradicate tumors generated from the same cell types in vivo  even if large doses of virus were injected directly into the tumor mass and even if the tumors were void of visible physical barriers  Figure  
Conversely  only tumors generated from IFN unresponsive cancer cells have seemed infectable in vivo by VA  so far 
In light of earlier findings by others  showing that type I IFN receptor knockout mice are highly susceptible to SFV infection and quickly succumb to multi organ systemic infection    the parameters for oncolytic SFV efficacy seem clear  tumor cells must be defective in type I IFN response for the virus to be effective These findings are in line with emerging data from other groups  showing a remarkably strict dependence of oncolytic virus replication on defective type I IFN responsiveness  a dogma introduced at the turn of the  st century   
For example  sarcomas and melanomas display differing permissiveness to oncolytic VSV  an obstacle which may be overcome by blocking type I IFN signaling   
In eight sarcoma cell lines  basal up regulation of RIG I and IFIT  and rapid induction of STAT  phosphorylation upon IFN I treatment correlated with resistance to oncolytic measles virus   
In other studies  human pancreatic and ovarian cancer cells display resistance against Rb dependent oncolytic adenovirus  strongly correlating with intracellular levels of MxA  and acquired resistance to repeated oncolytic adenovirus injections in an intraperitoneal ovarian carcinoma model was associated with an increase in MxA as well as several other key ISGs in the tumors   
A study comparing normal human or mouse melanocytes to a panel of melanoma cells revealed strong correlation between permissiveness to oncolytic VSV and capacity to mount antiviral defense in response to type I IFN   
In this study  VSV rp  harboring two mutations in P and L genes  was superior to several other tested oncolytic VSV strains  but the dependence on defective IFN responsiveness was still retained 
In yet another study  oncolytic VSV replicated in four out of twelve mesothelioma cell lines which were unable to mount antiviral defense upon IFN beta pretreatment or to respond to infection by up regulation of PKR  MxA or  OAS mRNA   
In contrast  the non permissive mesothelioma cells mounted antiviral defense  associated with PKR  MxA or  OAS mRNA up regulation  in response to infection or to exogenous type I IFN 
The authors of this study further linked the observed pattern of virus resistance to clinical mesothelioma samples  where in a mesothelioma tissue array  significant variance in immunoreactivity against PKR  p  and or IFNAR was observed  with only a few samples displaying lack of reactivity against all three components  arguing that most tumors in clinical settings would display at least some level of resistance to oncolytic VSV Oncolytic adenoviruses are often deleted for E A  which normally binds Rb and prevents it from sequestering E F  which results in the viruses being unable to replicate in normal cells 
However  since adenovirus  as with all viruses  contains elements that antagonize antiviral defenses  such elements have also been targets for deletion to render the virus sensitive to innate antiviral defenses  which would be expected to remain intact only in normal cells 
Cancer cells expressing Ras may down regulate protein kinase R and inhibit type I IFN induction by interfering with RIG I signaling   
Also  select interferon stimulated genes appear to be repressed by the Ras MEK ERK signaling cascade   
PKR activation shuts down E F dependent translation  including translation of virus messenger RNAs 
Therefore  an adenovirus deleted for VA RNA  which antagonizes PKR  should be capable of replicating in Ras overexpressing  tumor  cells 
However  while this was seemingly the case    it was later discovered that Ras is not an obligatory determinant for PKR inactivation and that virus replication was halted even in Ras overexpressing cells via functional PKR mediated E F phosphorylation  implying that the parameters of VA RNA deleted adenovirus replication had to be revised   
Similar findings were obtained with oncolytic reovirus  against which Ras independent tumor resistance emerged in vivo   
Thus  under some circumstances even tumor cells over expressing Ras may respond to type I IFN or to stimulants of pattern recognition receptors  activating PKR and inhibiting virus translation 
To complicate matters  MEK inhibitors have been shown restore antiviral signaling capacity in Ras overexpressing tumors   
This implies that human tumors treated with MEK inhibitors  such as Trametinib which was recently approved for treatment of BRAF mutated melanoma  may be poor targets for oncolytic viruses as antiviral signaling capacity in such tumors may be restored Some oncolytic viruses  such as members of the poxvirus family  are seemingly resistant to the antiviral effects of type I IFNs in vitro and may be controlled by other cellular factors   
However  in most cases  sensitivity or resistance to type I IFN is assessed in vitro and using only one cytokine  which may mask synergies with other factors present in vivo 
One possible explanation for the in vitro–in vivo discrepancy is the tumor micro environment  which not only imposes physical barriers to oncolytic viruses but also alters intracellular antiviral defenses 
For example  glioma cells were found in the brain to spontaneously secrete type I IFN  which conferred resistance against oncolytic HSV 
Resistance was linked to ECM protein CCN  interaction with glioma cell surface receptor alpha   beta   integrin  which activated interferon secretion   
It is tempting to speculate whether this or a similar ECM glioma interaction could have contributed to the resistance of syngeneic glioma cells we observed in vivo but not in vitro to both oncolytic SFV and vaccinia virus  FIG    
Also  while critical in many respects  antiviral signaling may occur without signaling via type I IFN receptor  IFNAR 
For instance  upon infection of IFNAR KO mice with murine hepatitis virus  MHV  brain cells were found to have upregulated antiviral GTPase TGTP and IFITm  and IFITm  all of which have confirmed antiviral activity in vivo against a variety of viruses   
In these cases  IFN gamma and TNF alpha likely account for at least part of the observed ISG activity  where e g  TGTP is upregulated by IFN γ signaling and TNFα has been shown to induce ISG  independently of IFNAR   Interestingly  while most cancers are heterogeneous in antiviral defence signaling  one broad class of tumors in particular may display consistently low capacity to ward off oncolytic viruses  oncovirus induced cancers 
This is because oncoviruses  as all viruses  carry a complement of factors that abrogate antiviral sensors and effectors  which may result in tumors that are uniformly devoid of antiviral signaling 
In an intriguing study  oncolytic VSV infected and destroyed human papilloma virus  HPV positive cervical carcinoma cells more effectively than HPV negative head  and neck cancer cells due to HPV E mediated suppression of antiviral signaling   
HPV positive or E expressing xenografts were efficiently eradicated from nude mice following VSV injection 
The potential of this approach is that even oncolytic viruses that are extremely sensitive to type I IFN  such as attenuated SFV or M mutated VSV  may function well against oncovirus induced cancers where the oncovirus machinery ensures the lack of antiviral defense While on first thought it would appear counterintuitive to antagonize the very factors that keep oncolytic viruses tumor specific  emerging data shows that this can be accomplished in a safe way 
One of the foremost strategies to increase oncolytic virus efficacy is to combine them with drugs that lower tumor antiviral defenses 
In this regard  a primary target for interference is the prototypical type I IFN signaling cascade 
While small molecular inhibitors against IFNAR are not available  activity of downstream signaling transducers may effectively be blocked 
Human pancreatic cancer cells were shown to constitutively express high levels of MxA and OAS and to mount type I IFN dependent resistance to oncolytic VSV 
Resistance could be overcome by blocking activity of IFNAR associated Janus kinase  JAK      
Similarly  JAK  inhibitor ruxolitinib overcame type I IFN dependent resistance of human SCC  head and neck cancer cells against oncolytic VSV   
Ruxolitinib also successfully abrogated type I IFN mediated antiviral effects elicited by macrophages    highlighting that this drug might also alleviate type I IFN dependent tumor resistance to oncolytic viruses imposed by stromal cells 
However  the obvious downside to using JAK inhibitors is their effects on critical host defense mechanisms  which may result in increased infection of normal cells 
Moreover  JAK inhibitors may reduce anti tumor immune responses elicited by oncolytic virotherapy 
For example  ruxolitinib was shown to impair the capacity of dendritic cells promote CD  T cell responses against model tumor antigens   
On the other hand  in this study clearance of adenovirus was delayed in ruxolitinib treated normal animals  which makes it difficult to predict the overall impact of JAK inhibitors on tumor therapy where prolonged virus presence might translate to better therapeutic efficacy 
Also  while the immune stimulating and anti tumor effects of type I and type II interferons may be adversely affected by JAK inhibitors  central tumor promoting cascades mediated by JAKs  such as IL STAT  may also be inhibited    yielding a difficult to predict net therapeutic outcome 
At the moment  more studies are needed to establish the overall impact of interference with JAK  signaling in cancer therapy Spurred by earlier reports of oncovirus reactivation and promoter enhancement by histone deacetylase  HDAC  inhibitors  this class of agents was assessed for capacity to enhance oncolytic virus potency by inhibiting antiviral responses 
Indeed  such enhancement was observed with oncolytic VSV and SFV  and while it has been difficult to pinpoint the exact mechanisms that underlie HDAC inhibitor enhancement of oncolytic virus replication in cancer cells  antiviral defenses in general are inhibited for yet unknown reasons mainly in cancer cells and not in normal cells  which indirectly facilitates virus replication   
Interestingly  combination of HDAC inhibitors with conditionally replicating   E A deleted adenovirus gave improved virus replication rate and therapeutic efficacy in subcutaneous xenograft models only when the inhibitors were given before the virus  otherwise inhibition of replication was observed   
Similarly  HDAC inhibitors increased replication and oncolytic efficacy of HSV when given before the virus but not when given at the same time   
With nuclear DNA viruses  such as adenovirus and HSV  it is possible that HDAC inhibitors also alter virus genome accessibility to transcription factors  resulting in reduced replication or other adverse effects  implying that with these viruses HDAC inhibitors should be administered before the viruses Recently  it was found that HDAC inhibitor vorinostat activates NfκB signaling by facilitating hyperacetylation of the p  subunit  which in turn activates cellular autophagy   
Autophagy was in another study shown to be important for VSV replication  presumably by inhibiting antiviral signaling 
This is interesting  as a previous study revealed enhancement of VSV replication by inhibiting TNF alpha induced antiviral signaling mediated by p  using NfκB inhibitors BMS  or TPCA    
In this study  neither inhibitor had an effect on STAT  or STAT  phosphorylation or their nuclear relocalization in response to type I IFN but the authors observed clear induction of ISG  GBP  and MX  in response to type I IFN in U  glioma cells  with the latter two being dependent on NfκB signaling 
Taken together  NfκB pathway activation may result in different antiviral responses in different cancer types  and inhibition or enhancement of oncolytic viruses by NfκB inhibitors is dependent on other concomitant cellular mechanisms  such as autophagy Since HDAC inhibitors modulate promoter activity accessibility  it is conceivable other epigenetic or promoter modifying agents could work in a similar manner to repress antiviral defense induction and enhance oncolytic viruses   
DNA demethylating agents  azacytidine  Aza  and decitabine synergized with oncolytic herpes simplex type   virus in glioma models in vitro and in vivo  as did HDAC inhibitor valproic acid  VPA  which was already shown before to work well with oncolytic HSV as well as several other oncolytic viruses   
Moreover  inhibition of cancer antiviral defenses  specifically RNAseL and PKR  resulted when cancer cells were exposed to sunitinib  a multi tyrosine kinase inhibitor originally developed as an inhibitor of VEGF R and PDGF R signaling  yielding strong anti tumor synergy with IFN sensitive oncolytic VSV   
Since sunitinib is approved for renal cell carcinoma and imatinib resistant gastric cancers  combination with oncolytic VSV constitutes a promising and clinically relevant approach warranting further investigation 
Interstingly  sunitinib as well as several other receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors displayed antiviral effects against polyomavirus BK    arguing that these compounds are not universal virus enhancers Cyclophosphamide  CPA  is a general immunosuppressant used to minimize Treg presence during immunotherapy and also oncolytic virotherapy 
CPA may  however  also enhance replication and efficacy of oncolytic viruses by diminishing cytokine secretion by stromal cells  including type I IFN   
Another compound enhancing oncolytic virus efficacy by lowering cell responsiveness to type I IFN is triptolide  which acts downstream of IRF  activation   
Further  the kinase mammalian target of rapamycin  mTOR  enhances the antiviral effects of type I IFN by activation of its effector proteins  E BP  which binds and inactivates translation factor eIF E  and S K  which carries out cell type specific signaling functions of type I IFN  such as activation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor  B and promotion of ISG  transcription 
Consequently  rapamycin was able to enhance oncolytic VSV replication and anti tumor efficacy by inhibiting type I IFN mediated antiviral signaling via mTOR   Several other compounds synergizing with oncolytic viruses have been identified via high throughput drug library screening  many of which seem to act by antagonizing antiviral defenses 
For instance  a novel virus sensitizer  Vse  was found to greatly diminish antiviral effects of type I IFN against oncolytic VSV in several cancer cell types  and the drug also synergized with the virus in subcutaneous mouse tumor models   
For many of these new compounds  the mechanism of action is still poorly understood  necessitating extensive safety studies to exclude undesirable effects against normal cells Apart from classical type I IFN induced antiviral defenses  which typically prevent virus translation and degrade virus genomes  other cellular machineries regulate oncolytic virus efficacy 
Notably  strategies to increase cancer cell death in response to oncolytic viruses have been tested 
In a recent study  a class of compounds called SMAC mimetics synergized in several cancer models with oncolytic VSV by removing cancer cell block to apoptosis in response to virus induced type I IFN  TNF α or TRAIL   
Interestingly  since virus infection triggered cytokines act on nearby non infected cells  SMAC mimetics may in combination with oncolytic viruses also cause significant bystander tumor destruction 
Normal cells are not affected by the IFN SMAC mimetic synergy  providing an important safety aspect 
In another study  blocking the ER stress response circuitry triggered by oncolytic rhabdovirus infection by a small molecular inhibitor of serine threonine protein kinase and endoribonuclease IRE α  which was identified in a genome wide siRNA screen  greatly enhanced cytotoxicity via caspase induced apoptosis and increased oncolytic efficacy in refractory tumor models in mice   
This effect was independent on induction or responsiveness to type I IFN 
Conversely  inhibitors of nucleoside transporter   ENT  were discovered from a high throughput screen of enhancers of oncolytic HSV  and to date such inhibitors have not been reported to alter cellular antiviral responses   
Other compounds  such as common chemotherapeutics  and their mechanisms synergizing with oncolytic viruses have been discussed elsewhere for most of them the possible role of antiviral defense antagonism in enhancing oncolytic virus efficacy remains to be studied   Thus  many compounds are available to interfere with tumor antiviral defenses 
The outstanding question for most of them  however  seems to be why such compounds do not render normal cells sensitive to oncolytic viruses 
Elucidation of the exact mechanisms of action and the differences between normal and cancer cells constitute a worthy goal for studies in the near future Already in the  s it became clear that using certain pathogenic wildtype viruses  such as West Nile virus and Bunyamwera virus  in cancer patients would result in off target toxicity   
Characteristic for pathogenic viruses is a greater ability to circumvent or antagonize cellular innate antiviral defenses than attenuated strains 
For example  unlike the prototypical oncolytic reovirus strain type   Dearing  the T L strain of reovirus causes accumulation of IRF  in the nucleus and inhibits activation of a select group of ISGs yet because of this property the T L strain is myocarditic unlike the oncolytic type   Dearing strain   
For these reasons  many oncolytic viruses used today  such as reovirus type   Dearing  oncolytic strains of Newcastle disease virus and M mutated VSV have either a stronger capacity to induce or a weaker capacity to resist antiviral type I IFN than the corresponding wildtype strains   An open question  however  is whether strain specific or virus specific differences that relate to specific components of the cellular antiviral machinery may be exploited for greater anti tumor efficacy  i e  if one virus fails  could another be used in its stead 
While Ras expression was critical for oncolytic reovirus replication in cells overexpressing CUG  oncogene  oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus was unable to replicate in the same cells due to increased activation of STAT  and OASL    
Thus  in these cells reovirus was not affected by STAT  or OASL  and it therefore remains interesting to see which other antiviral effectors may have been lacking in the CUG expressing cells and  conversely  how reovirus and VSV differ in terms of sensitivity to antiviral effectors 
While several oncolytic viruses have been compared to each other in terms of replication rate and cytotoxicity  systematic studies with regard to tumor antiviral defenses have not been conducted As any attenuated virus is likely to replicate effectively only in its own niche  i e  to be restricted by a specific set of ISGs  and as wild type strains may be too toxic for use in humans  a compromise may be achieved by incorporating select elements from wild type viruses into oncolytic virus backbones 
Indeed  several chimeric and recombinant viruses have been generated that harbor specific elements of wild type strains or even of other unrelated viruses in order to better resist cancer antiviral defenses  Table  
As an example of introducing wild type elements into attenuated viruses  Haralambieva reported on a measles virus Edmonston vaccine strain in which P gene was replaced with the counterpart from the wild type IC B strain   
Later  Meng et al 
included N  P  and L genes from wild type measles in Edmonston backbone  producing an enhanced but still safe oncolytic virus   
Edmonston vaccine virus induces a more robust IFN response compared to wild type measles virus partly due to the weaker ability of V protein to suppress MDA mediated activation of IRF  and IFN I induction   
In vivo  P gene encoded proteins  particularly V  control the quality of the cytokine response to measles so that vaccine strains qualitatively induce a stronger inflammatory response compared to WT strains  where WT V protein suppresses multiple cytokine secretion 
V protein short cytoplasmic tail has been shown to bind and inactivate STAT  IRF  MDA  and the Rel homology domain of the NfκB subunit p  but not of p    
Also  V causes LGP  protein to bind and inactivate RIG I    but it seemingly does not interfere with TICAM   TRIF  multiple TLR adaptor  including TLR mediated IFN β induction 
Thus  if cancer and normal cells would differ with regard to TICAM  or IRF  then such a virus could potentially target specifically cancer cells rather than normal cells 
So far  the measles Edmonston WT chimeras have proven safe in animals As an example of heterologous virus constructs  lentogenic Newcastle disease virus engineered to express influenza virus PR   H N  NS  showed enhanced oncolytic efficacy in vivo due to dampening of antiviral responses   
While such a virus did not display enhanced pathogenicity in that study  a mesogenic NDV virus harboring NS  from influenza strain H N  did show increased pathogenicity in chickens as well as an increased ability to replicate in human cells    raising some cautionary warnings for future engineering of similar replicative viruses 
As another example  vaccinia virus soluble type I IFN scavenger B R  NOTE  B R is often used in the literature  has been engineered into both oncolytic HSV and oncolytic rhabdoviruses  resulting in all cases in more effective therapy agents without loss of tumor specificity   
Oncolytic γ  gene deleted HSV was complemented by two different PKR antagonists from human cytomegalovirus  TRS  and IRS  generating a chimera capable of reaching wild type virus replication levels in cancer cells in vitro and in tumor models in vivo   The selection of various viral IFN I antagonists that potentially could be used to augment attenuated oncolytic viruses is vast   
For example  increased replication of several viruses  including HIV  Sindbis virus and E deleted adenovirus in mammalian cells was observed when the cells were engineered to express vaccinia virus E L protein  influenza A virus NS  protein  ebola virus VP  protein or HIV  Tat protein   
The choice of antagonist must primarily be made with safety in mind  but virus specific and cell specific differences in antagonist functions may potentially be exploited rationally when considering the overall combination 
For example  vaccinia virus E L is able to rescue VSV but not EMCV from exogenous IFN  whereas vaccinia virus K L partially rescued EMCV but not VSV   In anticipation of systematic  perhaps bioinformatically guided   super chimera  studies  two or more viruses that may complement each other s shortcomings in antiviral defense antagonism have been considered 
Notably  vaccinia virus was favorably combined with IFN I sensitive oncolytic VSV and SFV  yielding tumor model dependent increases in overall therapy efficacy that were dependent on vaccinia virus antagonism of type I IFN responses  which increased the replication of the IFN sensitive viruses   
Such heterologous virotherapy approaches may also be used to generate immunological synergy  similar to heterologous prime boost vaccination  anti tumor immune responses may be increased due to targeting of the tumor by two different viruses  on two separate occasions  but anti virus immune responses would be generated against different viruses each time  avoiding the problem of neutralizing immunity to and predominance of antivirus immune responses   
Some other ideas explored experimentally include engineering oncolytic viruses to express other oncolytic viruses 
For example  the entire oncolytic parvovirus H  genome was placed under a regulatable promoter in oncolytic adenovirus  resulting in a more effective therapeutic entity than either virus alone without loss of tumor specificity   
The genetic material of Semliki Forest virus replicons has been engineered into adenovirus and vaccinia virus backbones   and several other virus chimeras have been constructed   
However  the effects on tumor antiviral defenses of such a constructs remain to be studied The attribute  oncolytic  implies for a virus that it infects and  indeed  lyses the infected tumor 
This property is primarily tested in vitro in cultured tumor cells 
We have learned  however  that in the native tumor microenvironment in living hosts many viruses are no longer able to infect tumor cells or to kill them even if they manage to infect them 
Tightly packed tumor cells and the network of supportive molecules of the extracellular matrix form a physical barrier to virus particle diffusion 
It has also become evident that the tumor cells themselves may be much more capable of thwarting oncolytic virus advances than previously thought  with some tumor cells residing in a seemingly permanent non permissive antiviral state 
Tumors harbor multiple cell types in addition to the neoplastic cells  which may promote and propagate both physical and cellular virus resistance 
As the efficacy of virotherapy in human cancer patients still falls shy of the achievements in animal models  it appears quite plausible that one or more of the barriers described in this review indeed constitute a real and formidable obstacle for oncolytic virus advancement into routine clinical use 
Fortunately  some of the most difficult barriers have been identified  and a rapidly expanding arsenal of countermeasures is at our disposal 
Our task is now to separate the wheat from the chaff and to systematically evaluate the proposed combination regimens that will yield the best results without compromising patient safety Evidence of prenatal toxicity of herbal based indigenous formulations for sex selection in rat modelsTraditional or indigenous preparations  IPs  are getting considerable attention in global health debates  It continues to be used widely in several countries and its consumption is rapidly increasing 
 
  Many reports have documented the use of such preparations 
For instance  in China  traditional herbal medicines played a critical role during the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome  SARS  In fact  many drugs in modern medicine had their roots in the traditional system of medicine 
Drugs like Penicillin  from Penicillium fungi  and Digoxin  from Digitalis purpurea  are some such examples 
One of the promising therapies for Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus  MRSA  infection is a ninth century treatment for eye infections which is a recipe consisting of garlic and onions  wine  and bile from a cow s stomach brewed in a brass cauldron 
It is however important to note that culture specific practices are not always safe 
Digitalis is a classic example where herbalists use this plant in allopathic treatment strategies  while in some countries such as Britain  law restricts their vast availability  A report from Australia describes the adverse effects of ‘herbal  preparations or IPs  Problems arise when people do not report about the consumption of such preparations assuming that these are devoid of any side effects by virtue of them being natural products  The need for research in this field is huge and scientific research into the quality  safety  molecular effects and clinical efficacy is crucial 
 
 
Pregnancy is considered a time of minimal intervention  and a period when herbal medicines are usually contraindicated  It is reported that many women consume indigenous medicines  that contains Bryonia laciniosa  Quercus infectoria and Putranjiva roxburghii along with other ingredients  during early pregnancy to beget a male child in India 
These preparations  often called sex selection drugs  SSD  contain herbal ingredients but these are off the label prescriptions and hence cannot be certified as ‘herbal  medicines 
The prevalence of consumption varies from   to as high as         Studies have indicated that there is  –  times higher risk of birth defects including major malformations of internal organs like urogenital and renal malformation  trachea esophageal fistula  and visible defects like spina bifida  cleft lip palate and imperforate anus 
 
  Risk of stillbirths also increases   folds 
Studies suggest that a single exposure during pregnancy can be deleterious 
 
 
 
  SSDs are reported to contain phytoestrogens  steroids and heavy metals 
 
 
 
  It is also known that although placenta serves as a barrier  most drugs and environmental chemicals enter the foetal circulation by passive diffusion or active transport  However  despite growing evidence on deleterious effects of these herbal formulations  few studies have attempted to systematically understand the risk of such preparations using animal models 
Genetic sex of a child is determined at the time of conception by the fertilization of the ovum with X or Y sperms and intake of so called preparations for sex selection can never alter that In view of these  the current study was conducted with an objective to determine the embryo foetal and development toxicity of SSDs following maternal exposure during critical period of organogenesis using a small animal model The study was guided by the OECD guidelines for testing of chemicals  Guideline no    adopted on  nd January   Prenatal Developmental Toxicity Study  and was based on a mutually approved protocol 
Personal protection equipment was employed as required while handling the test system The test facility is registered and renewed  No 
 PO RcBi S CPCSEA dated July     for breeding and to conduct research on animals for commercial purpose by the committee for the purpose of control and supervision of experiments on animals  CPCSEA  Ministry of Environment  Forests and Climate Change  Government of India 
The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee  Venus Medicine Research Center 
Due permission was taken from the Ethics Committee of Indian Institute of Public Health Delhi For this experiment  strain of Sprague Dawley of rats  Rattus norvegicus  was used 
The number of dams per group was   instead of   as laid down under OECD guidelines 
Rats of both sexes  –  g  were obtained from National Institute of Biologicals  India at  –  weeks of age  acclimatized for five days and then subjected to the experiment at  –  weeks of age 
They were housed in standard polypropylene rat cages with stainless steel top grill  one dam per cage  at a temperature of       °C  with  –  relative humidity 
Bedding material and cages were changed once in six days and   hourly light dark cycle was followed 
Animals were identified by their existing ear numbering 
Cages were labelled by tags indicating the study number  sex  group of the animals  experimental start and completion dates 
Standard pelleted feed  from Ashirwad Industries  Mohali  India  was provided ad libitum to all the animals 
They also had free access to purified water via drinking bottles throughout the study 
The feed  cages and drinking bottles were not analysed for the presence of phytoestrogens and bisphenol A 
However  similar materials were used for all the rats across all groups The drug comprised of IPs for sex selection  SSD 
These non branded locally made preparations are made available  –  days after placing an order and are never sold openly 
These preparations essentially contain herbal ingredients such as Shivlingi  Bryonia laciniosa  Majuphal  Quercus infectoria  Putrajeevak  Putranjiva roxburghii  Nagkesar  Mesua ferrea  and feather of peacock  Pavo cristatus 
A total of   such samples of SSDs were procured from varied sources like ‘pansari  shop owners  grocers  local alternative medicine practitioners  rickshaw pullers  drivers and commoners from different states 
SSDs are advised to be consumed between   and   weeks of pregnancy The samples were categorized into   groups based on redundancy of the preparations and common ingredients reported 
This was followed by chemical analysis in an accredited laboratory to detect the presence of phytoestrogens and steroids 
Since we explored the toxic effects of these preparations we wanted to select two samples that would be most predictive of toxicity 
Due to resource constraints  we did not want to subject all the   samples for animal study 
Hence  three samples of SSDs  found to be most rich in phenols and steroids were selected for toxicity study  All the three samples were also tested for heavy metals which suggested that Lead and Mercury were in very high quantities  The toxicity was examined using C  elegans  an alternate animal model 
Survival analysis and reproductive toxicity was assessed from the brood size and progeny count assay  The two SSDs that were found to be most toxic were selected as test items for the subsequent study in rat models 
SSD   was reported to contain Shivlingi and Putrajeevak while SSD   contained Shivlingi  Majuphal  Putrajeevak  Nagkesar and feathers of peacock 
Both the samples were obtained from grocers 
Local preparations like these are bound to have certain degree of variability in concentrations but more often than not  these remain the major ingredients According to studies reported  women consume such preparations along with cow s milk in dosages and schedule that are quite varied 
While some advise these IPs to be consumed for one day  others prescribe it for   days  to be taken thrice a day 
We considered the amount of SSDs most commonly reported by pregnant women  weighing   kg  which was  –  g daily for   days 
The dose of the test item   mg kg  was calculated by using conversion factor of  Conversion factor is the ratio of the correction factors  estimated by dividing the average body weight in kgs of species by the body surface area in m  of the species  Km 
Human equivalent dose  HED in mg kg    Animal dose  mg kg  X correction factor  Km animal Km human 
Kms of every species are constant 
For humans it is    assuming average weight of adults to be   kg a surface area of   m  and for rats it is  Therefore  HED   mg  kg    animal dose X  
Or  animal dose         mg kg           mg kg Since pregnant women consume these orally  these were administered to rats by oral route The test items were coded as SSD   and SSD   and were provided to the experimental laboratory  Venus Medicine Research Center  Baddi  in powder form 
On the day of dosing  the doses were administered between  –  h  The test items were administered in fresh cow s milk at a final volume of   ml kg 
The doses were calculated on the basis of the latest body weight recorded for the study 
A stainless steel gavage cannula fitted to a calibrated syringe was used for dosing the animals For control animals  cow s milk was used as a vehicle while feeding The study was performed in two phases to evaluate the effect of SSD consumption duration during gestation period Adult  nulliparous female rats were mated with males of same species and strain in  
Each morning  dams were examined for the presence of a vaginal plug and vaginal smear was taken from each dam by using pipette smear technique 
The day of vaginal plug formation or sperms observed in vaginal smear  also known as successful mating  were considered as GD   Gestation day  
The mated females were housed individually in clear polycarbonate cages with stainless steel wire lids 
Mating process was carried out to result in   pregnant animals per group 
Successfully mated females were randomized into control and treatment groups 
All the rats were sacrificed on GD  
According to OECD guidelines  the test chemical should be administered daily from implantation to the day prior to scheduled caesarean section in order to assess toxicity 
Test chemicals were administered to pregnant animals and sacrificed as per the schedule  which was as close as possible to the normal day of delivery without risking loss of data resulting from early delivery i e GD  
The females were killed  before caesarean section  the uterine contents were examined  and the fetuses were evaluated for soft tissue and skeletal changes The pregnant rats were randomized to two intervention and one control groups 
SSD was given during pre implantation to implantation stage  GD  – 
Each group of rats was treated either with vehicle  G  VC  SSD   G    mg kg  or SSD   G    mg kg SSDs were given from GD  –

Cage side observations for clinical signs of toxicity in the animals were recorded once daily until the day before necropsy •Body weight  Body weight of all experimental animals were recorded once before mating  initial body weight  and then after confirmation of mating 
Body weights were recorded on days               and on terminal day before sacrifice 
These recorded body weights were used for calculating the dose volume to be administered •Food consumption  Food consumption was evaluated once after successful mating or on day   of gestation  the day of vaginal plug formation or sperms observed in vaginal smear  and on days             and one day prior to sacrifice 
Calculated amount of feed were placed in the trough of each cage and the quantity of feed remaining after approximately   h were weighed and recorded •Morbidity Mortality  All the animals were observed twice daily  once in the morning between   and   h and once in the evening between   and   h  for incidence of morbidity and or mortality •Maternal examination related parameters  At the end of the observation period  all the dams were sequentially euthanized  by CO  asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation  and subjected to gross necropsy 
After termination  dams were examined macroscopically for any structural abnormalities or pathological changes 
Blinding was done while evaluation of the dams during caesarean section and subsequent foetal analyses to minimize bias 
Pregnancy rate was calculated as the proportion of mated pairs that had produced at least one pregnancy within a fixed period where pregnancy was determined by the earliest available evidence that fertilization has occurred 
Gestation index was calculated to indicate number of females with live born as a proportion of number of females with evidence of pregnancy •Examination of uterine contents  Immediately after termination  the uteri were removed and the pregnancy status of the animals ascertained 
Gravid uteri including the cervix were weighed  and number of corpora lutea were determined 
The uterine contents were examined for numbers of embryonic or foetal deaths and live foetuses 
The degree of resorption was described in order to estimate the relative time of death of the conceptus 
Any increase in the number of resorption and or implantation loss is an indicator of litter size for the individual dam •Examination of foetuses  The sex and weight of each foetus were determined 
Approximately one half of each litter were prepared and examined for skeletal alterations from selected dams 
The remainder were prepared and examined for soft tissue alterations  using accepted or appropriate serial sectioning methods or careful gross dissection techniques 
Each foetus was examined for external alterations 
Foetuses were examined for skeletal alterations  using Alizarin Red S staining method 
The fetuses for skeletal staining were kept in pre labelled plastic containers containing   ethanol before staining 
After skinning  we processed the foetus for staining by immersing in   alcian blue   GX for three days  then performed rehydration through a gradient series of ethanol   ethanol   –  h twice    ethanol   –  h  ethanol   –  h  distilled water until the samples sank to the bottom of a conical tube 
Samples were further treated with   KOH for  –  days or until it became clear and again treated with   alizarin red for next  –  days until bones became purple 
Samples were rinsed   times in   KOH  for  –  h at each time point 
Samples were further treated with a gradient series of glycerol  KOH    h   glycerol   h X  Visceral examination was done by micro dissection technique 
Fetuses were preserved in   formalin until they became fixed 
An illuminated magnifier was used for visceral examination 
We placed the foetus in a supine position on a paraffin wax block tray covered with paraffin wax  secured the fetal limbs by paper pins to the paraffin wax block  made a ventral midline incision from the umbilicus  cutting caudally to the genital tubercle and cranially to the diaphragm 
Once incision was completed  we located the ventral attachment of the diaphragm and lifted the liver carefully to examine the diaphragm for abnormal opening 
After observation  the diaphragm was clipped 
We gave a longitudinal cut to open the rib cage slightly lateral to and on the right of the sternebrae and then extended the cut anteriorly to neck region 
The rib cage was opened gently and secured to the paraffin block petridish tray with pins Foetuses were examined for soft tissue alterations  e g 
variations and malformations or anomalies  using Wilson s Technique 
The fetal viscera were examined sequentially  beginning with thoracic organs and moving caudally 
We performed hearts cuts after completion of other observations 
We examined the bilobed thymus for size  shape  coloration and presence of haemorrhages and then removed it for observation of trachea and esophagus 
We observed the lungs for size  color and number of lobes  observed the trachea  esophagus for normal alignment and presence of fistula  opened the pericardial sac and cut off pericardium to expose the heart for observation 
We checked the size  shape  color of the heart and normal development of major blood vessels 
After observation of thoracic viscera  we observed the abdominal viscera and liver for size  shape  color  texture  and number of lobes 
External anatomy of heart was examined by making two incisions using micro dissecting scissors We examined the stomach  spleen  pancreas  small and large intestines for size  position or any other developmental anomalies 
The intestines were moved aside after observation for seeing the underlying structures 
Ureters were checked for normal size and location and for continuity from the renal hilus to the urinary bladder 
One kidney was cut transversely and another was longitudinally to examine renal papilla and renal pelvis 
To confirm the sex of the foetus  the gonads were inspected carefully 
We examined the reproductive organs for size  shape and location GraphPad Prism® statistical software version   was used to analyze the data and all the results were represented as mean   S E M 
Intergroup variance for most of the parameters was calculated by one way analysis of variance  ANOVA  followed by Tukey s test 
A value of p     was regarded statistically significant 
Linear regression was performed to examine the weight change of dams during pregnancy for each group comparing with the control after adjusting for the litter size 
The malformations were analysed by performing Chi square test for trend for two groups  SSD  G  G  G  G  and SSD  G  G  G  G The ARRIVE guidelines were followed to report the findings 
In phase   pre natal study  all the dams dosed with SSD  and SSD  had normal food intake and weight gain 
The average gain in weight from GD  to GD   was       gms for controls while it was       gms in SSD   and       gms in SSD 
 Webtable  
No test item related mortality or clinical sign of toxicity was encountered during the study 
All dams in treatment groups and control group survived to scheduled terminal sacrifice 
They showed normal behaviour until euthanized 
There were no differences in mean maternal body weights  body weight gains  pregnancy rate  gestational index  pre and post implantation loss  and resorptions 
No significant differences were observed in foetal sex ratio  foetal body weights 
However  one dam from SSD  had all male foetuses 
No abnormality was detected in skeletal and visceral examination In phase   controls and SSD  and SSD  treated dams exhibited a comparable food intake  Table  
 
However  a dose response relationship was observed with reduced weight gain with higher doses of SSDs 
 Table  
 
Two dams  one in G   SSD    mg kg  and the other in G   SSD    mg kg  categories showed decreased or consistent body weight GD  onwards 
On an average  the weight on GD   was       gms in controls while it was       with SSD    mg kg  and       gms with SSD    mg kg 
The adjusted analysis indicated that except in G  there was a significant reduction in weight gain in all the intervention groups as compared to the control group after controlling for litter size  Table  
 During follow up  one dam from SSD    mg kg  and one from SSD    mg kg  showed haematuria during gestational day  – 
However  no another clinical sign of toxicity was encountered during the study 
All the dams in treatment and control groups showed normal behaviour and survived to scheduled terminal sacrifice 
In phase   pregnancy rate and gestational index were found to be   at all dose levels with SSD  whereas  in SSD  it decreased to   in G   SSD    mg kg  and G   SSD    mg kg  groups 
One dam from G   SSD    mg kg  and another one from G   SSD    mg kg  group showed mating confirmation during vaginal smear examination and showed positive sign in initial days of pregnancy but during necropsy on expected day of delivery  GD   no foetus was found 
Body weights of dams increased in the initial stages that became constant at a later period 
To reconfirm it  non gravid uterus was stained in salewski strain and presence of conceptus was found 
This indicated the possibility of miscarriage Increased pre and post implantation losses as well as resorptions and reduced live foetuses were observed with both SSD  and SSD 
No significant differences were observed in foetal sex ratio  but decreased foetal body weights were noted in both sexes 
On an average one early resorption in a group was a normal observation 
More than one late resorption was observed in all treatment groups while there was none in the control group 
Total count of live foetuses count was significantly reduced with SSD  and SSD  treatment in a dose dependent manner 
Total number of live foetuses were reduced up to   in SSD  at   mg kg treatment group and   in SSD  at   mg kg treatment group Both SSD  and SSD s at different dose levels showed decreased fetal weight in dose dependent manner  although the difference was not significant 
Skeletal and soft tissue alterations were observed in both treatment groups 
In general  the embryo–foetal examination showed abnormalities  which could have caused some functional damage to these foetuses if allowed to grow in the normal course 
In visceral examinations  slight dilation of the renal pelvis  reduced papilla size  urinary bladder hypertrophy was observed in few foetuses from both SSD  and SSD  treatment groups 
Few incidences of foetal soft tissue abnormalities encountered in this study were normal variants 
Skeletal examination showed variations in the ossification patterns like incomplete or poorly ossified skulls  ossification of sternebra  cleavage ossification of thoracic centrum  asymmetric thoracic centrum  and supernumerary rib in many foetuses in SSD  and SSD  groups  Table  
 
A trend was noted with increased incidence of certain malformations with increasing dosages of SSDs that was statistically significant for most malformations with SSD The results of this developmental toxicity study suggest that administration of SSDs to pregnant rats had significant impact on intrauterine foetal growth  early and late resorption as well as developmental anomalies 
These formulations have teratogenic potential but does not affect sex ratio IPs contain phytoestrogens like diadzein and genistein  In vitro rat whole embryo culture assay  WEC  studies of genistein in rats have indicated fetotoxic and teratogenic potential at concentration of ≥  μg mL  However  in vivo  an oral  gavage  embryonic and fetal development pilot study could not demonstrate any teratogenic effect in the same study 
These findings are different from our study probably because we used SSDs containing natural herbal and non herbal ingredients unlike those studies where synthetic genistein was used 
In both the studies  decreased body weight was observed indicating slight maternal toxicity 
Food consumption was unaffected in our study which is contrary to what was reported 
In another study  pregnant rats exposed to oral isoflavones  diadzein and genistein in varying combinations  showed alterations in the number of live foetuses  lysed foetuses  number of resorption sites  and implantation sites while no clinical signs suggestive of maternal toxicity  seizures  tremors and salivation  that was observed similar to our study 
Maternal mass gain was significantly reduced in rats treated with   mg kg of isoflavones  Ratio of females to males in the litter of different groups was similar akin to our finding  These observations clearly nullify the claim that consumption of SDDs could alter the sex of the growing foetus 
An analysis done by the same authors earlier revealed that SSDs contain testosterone and steroids 
 
  The prenatal testosterone in pregnancy is known to affect sexual development adversely      The principles of reproductive biology state that the genetic sex of an individual is determined at the time of conception and can never be altered under any circumstances 
However  phenotypic sex of the growing foetus is likely to be influenced by the hormonal milieu of in utero environment 
Our analysis was confined to phenotypic sex only and hence it is difficult to state if any differences existed with reference to genetic and phenotypic sex 
This requires further inquiry Evidence on the effects of SSDs on humans should best be obtained from human beings 
The findings of the current study corroborate well with the evidence generated from observational studies in human beings      Presence of skeletal and visceral malformations could explain why stillbirths are likely to be more in women who consume SSDs 
The dosing of the test drugs was intended not only to examine the period of organogenesis solely but to assess effects from preimplantation  through the entire period of gestation to the day before caesarean section 
The results were based on observations of more than   female animals with implantation sites at necropsy that added to its strength 
Unnecessary handling of pregnant animals as well as any stressors from outside was avoided 
At least three dose levels and a concurrent vehicle control were used with dams randomly allocated to different treatment groups that support the validity of the results 
However  absence of   rats per group does not support it to be a fully OECD compliant study 
We did follow the principles of Good Laboratory Practices  GLP  but due to constraints of resources the study could not be conducted as a GLP compliant study  though this is optimal for academic interests There is a lack of systematic approach to assess the safety and effectiveness of herbal preparations 
Ingredients for herbal medicines are often drawn from different sources and are used in combination  which may exhibit variability in terms of species  growing conditions  and biologically active constituents 
To isolate each active ingredient from each herb and then to establish its toxicity is time consuming  resource intensive and not practical 
Moreover  drug approval process does not accommodate undifferentiated mixtures  Though important  it surpasses the herb herb interaction and the potentiating effect of one compound over another 
Therefore  in our study  we administered the herbal mixture to assess the effects 
Real time evaluations have yielded important observations for several herbal drugs especially related to pregnancy 
For instance  Wang et al 
  used mice model to evaluate the adverse pregnancy outcomes after maternal exposure to the herbal medicines  particularly during early pregnancy  The major events included maternal and perinatal mortality 
Maternal weight gain  embryo growth and post natal weight gain were significantly decreased 
Moreover  foetal resorption and skeletal malformations were increased  signifying potential toxicity of Chinese herbal medicines 
This is comparable to our findings To conclude  the results of this developmental toxicity study suggest that administration of SSD  and SSD  to pregnant rats exerted significant impact on intrauterine foetal growth and development without any effect on sex ratio when administered during the period of organogenesis 
The prenatal exposure of SSD  and SSD  at dosage level of   mg kg day and   mg kg day during gestational days  –  to female rats had demonstrable effect on maternal or embryo foetal toxicity and teratogenicity SBN and AG conceptualized the study  AS and DD developed the study protocol and conducted the experiment  analysed the data and interpreted the findings

It is therefore natural to expect that the distribution of amino acids  across all protein sequences  would appear to be fixed  given no mutations over a specific period of time 
Of the   naturally occurring amino acids  each seems to appear randomly located at a particular position within the sequence of a protein 
However  when the sequences of a group of proteins are compared to one another  specific patterns begin to emerge 
These patterns are commonly referred to as motifs and frequently produce similar structural elements and in many cases  similar functions between the proteins that contain them 
In recent years  significant efforts have been made to reduce sequences into discrete motifs  so that each can be linked to some specific biological function based on particular rules      
Databases that consist of identifiable amino acid motifs  such as PROSITE  Pratt and EMOTIF  have been constructed to allow researchers an easy classification of unknown proteins into families based on their common motifs               
All of these methods share one property  they depend on specific alignment algorithms  such as the basic local alignment search tool  BLAST or PSI BLAST  to perform the sequence comparison between diverse families of proteins being analyzed      
These methods have already led to a number of key discoveries and offer the promise of determining biologically meaningful information about function from a protein s primary sequence It is generally accepted that a strong correlation exists between a protein s amino acid sequence and its resulting structure and function         
Techniques that can quickly determine significant similarities between protein sequences are valuable in predicting an unknown protein s function within the cell 
Here we describe a procedure that  by computing the frequency of key amino acid pairs  can quickly classify large groups of proteins into functional groups 
In order to uncover any relevant amino acid strings  we have utilized statistical methods applicable to datasets with large fluctuations in the search of human protein sequences within both the Swiss Prot and Complete Human Genebank databases The goal of this manuscript is to demonstrate how these two residue motifs can be used to develop rapid methods for searching protein or genomic databases in order to locate potentially interesting or aberrant protein sequences 
As an example  we describe the distribution of select amino acid pairs within the genome of the Coronavirus  Tor  which is responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome  SARS    
We have examined additional sets  but the limited format of this paper precludes a large presentation of potential applications The set of all   naturally occurring  amino acids are described by their standard single letter representations  and are taken as the complete set contained within all protein sequences as shown below Zq A R N D C Q E G H I L K M F P S T W Y V Residues that are arranged in a certain order can be referred to as vectors and are represented symbolically as b n b b bn bj Zq The coordinates of each vector represent the amino acid symbols contained within any given protein  where n is the total length of the vector 
The collection of all vectors b n  in the proteome can therefore be denoted simply by Zq n The underlying structure of a protein sequence  which is the order of the amino acids  has unique and identifiable characteristics 
As an analogy  in written English  the letter q is almost always followed by u 
Also  the frequency of the word  and  is much higher than that of the related three letter strings   nad   nda   dan  and  dna  which are simply permutations of the same set of individual letters to construct a word with a different meaning 
Utilizing similar characteristics  we can intuitively scan for unique sequence vectors contained within any given protein 
We expand on these characteristics  by utilizing the concepts of affinity and order stability in Section  Using the entire Swiss Prot database  release number   as the basis for our calculations  we have constructed a probability table for the occurrence of the   naturally occurring amino acids  see Table  
    
In addition to the Swiss Prot database  we have also included data from Complete Human Genebank  NCBI Build Number   March    as a source for all characterized and hypothetical human protein sequences We use the symbol Ω to denote the Swiss Prot database  and the letter M to denote the number of proteins in the database  
Hence we can state that Ω As s M  where As a a as Ns  is the sth protein  ai with i Zq is the ith amino acid in the sequence  and Ns is the length of the protein sequence As 
For any vector b n  if there is a sequence As in Ω such that b n  is a segment of As  then we can say b n  occurs in Ω 
We can then use NΩ b n  to denote the total number of outcomes that b n  has occurred in Ω  and let NΩ n  be the total number of all vectors occurring in Ω with length n  Therefore p b n NΩ b n NΩ n is the probability that the vector b n  occurs in Ω 
We then introduce k p q b n log p b n q b n where p b n  and q b n  are any two probability distributions on Zq n  and b n  belongs to Zq n 
The quantity k p q b n  in Eq 
  is defined for any two probability distributions p b n  and q b n  on Zq n  where the distribution q arises from independent letter  i e  amino acid  probabilities 
Then  k p q b n  can be viewed as a random variable about b n  and its probability distribution is defined as follows F p q x PI k p q b n ⩽x b n k p q b n ⩽xp b n The expectation value μ p q  and variance σ p q  of p b n  are expressed mathematically as μ p q b n Zq n p b n k p q b n 
 σ p q b n Zq n p b n k p q b n μ p q  Hence we see that μ p q  is simply the Kullback–Leibler entropy   
As a consequence  μ p q  is always non negative and μ p q  if and only if p b n q b n 
As a result  the amino acid sequence of b n  can be represented by k p q b n In Eq 
  the probability distributions p  q in the k p q b n  have several possible values 
For example  if we let p be the probability of b n  and only change the value of q in k p q b n  we obtain the following expression q b n j np bj p b p b p bn Based on Eqs 
  and   the value of k p q b n  gives us the affinity for all amino acids within vector b n 
Here two situations are identified as especially interesting i When k p q b n  implies that among the amino acids in vector b n  there is an increased affinity 
That is  the vector b n  occurs more frequently than expected 
 ii When k p q b n  implies that among the amino acids in vector b n  there is a decreased affinity 
That is  the vector b n  occurs less frequently than expected In a similar approach to the condition described above  we may choose q b n p πn b n  where πn b n  is a permutation of b n  and πn denotes a permutation transform 
In this case  the order sensitivity of b n  can also be reflected by the value of k p q b n  and produces the following outcomes i when k p q b n  implies that b n  occurs much more often than πn b n ii when k p q b n  implies that πn b n  occurs much more often than b n In addition to the concepts of affinity and order sensitivity  we can also design other analysis techniques by choosing alternate representations of q b n 
Quantifying the terms k p q b n  we can represent vector frequency numerically 
In cases where k p q b n μ p q ⩾ σ p q  the corresponding vector b n  is called  positive  while in those cases where the opposite takes place  k p q b n μ p q ⩽ σ p q  the vector b n  is called  negative 
By judiciously choosing a   equal to   we obtained   two residue  positive pairs  and   two residue negative pairs  see Table  
  out of a total of   possibilities of amino acid pairs Using any one of the positive motifs from Table   we can develop a test method to detect changes in their distribution through any protein database 
If b b b  is  positive  then p b b μ σp b p b  where p ⋅  is the probability of the amino acids or vectors ⋅ in the database 
Since NΩ μ M Nμ p bj NΩ bj μ MNμ we have NΩ b μ M Nμ μ MNμ μ σp b NΩ b or NΩ b μ M Nμ μ MNμ μ σp b NΩ b and since μ M Nμ is very close to μ MNμfor Swiss Prot database we have NΩ b μ σp b NΩ b and NΩ b μ σp b NΩ b As a consequence of Eq 
  the detection of a deleterious mutation based on the increased appearance of an arbitrary string of these residues becomes possible 
For example  according to Table   CC is an attractive motif with   then NΩ CC μ σp C μ M Nμ μ MNμNΩ C ≈ μ σp C NΩ C Let Ns CC  and Ns C  be the number of CC and the number of C in the sth protein 
Then we have NΩ CC NΩ C  because μ σ  and p C  since NΩ CC s MNs CC NΩ C s MNs C Based upon the result that the CC pair represents a rare event  proteins satisfying Ns CC Ns C  as defined in Eq 
  suddenly become interesting 
We can therefore consider the number Ns CC  as an index to develop detection methods to test for the presence of a CC containing protein within a database 
Using this same reasoning  one can also use any other one of the remaining motifs in Table   to develop detection methods for additional proteins In an identical fashion to the previous example using the positive two residue motifs in Table   we can also use any of the  negative  two residue motifs to develop search methods 
For example  the CM pair is a  negative  two residue  word  with  
That is  p CM μ σp C p M 
Using identical arguments to those described in Section   we obtain NΩ CM NΩ M  and NΩ CM NΩ C 
Since both Ns M  and Ns C  are small numbers for fixed proteins  the overall number of CM pairs in most proteins should be close to zero 
Therefore  we can also use any of the remaining seven  negative  motifs in Table   to develop additional detection methods In contrast to the CC motif  the total number of proteins in the Swiss Prot database having more than one CM pair is quite small 
For example  among the   proteins contained within this database  the number of proteins such that Ns CM ⩾  is   and the number of proteins satisfying the condition Ns CM ⩾  is only  
For human proteins in Swiss Prot  the total number of proteins containing CM pairs is   and there are only   proteins that satisfy Ns CM ⩾   Table  
However  we would expect to find about   proteins having CM pairs in the Swiss Prot database  based upon the amino acid frequencies given in Table   which is greater than the number observed Cysteine rich proteins and the presence of CC pairs in proteins are both concepts that have been studied previously      
If we combine these two concepts and describe them in mathematical terms  we observe that the rates q Ns C Ns and q Ns CC Ns C  describe these two conditions  where Ns  Ns C  and Ns CC  are the numbers of all amino acids  cysteine  and CC  respectively 
We can then derive proteinsNs C Ns p C σ Ns CC Ns C p ξτ C ξτ C σ where σ  and σ  are the standard deviations about Ns C Nss Mand Ns CC Ns C s M respectively We have found the following computational results based on Swiss Prot database σ ≈ σ ≈ andp ξτ C ξτ C ⩾ p C For   we have a much simpler method to determine that a protein sequence is both C  and CC rich if proteinsNs C Ns ∩proteinsNs CC Ns C So  a much simpler method to test whether a protein is a both C  and CC rich for   isNumber of CC  Number of C Number of C  Length of protein Using this principle  we found a total of eight proteins that are both C  and CC rich within the Swiss Prot database For   there is an easier method to determine whether a protein sequence is both C  and CC rich if proteinsNs C Ns ∩proteinsNs CC Ns C So  a much simpler method to test whether a protein is both C  and CC rich for   is based on the inequalitiesNumber of CC  Number of C Number of C  Length of protein Using this principle  we can get a total of   proteins that are both C  and CC rich within the entire Swiss Prot database For   there is also an easier method to determine if a protein sequence is both C  and CC rich sequence when proteinsNs C Ns ∩proteinsNs CC Ns C So  a much simpler method to test whether a protein is both C  and CC rich for   is based on the inequalitiesNumber of CC  Number of C Number of C Length of protein Using this principle  we have identified a total of   proteins that are both C  and CC rich within the Swiss Prot database 
From these results  it becomes clear that there are many C rich proteins and many CC rich proteins that are not mutually inclusive 
The sets of both C  and CC rich proteins are only subsets of the set containing all C rich proteins or that containing all CC rich proteins Because the Swiss Prot database is somewhat biased to those proteins that are of interest to researchers  we have decided to examine a database that was  in essence  complete 
For this  we chose the human subset sequences contained within the Complete Human Genebank database 
This was the most complete and readily available source of human genetic sequences and should therefore provide us with an accurate representation of both CC and CM pair distributions 
We observed that the total number of CC pairs within the human subset of sequences contained in Genebank  a total of   proteins  was  
These pairs were contained within a total of   proteins  Table   a number that is substantially larger than the   we obtained from Swiss Prot data  Table  
Since the total number of amino acids in The Complete Human Genebank is   we can easily get the expected number of CC in Complete Human Genebank is   which is much less than this actual value  
The same also holds true for the CM pair  where we would expect to see   CM pairs  but actually observe    Table  
 
This result is surprising but true and shows that there are fundamental difference between the Human and other species in terms of the frequency of CC and CM pairs To create a single CM pair  it is obvious that one needs only a single C  If a protein sequence also contains a CC pair  the total number of cysteines available to create a CM pair has been reduced by a factor of  
Using the cutoff value of four CC pairs as statistically significant  we determined the probability of finding a CM pair within proteins that already contained a CC pair  Table  
Even though both CC and CM can occur in the same protein  the total number of proteins in Genebank that contain both CC and CM pairs is   and these pairs almost always occur at different locations in the sequence 
However  in some rare cases the second C within the CC pair is shared with the first C within the CM pair  giving us a new triplet CCM If we filter the set of proteins described above for redundant entries  we obtain a set of   unique proteins that contain the CCM triplet in the human proteome 
Using the probability distributions obtained from Swiss Prot  we obtained the probability of CCM as  
Since the total of all protein lengths in the Swiss Prot database is   there should be a total of   CCM triplets 
This value is almost identical to the predicted number of CCM of  
This result suggests that the CCM triplet at least in Swiss Prot occurs randomly 
However  we can also analyze the CCM probability using a different approach  putting q CCM p CC p M  into Eq 
 
If CCM occurs randomly  then we have p CCM p C p C p M  and since p CC μ σp C p C  we will get k p q CCM log p CCM q CCM log p C p CC ⩽ μ σ Based on Eq 
  it is clear that the presence of a CC pair strongly excludes M  Therefore  the probability of the CCM triplet should occur less frequently than that of CC or M individually We have obtained the following statistical results with regard to the total number of CC and CM pairs contained in the Swiss Prot database i The total number of these proteins satisfying Ns CC ⩾  is   and   of these are found in humans 
 ii The total number of human proteins in Ω that satisfy Ns CC ⩾  is  
 iii The total number of the proteins in Ω that satisfy Ns CM ⩾  is     of these are found in humans 
 iv The total number of human proteins in Ω that satisfy Ns CM ⩾  is only  
The genome of the SARS associated Coronavirus contains a total of   open reading frames  which code for six characterized and five uncharacterized proteins   
After examining the complete proteome the SARS associated Coronavirus we observed a statistically significant increase in the occurrence of the CC and CM pairs in the SARS associated Coronavirus  genome Of the   putative proteins  four contain either CC or CM pairs 
Two large poly proteins  GI  and GI  contain   CC and   CM pairs  as well as   CC and   CM pairs  respectively 
The putative spike glycoprotein  GI    contains   CC and   CM  while the small envelope protein  GI    contains only   CC pair 
The remaining   proteins  of which two have been identified as a nucleocapsid and matrix protein  contain no CC or CM pairs 
When compared to the occurrence of CC and CM pairs within all human proteins found in the Swiss Prot database  it becomes clear that there is an increased occurrence of these pairs within the SARS associated Coronavirus proteome It is clear that the frequency of CC and CM pairs is significantly higher in the SARS genome than it is in the human genome 
It is our hope that these unique two residue motifs could be used as a means of identifying a virus such as SARS 
While currently impossible to determine  one can see a possible clinical use for determining the frequency of CC or CM pairs in an individual 
If a person has been infected by SARS  we would expect the numbers of CC and CM pairs to be much higher than in a healthy individual 
If we were then able to develop a clinically feasible technique that could identify the CC or CM pair content in total cellular protein  without damaging the cell  it could be possible to implement a detection method simply by counting the numbers of CC or CM pairs in all proteins examined 
If the presence of increased CC or CM pairs was indicative of infection by SARS we could develop new drugs to inhibit the translation of proteins that contain these pairs within infected cells 
As a very specific example  this could be accomplished through the use of specific tRNA mimics that could block translating ribosome when these pairs appear at the P and A site simultaneously      
While tRNA mimics could normally be seen as non specific protein synthesis inhibitors  the lower frequency of the CC or CM motifs in host proteins as compared to the relatively high occurrence in viral protein provide a starting point for the analysis of treatments using methods such as these In this paper we have performed a detailed search of the Swiss Prot and Complete Human Genebank database in relation to the frequencies of each of the   natural amino acids and motifs made up of two residues 
This has provided us with a new insight into the distribution of proteins within these databases and the information that may be contained within a protein s primary amino acid sequence 
Our focus in this quest has been to examine specific pairs or triplets of residues and use probability theory to assess whether or not particular strings of residues occur more frequently than their probability would indicate 
By analyzing affinity and anti affinity  we developed a procedure to search out all two  and three residue clusters within these databases 
Through this technique  we can rapidly classify large groups of proteins into families based on the occurrence of these motifs 
Combining this concept with a specific knowledge of protein function  we propose novel ideas aimed at developing fast detection methods for specific diseases based on the unusually high occurrence of some of these motifs when compared with the expected probabilities 
A timely example of the application of this method is given  namely the analysis of the SARS virus 
This method will hopefully lead to the discovery of new diagnostic techniques and possible treatment of diseases  by recognizing the location of target domains in the expressed sequence Cell type specific expression of the putative SARS CoV  receptor ACE  in human heartsThe coronavirus disease    COVID  caused by SARS CoV  infections imposes a major threat for the world s healthcare systems and is leading to thousands of deaths 
Angiotensin converting enzyme    ACE  has been identified as a potential receptor for SARS coronavirus  and is also considered the main receptor for SARS CoV  SARS CoV  binds to ACE  via its glycosylated outer membrane spike proteins 
ACE  is highly expressed in the lung and heart  and is known for its vital role in the cardiovascular system –  Although SARS CoV  mainly invades alveolar epithelial cells  it can also cause myocardial injury  as assessed by increased troponin T and NT proBNP levels accompanying increased cardiovascular symptoms in COVID infected patients  It is unclear whether elevated biomarkers of cardiac injury  or long term effects on the cardiovascular system  are directly caused by viral infection of cardiac tissue or are secondary to hypoxia and systemic inflammation 
However  patients with underlying cardiovascular disease represent a significant proportion of the patients who may suffer from a severe course after COVID  infection  This situation may be aggravated by findings showing that ACE inhibitors  which are often used to treat cardiovascular diseases  augment the expression of the SARS CoV  receptor ACE  in lung cells  This is probably mediated by an effect on angiotensin II  which is known to reduce ACE  expression  Thus  ACE inhibition decreases angiotensin II  leading to an indirect up regulation of ACE  The effect of angiotensin II receptor blockers  ARBs  which primarily target the angiotensin receptor   is unclear 
One may speculate that ARBs indirectly reduce ACE  levels by augmenting free angiotensin II levels  which in turn is expected to down regulate ACE  via activating the angiotensin receptor  
However  the effect of the two different treatments on the expression of ACE  in the heart requires further investigation Therefore  we used single nuclei RNA sequencing to determine the expression of ACE and ACE  in the different cell types of the human heart 
Gene expression signatures were detected in cardiac tissues of five patients with aortic stenosis  AS  and two patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction  HFrEF   Figure  A  and compared with with samples of one healthy donor heart  age    years  male  that was not used for transplantation 
After single nuclei RNA sequencing  data were pooled  and unsupervised clustering was performed with a total of     nuclei 
We found   distinct clusters 
Using cell type specific gene markers  major cell types were annotated  including cardiomyocytes  six clusters  fibroblasts  one cluster  endothelial cells  three clusters  leucocytes  two clusters  pericytes  one cluster  and smooth muscle cells  one cluster   Figure  B–D 
ACE  was expressed in cardiomyocytes  Cluster   and   and mural cells  particularly pericytes  Cluster   and was detected at a lower expression level in fibroblasts  endothelial cell  and leucocytes  Figure  D 
Comparison of ACE  in a pooled analysis of nuclei of the different groups showed that ACE  was significantly elevated in cardiomyocytes of patients with heart disease compared with healthy controls  Figure  E 
ACE  was also slightly  but not significantly  increased in endothelial cells  and the expression was lower in fibroblasts of patients with heart disease compared with healthy controls  Figure  E 
Immunostaining confirmed an increased expression of ACE  in cardiomyocytes of patients with aortic stenosis  Figure  F 
In addition  ACE was augmented in cardiomyocytes of patients with AS and HFrEF  Figure  G 
Interestingly  cardiomyocytes of patients who were treated with ACE inhibitors showed a significantly higher ACE  expression compared with ARB treated patients  Figure  H 
Moreover  patients treated with ACE inhibitors had an imbalance of ACE to ACE  expression  with a more than four fold higher ACE ACE  ratio compared with healthy control cells  Figure  I In conclusion  these data provide novel insights into the cell type specific expression and regulation of ACE  in the heart 
Patients with varying heart disease aetiology show augmented expression of ACE  levels particularly in cardiomyocytes 
Treatment with ACE inhibitors tends to be associated with increased ACE  mRNA and unfavourable ACE ACE  ratios  which are believed to be a driver of cardiovascular pathologies  This study is limited by its small sample size and therefore is only hypothesis generating 
However  these novel data suggest that it will be important to monitor SARS CoV infected patients for cardiovascular complications and assess the impact of ARB ACE inhibitor therapy 
Conflict of interest  none declared New onset acute symptomatic seizure and risk factors in coronavirus disease   A retrospective multicenter studyIn December   pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus  later called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus    SARS‐CoV‐  was first reported in Wuhan  China 
On March     the World Health Organization  WHO  declared the syndrome caused by SARS‐CoV‐  infection  coronavirus disease    COVID‐  a pandemic 
According to a WHO Situation Report of April    
 
 there are   confirmed COVID‐  cases and   deaths globally 
COVID‐  affects people of all ages 
 
  
 
 and in severe cases  it may cause dyspnea  hypoxia  acute respiratory distress syndrome  and septic shock 
 
  
 

The current situation has raised concerns regarding whether people with epilepsy have a higher risk to be infected with COVID‐  and whether people would develop acute seizures during the course of COVID‐ 
The objective of this study is to clarify the incidence and the risk of acute symptomatic seizures during acute COVID‐  infections This retrospective multicenter study was approved by the ethics committee of West China Hospital  Sichuan University  approval   
The study was conducted in   officially designed hospitals in Hubei province  the epicenter of the COVID‐  epidemic in China  Sichuan province  and Chongqing municipality 
These hospitals included the East Branch of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University  West China Ward  Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital  and hospitals in Sichuan province designated by the government to treat COVID‐   see the list of hospitals in Appendix S People with COVID‐  who were discharged from or died in the participating hospitals between January   and February     were consecutively enrolled 
All cases were diagnosed according to the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for COVID‐   trial version  
 
 All those enrolled tested positive through nucleic acid detection 
Disease severity was classified as mild  moderate  severe  or critical according to the national guidelines  see Box   for classification criteria 
 
 For our study  we aggregated severe and critical cases into a single severe group  whereas mild and moderate cases were aggregated into a single milder group 
The clinical outcome at discharge was either cured or death Electronic medical records of all enrolled cases were reviewed by   neurologists using a standard case report form  Appendix S 
Data were extracted on demographic characteristics  medical history  complications  treatments  and presence of risk factors for seizures 
These risk factors were considered to be the following  acute cerebrovascular disease  traumatic brain injury  TBI  central nervous system  CNS  infection  shock  hypoxia  severe metabolic disturbance  based on criteria from the International League Against Epilepsy
 
  multiple‐organ dysfunction syndrome  sepsis  and exposure to drugs or toxic substances Continuous variables were presented as median  interquartile range  and categorical variables as n  All of   people discharged from or who died at participating hospitals were consecutively identified and enrolled 
Most were from Sichuan province  n     followed by Chongqing  n     and Hubei  n    Ten individuals died  giving case fatality rates of    n     in Hubei     n     in Chongqing  and    n     in Sichuan 
Of the   severe cases      received mechanical ventilation  and     were given sedatives 
Apart from the effect of sedatives  mental state was relatively normal in   people 
Eight were encephalopathic  one was obtunded  one was delirious  and six were comatose 
The diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus was not made in any of these cases based on clinical presentation  results of investigations  or response to therapy 
No routine or long‐term electroencephalogram  EEG  was recorded due to exposure concerns None in this cohort had a past history of epilepsy 
None had any seizures  including febrile seizures  or status epilepticus during hospitalization 
Seizurelike events were seen in two people  it was believed that this was the result of an acute stress reaction in one and hypocalcemia in the other The first was a  ‐year‐old woman who reported bilateral bodily spasms lasting for about   minute  with mouth deviation but no impairment of awareness 
She was evaluated neurologically and psychiatrically and was diagnosed with an acute anxiety disorder  which was treated with olanzapine  paroxetine  and diazepam The second case was a  ‐year‐old woman who displayed bilateral myoclonus in the limbs with no impairment in consciousness   hours after admission 
Although this was initially suspected to represent seizures  she was found to have an electrolyte disturbance including hyponatremia  hypokalemia  and hypocalcemia  and the myoclonus resolved with correction of the metabolic disturbances Eighty‐four   cases reported systemic or direct brain insults that increased their risk for acute symptomatic seizures  Table  
The most common risk factor was hypoxia 
No severe electrolyte disturbance was seen  but hypokalemia  n       hyponatremia  n       and hypocalcemia  n       were frequently seen in the cohort 
Urea  creatinine  and serum glucose levels were moderately altered in most of cases 
In two cases who had chronic kidney dysfunction  substantial increases in creatinine levels were noted 
Results of investigations are shown in Table  
One case with TBI had an epidural hematoma  cerebral contusion  and skull base fracture 
Five people with severe COVID‐  experienced septic shock 
Three other cases of shock had hypovolemia or cardiac problems 
Ninety‐four   were given antibiotics  moxifloxacin  n       piperacillin sulbactam sodium  n       and third‐generation cephalosporins  n       were most commonly used We found no new onset seizures or status epilepticus in a large cohort of people hospitalized during the acute phase of COVID   infection despite a substantial proportion having risk factors for acute symptomatic seizures 
This is useful information  given the prior lack of knowledge about seizure risk during the acute phase of infection No individual in this cohort had a history of epilepsy prior to hospital admission 
To date  there is not much information available on people with epilepsy during the COVID‐  crisis 
There is one report of epilepsy in a case COVID‐  from Wuhan 
 
 As information is limited  it is not possible to establish whether this was a patient who had a history of epilepsy or whether the patient presented acute seizures 
There is at this time little if any evidence indicating that people with epilepsy are at an increased risk of COVID‐  infection 
A major challenge for people with epilepsy in this outbreak is nonadherence with the prescribed antiseizure medication  which was seen during the in SARS endemic in  
 
 This indicates the need to ensure the availability of supplies of medications and to advocate patients  self‐management 
Possible strategies for coping could also include online consultations and telemedicine networks Although many neurological and systemic disorders regarded as potential triggers
 
 of acute symptomatic seizures were identified in this cohort  seizures and status were not seen 
Stroke is one such risk factor 
The risk of developing acute symptomatic seizures after stroke ranges from   to  
 
 Acute cerebrovascular disease is considered a major cause of seizure and status epilepticus 
An earlier study from Hubei
 
  
 
 also reported six people with COVID‐  who had acute cerebrovascular disease without seizure 
Infection of the CNS can also give rise to seizures 
Although there is limited evidence of the presence of the SARS‐CoV‐  in the cerebrospinal fluid  CSF  the co‐occurrence of tubercular meningitis
 
 had been reported  with no seizure or status observed 
To determine whether COVID‐  can cause direct CNS insults requires further follow‐up 
In the earlier outbreaks of another coronavirus  a generalized convulsion with a positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for SARS‐CoV in CSF was reported  which could have been a coincidence 
 

Disturbances of homeostasis may lead to acute symptomatic seizures 
Hypoxia  the most common complication in our cohort  may trigger anoxic encephalopathy  particularly in refractory hypoxia 
Electrolyte disturbances as seen in COVID‐  are considered to be potential causes of acute symptomatic seizure 
 
 The severity and speed of such disturbances may affect onset of seizures  so these parameters should be carefully monitored The cytokine storm syndromes
 
 behind severe infection may cause the production of inflammatory cytokines systemically  with the consequence of acute toxic encephalopathies 
Although sepsis is a common cause of encephalopathy in intensive care medicine 
 
 hypoxia appears far more often than sepsis in COVID‐ 
There was also a high rate of septic shock in the COVID‐  population  varying from  
 
 to   in earlier studies in Hubei 
 
  
 

Certain antibiotics have been associated with symptomatic seizure 
 
 Antibiotics were used in a large number of people in our cohort without problems  but the most used antibiotics in the cohort were of low or moderate risk 
Clinicians should keep this seizure risk in mind when prescribing antibiotics  especially for people with renal dysfunction 
 

Our study has several limitations 
First  as a cross‐sectional study  we only have data from the acute phase of the disease 
A follow‐up study is underway to evaluate longitudinal seizure outcomes 
Second  the retrospective study design meant that we could not collect data on all relevant variables  for example  EEG was not recorded  so subclinical seizures could have been missed 
As all health care costs of COVID‐  treatment are covered by the government  all those suspected of infection are screened 
This may assure the objectivity and reliability of study materials  and it will allow for a future follow‐up study Our analysis suggests that COVID‐  poses minimal risk for seizures during the acute illness  although a significant proportion of severely ill individuals have risk factors that may increase the propensity to experience seizures 
These risk factors should be promptly addressed to minimize the risk of developing seizures 
Prospective long‐term studies must be done to determine whether people who have suffered from COVID‐  have an increased risk for developing seizures or epilepsy in subsequent months or years as a consequence of their illness None of the authors has any conflict of interest to disclose 
We confirm that we have read the Journal s position on issues involved in ethical publication and affirm that this report is consistent with those guidelines Decreased prealbumin level is associated with increased risk of mortality in hospitalized elderly patients with COVID The coronavirus disease    COVID  epidemic is caused by an infection with a novel coronavirus  officially named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus    SARS COV 
The infection spread rapidly on all continents and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization 
As of April       documented cases were reported worldwide  and   patients had died 
As there are currently no specific treatments and medications against the new virus  it is crucial to identify risk factors of severe prognosis Older patients have poorer prognostic factors and are more likely to experience critical disease 
 
 
Based on recent statistical data of China  among patients who were   years and older  the mortality rate was   which was significantly higher than that of younger patients at  
The proportion of deaths over   years old accounts for   of the total deaths in the national wide  which implicates aged people are more vulnerable to the SARS CoV 
Till present there are rare reports in literature focusing on the risk factors for poor outcomes of the elderly patients with COVID Serum prealbumin  known as transthyretin  its levels may be lowered not only by malnutrition  but also by inflammation and aging 
 
 
Compared to albumin  prealbumin has a shorter half life  a more rapid rate of hepatic synthesis  and predictable catabolic rate  hence  it may be a more sensitive indicator 
However  whether prealbumin could be an independent predictor of mortality in hospitalized COVID  elderly patients needs to be further elucidated The present study aims to describe the clinical characteristics and to investigate whether the prealbumin can serve as a valuable predictor of in hospital mortality  which might provide evidence for the risk stratification in elderly and help to improve the clinical practice and reduce fatality We designed this study as a retrospective cohort study design 
The elderly patients with COVID  who were admitted to Tongji Hospital in Wuhan from January   to February     were consecutively included 
This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Tongji Hospital  Approval Number  TJ IRB  and was complied with the Declaration of Helsinki 
The data were anonymous and the study was observational  so the informed consent was not gathered 
A flow diagram illustrating patient selection was described in Figure  
 
Inclusion criteria included elderly patients  ≥   years old  diagnosed with COVID  infection 
A total of   participants have been obtained 
Patients having missing baseline or outcome data  died on admission or being transferred to other designated hospitals during hospitalization were excluded 
There were   patients were included in the final analyses Data collection of participants was performed using hospital electronic medical record system 
Information included medical history  demographic data  physical examination  and hematological  biochemical  radiological and microbiological evaluation results were reviewed 
The data collection forms were reviewed independently by   researchers  CL and LYY 
Blood examinations were assessed at the central laboratory of Tongji Hospital following standard operative procedures 
The routine blood test was analyzed using Sysmex XE  hematology analyzer  Sysmex  Kobe  Japan 
The Cobas C   Roche  Mannheim  Germany  was used to measure the biochemical parameters 
Coagulation tests were detected by STA R MAX coagulation analyzer  Diagnostica Stago  Saint Denis  France 
Throat swab samples were collected and were tested for SARS CoV  with commercial real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  RT PCR  kit from DAAN GENE  Guangzhou  China 
The diagnostic criteria and all clinical procedures in this study followed  Diagnosis and Treatment of Pneumonia Caused by New Coronavirus  Trial version   to   promulgated by the National Health and Health Commission of China Summary statistics of baseline characteristics of all patients and stratification by prealbumin tertiles were expressed as frequency and proportion for categorical variables  mean   standard deviation  SD   Gaussian distribution  or median  range   Skewed distribution  for continuous variables  and as percentages for categorical variables 
The differences between groups were analyzed using the χ   categorical variables  One Way ANOVA test  normal distribution  or Kruskal Whallis H test  skewed distribution We examined the relationship of the prealbumin as categorized into tertiles with the outcomes of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation 
Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to evaluate these relationships  then unadjusted and adjusted odds ratio  ORs  and   confidence intervals  CIs  were calculated 
Model   is the minimally adjusted model with only sociodemographic variables adjusted 
Model   is the fully adjusted model with covariates including age  sex  smoking status  history of hypertension  history of coronary heart disease  history of diabetes  history of chronic kidney disease  history of carcinoma  history of chronic liver disease  neutrophil  lymphocyte  prothrombin time  activated partial thromboplastin time  d dimer  alanine transaminase  aspartate aminotransferase  total bilirubin  blood urea nitrogen  creatinine  C reactive protein and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio 
We calculated odds ratio  ORs  and   confidence intervals  CIs 
The highest tertile was the reference for prealbumin 
We performed test for linear trend by entering the median value of each category of prealbumin tertile as continuous variable to examine the possibility of nonlinearity To ensure the robustness of our results  we also performed stratified analyses with the prealbumin as a continuous variable for the overall population and stratified by gender  age  hypertension status and coronary heart disease status at baseline 
Generalized additive models were used to visually confirm the relationship between prealbumin as continuous variable and the risk of outcomes  all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation Modeling was performed with the statistical software packages R  http www R project org  The R Foundation  and EmpowerStats  http www empowerstats com  X Y Solutions  Inc  Boston  MA 
P values less than    two sided  were considered statistically significant In our study    cases were excluded 
To avoid selection bias due to missing data  we performed a sensitivity analysis 
The results showed that there was no statistical difference between missing group and non missing group  supplemental table  Of   elderly inpatients included in the final analysis  the mean age was     years  ranging from   years to   years  and most patients were male  table  
 
The baseline characteristics of these included participants were listed in table 
The day of sample drawing after admission was       day 
No significant statistical difference in sex  smoking status  body weight  BMI  comorbidity  hypertension  coronary heart disease  chronic kidney disease  cerebral vascular disease  carcinoma  chronic liver disease  symptoms  fever  cough  headache  diarrhea and myalgia fatigue at admission  were detected across different groups of prealbumin  tertile 
When compared with subjects in the highest tertile  those in the lowest tertile were older  more likely to have diabetes medical history  with higher Neutrophil count  lower lymphocyte count  worse coagulation function and liver function 
A total of     patients required mechanical ventilation      patients admitted to intensive care unit and     patients died during hospitalization 
The incidence of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation were significantly decreased across prealbumin tertiles  all cause death    vs    vs    for tertile   vs  tertile   vs  tertile   ICU admission    vs    vs    for tertile   vs  tertile   vs  tertile   mechanical ventilation    vs    vs    for tertile   vs  tertile   vs  tertile   respectively To investigate the correlation between prealbumin and in hospital outcomes  we constructed three models using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models  table  
 
In the unadjusted model  the ORs of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation was significantly increased as the prealbumin tertiles downgraded 
The OR for tertile   was significantly higher than the OR for tertile    OR       CI    to   P   for all cause death  OR       CI    to   P   for ICU admission  OR       CI    to   P   for mechanical ventilation 
Additional adjustment for the demographic variables and comorbidities did not reduce the ORs for the association between prealbumin tertiles and in hospital outcomes 
Further adjusting for the baseline levels of blood examinations  including blood routine  neutrophil  lymphocyte  neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio  coagulation function  prothrombin time  activated partial thromboplastin time  d dimer  liver fuction  alanine transaminase  aspartate aminotransferase  total bilirubin  renal function  blood urea nitrogen  creatinine  and infection indicators  C reactive protein  did not affect the relationships in the fully adjusted models  OR       CI    to   P   for all cause death  OR       CI    to   P   for ICU admission  OR       CI    to   P     for mechanical ventilation 
Therefore  lower tertile of prealbumin exhibited an increased risk of worse in hospital outcomes  full adjusted P for trend for all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation  P     P   and P     respectively Generalized additive models  Fig  
A through  C  were used to visually assess functional relationships between the prealbumin as continuous variate and the risk of in hospital outcomes 
Serum prealbumin was found to have negative linear relationship with the risk of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation To determine the consistency of the relationship between baseline prealbumin as a continuous variable and in hospital outcomes  we conducted stratified analyses  Table  
 
For each unit increase of prealbumin  the adjusted OR for all cause death was   in males  P     and   in females  P    
The adjusted OR for all cause death for persons less than   years of age was    P     compared with    p     for persons   years and older  P interaction    
For each unit increase of the prealbumin  the OR for all cause death was    P     and    P     for normotensives and hypertensives     P     and    P     for non diabetic and diabetes respectively 
The difference of interaction was not significant between two groups  P interaction         and   stratified for gender  age  hypertention and diabetes respectively 
Moreover  the relationship between baseline prealbumin with ICU admission and mechanical ventilation stratified by gender  age  hypertention and diabetes are consistent In this study  we found that lower serum prealbumin significantly associated with an increased risk of worse outcomes and all cause death during hospitalization 
Patients in the lowest tertile of prealbumin were older  and with higher Neutrophil count  lower lymphocyte count  worse coagulation function and liver function compared with subjects in the highest tertile 
Then we adjusted relevant covariates including age  sex  smoking status  comorbidities  neutrophil  lymphocyte  coagulation function  liver function  renal function and C reactive protein to minimize the potential impact of confounding 
Compared with crude regression analyses  this association still persisted when adjusting for demographic and clinical variables in the multivariable regression analyses 
Moreover  stratified by gender  age  hypertension and diabetes  increased level of serum prealbumin was associated with the decreased risk of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation  which determine the consistency of the relationship between lowest serum prealbumin tertile and the increased risk of worse outcomes in elderly COVID  patients Several previous studies have demonstrated baseline prealbumin change in COVID  patients 
Decreased level of prealbumin was observed among COVID  patients 
Wu C et al investigated   patients with COVID  and observed that prealbumin was associated with the development of ARDS  indicating the potential value of prealbumin level on COVID  clinical ending 
Till date  no report exists on the effect of prealbumin in COVID  elderly patients High proportion of severe to critical cases and high fatality rate were observed in the elderlyCOVID  patients  and rapid disease progress was noted in the dead 
One possible explanation involves the greater potential of seniors to be in a state of inflammation  nutritional deficiency and other complications 
Prealbumin is a globular  non glycosilated protein  synthesized by the liver  and complexed with a retinol binding protein  which acts as a transporter of retinol vitamin A and thyroid hormones 
Low plasma prealbumin level has far back emerged as an earliest laboratory indicator of poor nutritional status 
 
 
In addition  prealbumin are also associated with inflammation 
Previous studies showed that in response to the inflammation  the body responds by synthesizing a large number of cytokines 
These include interleukins and tumor necrosis factors that down regulate  decrease  plasma concentrations of albumin and prealbumin 
 
 
Therefore  assay of serum prealbumin concentration is recommended by some investigators as a screening marker for both malnutrition and inflammation Elderly with low plasma prealbumin levels mean that those people are at greater risk of malnutrition and inflammatory conditions  which may lead to poor prognosis 
Malnutrition is commonly seen in hospitalized patients in both the developed and developing world  especially among elderly patients 
A review of   published studies of acute care patients reported that malnutrition incidence ranged from  –  of hospitalized elderly 
It was found that compared to non famine regions of India  experiencing famine had significantly higher influenza mortality rates during the   Influenza pandemic 
Aging  frailty  and chronic diseases are associated with impaired immune function and are compounded by immune dysregulation from malnutrition 
When immune response is dysregulated  it would result in an excessive inflammation  even death 
In the current COVID  study  it was found that elderly patients have higher levels of white blood cells counts  CRP  inflammatory cytokines and are more likely to experience critical disease than did those younger patients 
 
 This retrospective cohort study included   elderly COVID  patients  until the date of February       of patients required mechanical ventilation    of patients admitted to intensive care unit  and the total in hospital mortality was  
The mortality rate was lower than that reported by wang L et al  among elderly COVID  patients 
This may have been the reason for some patients at the date of February     are still in hospital 
Nevertheless  this would not bias the relationship between prealbumin and in hospital outcomes because of the definite observation time we set previously 
Moreover  Wuhan tongji Hospital as one of the largest third grade Class A hospitals equipped with advanced life support training and equipment may partly account for the moderate mortality The results of this study have several clinical implications and strengths 
A low prealbumin concentration can therefore be regarded primarily as a signal identifying the at risk elderly patient who would suffer worse outcomes and requires careful assessment and monitoring for whom nutritional support and Inflammation detection may be needed as part of the treatment plan 
As observational study was susceptible to various confounders  we adjusted many variables that may affect the relationship between prealbumin and in hospital outcomes to minimize potential confounding 
In addition  we tested the robustness of the results by repeating the analyses in different subgroups of gender  age  history of hypertension and history of diabetes Our study has some limitations 
First  by including patients still in hospital as of J February     the case fatality ratio in our study cannot reflect the true mortality of elderly COVID 
Second  the record of data may be affected by prehospital medication and the time interval between admission and onset 
Third  since all subjects in our study were hospitalized Chinese elderly patients diagnosed with COVID  results of this study might not directly be applied to other ethnicities and age groups In conclusion  this retrospective cohort study revealed that the prealbumin is an independent risk factor for the in hospital mortality in the Chinese COVID  elderly patients 
Nutritional support and Inflammation detection should be careful assessment and monitoring for the elderly patients with low prealbumin concentration

Coping With COVID  Emergency Stress  Secondary Trauma and Self Efficacy in Healthcare and Emergency Workers in ItalyThe coronavirus disease  COVID  or the acute respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus    SARS CoV  began spreading in China at the end of   and  to date  represents an international health emergency without precedents in terms of its health  economic  and organizational effects on people s lives  World Health Organization   
After China  Italy was the first country to be affected by this epidemic  with the first deaths on February     and a rapid increase in the spread of infection and mortality 
COVID  was first detected in Northern Italy  and it then spread  although at different rates of incidence  to the other regions 
It was immediately evident that healthcare and emergency workers were at great risk of contagion and that protection and intervention protocols needed to be introduced in the absence of adequate points of reference because of the exceptional nature of the epidemic  the rate of spread of the infection  the seriousness of patients  health condition  and the mortality index 
The extreme conditions in which health workers have had to work  especially in the most affected regions in Northern Italy  are indicated by the following data from the Italian National Institute of Health   over   doctors died and   other health workers were infected within the general context of the population of   deaths and   infections in a span of   weeks 
It was also clear that the medical staff would experience serious psychological repercussions because of the working conditions as well as the difficulty of having scientific points of reference on care and intervention procedures 
To this must be added the increase in workload  the extension of working hours and  for health workers  the frequent exposure to the suffering and death of their patients 
Therefore  healthcare and emergency workers were subjected to serious psychological as well as physical stress 
Hence  the aim of this study  which was also the aim of a previous study  Vagni et al    is to focus on the similarities and the differences in the stress management of two professional groups healthcare and emergency workers during the acute phase of the pandemic 
Both groups have had to deal with COVID patients as frontline responders and have been exposed to the related risks of infection and psychological consequences  which  to date  have not been examined in detail through a comparative analysis As regards the stress that they experience  the literature clearly explains that healthcare and emergency workers who intervene in emergency situations are exposed to the risk of developing dysfunctional reactions that can be identified at different levels physical and or physiological  e g  psychosomatic disorders  sleep wake cycle alterations  and sense of tiredness  emotional  e g  irritability  nervousness  agitation  anger  low self esteem  and guilt  cognitive  e g  distractibility  sense of ineffectiveness  and negative anticipation of events  and relational  e g  increase in conflicts within emergency teams and or with their organization institution  and social withdrawal and may also develop reactions from secondary trauma  Del Missier et al    Sbattella    Argentero and Setti    Fraccaroli and Balducci    Bellelli and Di Schiena    Walton et al   
Faced with stressful events regarding which they lack previous experience and specific  necessary knowledge  and which cause tension owing to the need for rapid decision timings and a sense of responsibility  emergency workers may experience a sense of decision ineffectiveness 
In fact  emergency situations are characterized by high levels of decisional and operational uncertainty with associated regret and guilt  Del Missier et al   Several studies have highlighted that insufficient instructions and a lack of personal protective equipment  PPE  are important predictors of stress for healthcare and emergency workers in large scale emergencies  Oh et al    Du et al    El Hage et al    Walton et al   
Oh et al 
  highlighted that nurses involved in managing the Middle East respiratory syndrome  MERS  experienced lower levels of stress when the levels of goods supply and hospital training were higher 
Some studies have highlighted that frontline healthcare workers had lower secondary traumatization scores than non frontline health workers and the general public in contrast to the findings of previous research on the SARS outbreak in the same area in Singapore  Chan and Huak   
According to Barleycorn   and Tan et al 
  these results may be due to the dedicated training and psychological support given to healthcare workers after the SARS outbreak and demonstrate the validity of policy strategies for prevention of stress in the psychological health field An analysis of   studies published from January to March   aimed at investigating the stress experience of healthcare workers in facing COVID  shows that health workers experienced symptoms of depression and anxiety related to this stressful experience 
Moreover  the severity of their symptoms was influenced by their age  gender  role  specialization  type of activity performed  and exposure to patients with COVID  however  prevention  resilience  and social support interventions mediated their response to stress  Bohlken et al   
In a review of the literature  Spoorthy   underlined that sociodemographic variables  such as age  gender  profession  and workplace  and psychological variables  such as poor social support and self efficacy  affect the stress level experienced by health workers 
In addition  COVID  emerged as an independent stress risk factor 
Xiao et al 
  found that social support plays a role in reducing the anxiety levels in medical staff and increases their sense of self efficacy According to Walton et al 
  the specific stressors that health workers face in the COVID  emergency are related to the organizational context 
The challenges for medical staff include not only an increased workload but also a fear of infection  the need to work with new protocols that change frequently  and the use of PPE 
In uncontrollable situations such as a pandemic  when specific action protocols are absent and limited resources are available  health workers must make individual decisions with a heavy burden of responsibility that may be contrary to their moral principles 
For example  in the case of COVID  they may have to choose which patients to save because only a few places are available in intensive care 
In this regard  Cai et al 
  showed that for a sample of   healthcare professionals who worked closely with COVID  patients in Hubei  the most stressful factors were the lack of protocols for the treatment of COVID  the scarcity of PPE  the exhausting work shifts  their concern about the risk of infection  and their exposure to the death and suffering of their patients 
They also found that the support of superiors proved to be one of the most important motivational factors for medical staff  and the presence of clear guidelines and effective safety protocols were protective factors against the development of stress  in particular  for females 
Further  Walton et al 
  identified the organizational stressors as the changes in work shifts  the prevalence of night shifts  an excessive workload  staff roles  autonomy  the lack of support from superiors  and the absence of adequate information and clear instructions 
On the basis of these stressors  they estimated that   of the medical staff working on the front line of this pandemic are at risk of developing post traumatic stress disorder  PTSD 
In addition  limited resources  longer shifts  decreased hours of rest  and the occupational risks associated with COVID  exposure have increased the physical and mental fatigue  stress  anxiety  and burnout of these staff members  Sasangohar et al   The loss of a social support network  which can be an important resilience factor  is another risk factor  Ozbay et al   
In the COVID  emergency  healthcare and emergency workers have often experienced a separation from their affective links  either because of the restrictions on social contacts imposed by the lockdown or the fear of spreading the infection to their family members 
To this must be added that although  at first  health workers received unanimous encouragement from the population  later  they also experienced demonstrations of stigma and isolation 
Some studies have shown that being able to resort to their own social support network is a significant protective factor for health workers dealing with this emergency  Cai et al   As Favretto   stated  when individuals experience situations that go beyond their coping strategies  their vulnerability to  and risk of developing  psychopathological reactions increases 
Studies conducted during previous epidemics  such as the SARS  MERS  and Ebola epidemics  converge in detecting how healthcare and emergency workers may experience extremely high levels of stress and even develop secondary traumatic stress or vicarious trauma 
This trauma is defined as an experience of symptoms similar to those found in people with PTSD  such as in emergency nurses working with traumatized patients  Beck   
Figley   defined it as a form of stress that derives from the feelings of empathy experienced when helping traumatized people 
The symptoms may include intrusive recurring thoughts  disturbed sleep  fatigue  physical symptoms  hyperarousal  increased stress response  anxiety  depression  and feeling emotional  Adriaenssens et al   
Wolf et al 
  described how nurses may feel  overwhelmed  and this condition becomes a source of moral distress that triggers feelings of powerlessness  guilt  fear  anger  and frustration The sense of frustration and impotence felt by nurses when they are unable to treat and save a patient has been highlighted as a risk factor for secondary traumatic stress in several studies  Missouridou   
Avoidance and emotional numbing can become tools for self protection from intrusive symptoms that exceed the personal tolerance level  Coetzee and Klopper    Mealer and Jones   
Their frustration obviously intensifies on a patient s death 
The onset of PTSD in the health workers involved in treating MERS was also detected after the acute phase of the emergency was over  highlighting a risk not only in the immediate period but also in the medium term period  Lee et al   In reference to COVID  updated studies conducted on Chinese health workers have already highlighted the strong impact of the epidemic on the psychological health of doctors and nurses 
Some studies have found that healthcare workers have high levels of anxiety  depression  insomnia  and distress  Lai et al    Li et al    Zhu et al   
In particular  female professionals with more than   years of experience and previous psychiatric pathology present more risk factors of developing the symptoms of stress  anxiety  and depression  Lai et al    Zhu et al   
Huang J 
Z  et al 
  studied stress levels during the COVID  emergency in a sample of medical staff 
They found that females showed higher levels of anxiety and PTSD than males did and that the levels were higher for nurses than for doctors 
Moreover  Li et al 
  found that nurses had developed higher levels of vicarious trauma than those of the general population and that nurses who did not work closely with COVID  patients showed a more severe symptomatology  both physical and psychological  compared with their colleagues working on the frontline emergency services 
In Italy  a study conducted on healthcare workers found that doctors and nurses developed high levels of stress and anxiety  greater than those developed by the general population  and that healthcare workers operating in the North  the area of Italy most affected by the virus  showed a more severe symptomatology  Simione and Gnagnarella   
This study also confirmed that females tend to have a greater perception of the risk of infection  which increases their risk of developing the symptoms of anxiety and distress Because of their long  intense exposure to various stressors  it is important to note the nature of the coping strategies used by these healthcare and emergency workers in these situations and their effectiveness in terms of reducing and effectively coping with stress 
Indeed  the effective management of stress levels in the acute emergency phase could reduce the risk of developing long term PTSD or other pathologies  such as anxiety and depression  Fullerton et al    Slottje et al    Argentero and Setti    Sakuma et al    Birinci and Erden    Li et al   
Coping may be defined as a series of cognitive and behavioral efforts to manage specific internal or external issues that test or exceed individual resources  Lazarus and Folkman   
A distinction can be made between problem focused and emotion focused coping strategies 
The former is aimed at modifying and solving the stressful situation through active interventions 
By contrast  emotion focused coping is aimed at managing the emotions connected to the stressful event and regulating affective reactions  such as anxiety and the tension of response to stress  for example  by trying to avoid the threat  denial  or re evaluating it  reappraisal The choice of coping strategies is influenced by the individual s cognitive evaluation of the event  termed secondary evaluation  which involves estimating the resources available and the most effective strategies to deal with the situation  Lazarus and Folkman   
A key element of this assessment is the extent to which the individual can maintain control over the outcome of the situation 
The literature indicates that individuals apply dysfunctional coping when they face an uncontrollable event by responding primarily with a coping strategy focused on the problem  and conversely  when they face a controllable situation  they respond with coping strategies focused on emotions  Strentz and Auerbach    Vitaliano et al   
A coping strategy may be defined as adaptive when the controllability of the stressful event corresponds with the choice of coping strategy  in this case  the subject will experience fewer symptoms related to stress  Park et al   The strategies used to cope with trauma may differ among individuals  but they can also vary according to the profession and the features of the traumatic event  Nydegger et al   
Individuals differ in their choice of coping strategies  Connor Smith and Flachsbart    and factors related to the situation can also have a decisive influence on such choice  Brown et al   
A few studies have considered the ways in which gender influences the perception of stress in emergency situations and the choice of coping strategy 
These studies highlight that females tend to perceive events as more negative and uncontrollable and to resort more to coping strategies focused on emotions and avoidance  whereas males tend to resort more to applying problem focused coping and to inhibiting emotions  Matud    Matud et al    Matud and Garcia   The literature on the relationship between coping strategies and the stress levels of emergency workers has shown that the use of coping strategies focused on the problem usually tends to correlate with lower stress levels  both in healthcare workers  Watson et al    Howlett et al    and in other emergency workers  such as firefighters  Brown et al   
However  a coping strategy frequently used by emergency workers is that of avoidance and minimization  and this strategy is associated with higher levels of stress  Brown et al    Chang et al    Kerai et al    Witt et al    Theleritis et al   
Loo et al 
  found that in a group of emergency workers  avoidance as well as coping strategies focused on emotions were associated with the development of post traumatic symptomatology 
Rodríguez Rey et al 
  revealed that among health workers working in a pediatric emergency department  approximately   of the variance in PTSD was explained by the frequent use of coping strategies focused on emotions and the infrequent use of those focused on the problem 
In addition  Kucmin et al 
  who considered a sample of   paramedics  highlighted that the risk of developing PTSD symptoms was predicted by the use of coping strategies focused on emotions However  the literature does not offer unanimous results 
Chamberlin and Green   found that in a group of firefighters  all coping strategies actually correlated with high levels of stress  the authors explained this finding by suggesting that it is not the individual coping strategies that are maladaptive in themselves  but that greater effort is needed to adjust in stressful situations 
By contrast  Young et al 
  indicated that firefighters use problem focused coping strategies more often at the beginning of the operation and emotion focused coping strategies more commonly in the phase of breakdown and fatigue 
However  after the incident  they use both strategies  Young et al   
A meta analysis by Shin et al 
  highlighted that different coping strategies have different effects on work burnout  in particular  emotional stress and depersonalization are associated with the use of emotion focused coping strategies  whereas professional ineffectiveness is associated with the use of problem focused strategies Further  a few studies have investigated the coping strategies that emergency workers can use during health emergencies similar to COVID 
Maunder et al 
  revealed that healthcare professionals who tended to apply dysfunctional coping strategies  based on avoidance  hostile comparison  or self blame  tended to develop higher stress levels 
Wong et al 
  highlighted that during the SARS epidemic  doctors and nurses tended to use different coping strategies 
The doctors tended to turn more to action planning  but this strategy did not affect their stress level 
Instead  their stress level was positively correlated with their use of coping strategies based on emotional outlets 
By contrast  the nursing staff tended to resort more to behavioral disengagement and distraction strategies  which  however  correlated with higher levels of stress among them In this regard  during the MERS epidemic  hospital staff tended to adopt coping strategies related to the use of PPE and the adoption of all prevention measures  as well as social support  whereas the coping strategy that they adopted the least was that based on an emotional outlet  Khalid et al   
A recent study on healthcare workers in Hubei  China  during the COVID  epidemic  Cai et al    yielded similar results  to reduce stress  the medical staff tended to rely on active coping strategies  such as using security protocols  practicing social isolation measures  and seeking support from family and friends  but they did not find it necessary to discuss their emotions with a professional 
Huang L  et al 
  found that a sample of nurses working during the COVID  emergency presented greater emotional reactions and turned more to problem focused coping compared with university nursing students 
Emergency workers must have sufficient self efficacy in terms of their coping skills to be able to manage and cope with stress levels 
Self efficacy in coping appears to be an effective protective factor in relation to stress levels and maladaptive responses  Chesney et al   
Self efficacy to cope with traumatic events has been effective in reducing the risk of developing PTSD  Bosmans et al   The main objective of this study is to identify the coping strategies activated by healthcare and emergency workers to deal with stress factors related to the COVID  emergency that may be associated with the risk of developing vicarious or secondary trauma 
Few studies have considered both groups simultaneously when analyzing the strategies they have adopted to manage stress during the COVID  emergency 
Hence  in this study  we are interested in detecting the similarities and differences in the approaches they adopted to manage their stress during the acute phase of the current pandemic According to Walton et al 
  the main acute stress reactions of emergency workers to emergency medical situations are emotional  cognitive  physical  and social reactions 
Therefore  these factors were included in the questionnaire used in the present study 
Moreover  reactions linked to stress factors for difficulties due to ineffective decision making and dealing with stress were also considered  Chesney et al   
In addition  fears regarding contracting the virus and infecting their own families because of COVID  were specifically considered  Du et al    Huang J 
Z  et al    Ornell et al    Walton et al   Based on results found in the literature  the specific objectives of this study are as follows Participants were selected on a voluntary basis through a trasversal sampling in order to take a picture of the situation caused by the pandemic emergency 
We used an internet platform to conduct the study and approached the participants using social media  dedicated mailing lists  and forums 
Participants from all Italian regions completed the questionnaire online 
The sample consists of   participants  males   and   females  whose average age was   years  SD     min   – max  
Further    of the sample were married    were separated  and the remaining   were single 
We selected various professional figures who had directly worked in various sectors during the COVID  emergency and who could be divided into two main groups 
The first  the  Health Group  consists of   participants   who were healthcare workers    doctors     nurses     psychologists   and seven healthcare assistants  
Their average age was   years  SD     and their average years of active professional service was    SD    
The second  the  Emergency Group  consists of   participants     emergency workers     firefighters   and   Civil Protection staff   whose average age was   years  SD     and average years of service was    SD    
There was an age difference between the two groups  t     p   and the distribution of the gender variable differed between the two groups  with   males and   females in the Health Group and   males and   females in the Emergency Group  χ    p    
The study involved participants from the entire national territory  and their workplace could be divided as follows      and   were from North  Central  and South Italy  respectively 
Further    of the sample worked directly with COVID  patients and   worked in specific COVID  departments 
Among the healthcare workers    had worked in direct contact with COVID  patients  whereas among the emergency workers  only   had assisted these patients  χ    p    
In the present study  we included two variables  lack of necessary instructions and lack of PPE  in accordance with the findings in the literature on their impact on the stress reactions of healthcare and emergency workers during the COVID  pandemic 
Among the participants    and   of healthcare and emergency workers  respectively  did not have sufficient instructions to intervene  χ    p n s 
  and   and   of healthcare and emergency workers  respectively  lacked adequate PPE when working  χ    p n s 
 This study used an online questionnaire and was conducted during the lockdown period owing to the COVID  pandemic 
The questionnaire had three parts  one each to collect online informed consent and baseline sociodemographic information  and one with an online series of questionnaires  as described in the next section 
Participants  anonymity was maintained in collecting the data 
The institutional Ethics Committee approved all the procedures This instrument s   items enable verification of the presence of two symptoms of vicarious trauma  Intrusion and Arousal  and their relative frequency 
The STSS was built on the basis of the conceptualization expressed in the DSM   American Psychiatric Association    regarding the characteristic PTSD symptoms 
In detail  the Arousal items describe situations characterized by anxiety  confusion  physical and psychological complaints  and agitation 
Intrusion refers to the re experiencing of the traumatic event even if not directly suffered through internal images and memories 
Instructions for the STSS I indicated that respondents should specify how frequently an item was true for them in the previous   weeks 
The statements are evaluated on a  point scale     never      very often  that provides scores for Intrusion  example items   I thought about my work with victims when I didn t intend to   Reminders of my work with clients upset me  and Arousal  example items   I had trouble concentrating   I was easily annoyed   I expected something bad to happen   I felt jumpy 
The reliability coefficients of the instrument are   and   for Arousal and Intrusion  respectively This is a  item measure of perceived self efficacy for coping with challenges and threats 
This measure focuses on the changes in individuals  confidence in their ability to cope effectively  based on the self efficacy theory  Bandura    Chesney et al   
Participants were asked   When things aren t going well for you  or when you re having problems  how confident or certain are you that you can do the following  Then  they were asked to rate on an  point scale the extent to which they believed they could perform important behaviors for adaptive coping 
The instrument yields three subscale scores   problem focused coping   α      stop unpleasant emotions and thoughts   α     and  support   α    
Anchor points on the scale are    cannot do at all     moderately certain can do  and    certain can do We constructed an ad hoc  item questionnaire that included Yes No questions to detect stress factors identified by the literature  such as the availability of suitable equipment and the receipt of clear instructions during the COVID  coping experience 
In this study  we present the results related to two of these items   Instructions  which refers to having received the necessary instructions to intervene  and  Equipment  which refers to having PPE 
Predictions of these factors have also been made in other studies  Du et al    Walton et al   
In light of the relevance and specificity of the lack of clear information or instructions and adequate PPE in the management of COVID  in the Italian context  as well as the findings in other studies  we decided to focus attention on these two risk factors Our analysis of the literature revealed that in situations in which they have to cope with a pandemic  several factors may affect the stress of medical staff and emergency healthcare workers and that COVID  represents an independent specific stressor  Spoorthy   
These stress factors have been identified as frequently affecting healthcare and emergency workers in emergency situations and leading to physical  emotional  cognitive  decision making  relational  and organizational stress  Del Missier et al    Sbattella    Argentero and Setti    Fraccaroli and Balducci    Bellelli and Di Schiena    Du et al    Walton et al   
Focusing on the specificity of the COVID  epidemic  items have been constructed regarding the fears of contracting the infection and of infecting colleagues or family members  Walton et al    since COVID  represents a factor of independent stress  Spoorthy    that has great impact  Huang J 
Z  et al   
Consequently  we constructed the ESQ consisting of   items assessed on a  point Likert scale  with scores ranging from    not at all  to    very much  grouped into six scales 
The participants were asked to indicate how often they experienced certain emotions and thoughts while performing intervention and emergency activities during the COVID  pandemic The scales correspond to the factors identified and confirmed by factorial analysis through an analysis of the main components with orthogonal rotation of factors  varimax 
The number of factors to be extracted was initially verified through the unit s largest eigenvalue criterion and  subsequently  by the scree test 
The ESQ is based on six scales The ESQ demonstrated good internal consistency  α     overall and for each individual scale  Organizational–Relational Stress  α     Physical Stress  α     Inefficacy Decisional Stress  α     Emotional Stress  α     Cognitive stress  α     and COVID  Stress  α    First  we performed Pearson s correlation analyses to identify the associations between the variables for the two groups that we considered in this study 
Subsequently  we checked for significant differences between the two groups as their stress levels  coping strategies  and secondary trauma 
We used hierarchical linear regression models to verify the predictive effect of the risk factors  lack of adequate information and PPE  on the different stress levels  in step  
Then  we verified the protective effect of the coping strategies  in step  
The models were controlled for age  gender  and group 
Lastly  we used hierarchical regression models to verify the predictive effect of stress factors on the components of secondary trauma 
The models were controlled for age  gender  and group First  we conducted correlational analyses and comparisons of averages on the reference sample 
Table   shows the correlations between the scales of the ESQ and the other instruments Preliminary comparisons were made through the Student s t test between the Health Group and the Emergency Group in relation to the ESQ  CSES SF  and STSS I scores 
Table   shows the comparison between the two groups As shown in Table   significant differences emerged between the two groups in relation to their Stress and Arousal levels 
The results indicate higher levels of both for the Health Group  and that emergency workers turn more to the Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts strategy 
Further  we performed comparisons with reference to the gender variable to detect differences in the levels of stress factors  coping strategies  and secondary trauma 
Females reported significantly higher Physical Stress than males did  Females  M     SD     Males  M     SD     t     p     as well as Emotional Stress  Females  M     SD     Males  M     SD     t     p     and COVID  Stress  Females  M     SD     Males  M     SD     t     p    
No gender difference emerged in coping strategies and secondary trauma 
Within the Health Group  there were significant differences regarding Inefficacy Decisional Stress  F     p     Doctor M     SD     Psychologist M     SD     average difference     p     and COVID  Stress  F     p     Nurse M     SD     Doctor M     SD     difference     p    
Within the Emergency Group  there were no differences in levels of stress and secondary trauma or coping strategies 
Moreover  we found similar correlations between the two groups for the Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts strategy and the stress factors  whereas for the other two coping strategies  we found a different association  particularly for the Emergency Group 
However  the t test comparisons highlight differences only at the level of the Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts strategy 
Given the findings of the preliminary analyses  we considered it necessary to include the age  gender  and group variables to test the predictiveness of the coping strategies on the participants  stress levels To test the predictive effect of the coping strategies on various levels of stress  hierarchical regression was conducted 
Considering the Age and Gender differences within the groups  we included these variables in all models together with the Group variable  Health vs 
Emergency  and the  Instructions  and  Equipment  variables 
The models generated by assuming the ESQ scales as dependent variables are shown in Table  
Regarding the coping strategies  we observed an important effect of the Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts Coping strategy on all the stress scales  except for Physical Stress where the effect of the Focused Problem Coping strategy is recorded As shown in Table   significant negative associations between stressors and secondary trauma were found for both groups 
The hierarchical regression models of stress scales were analyzed for the Arousal and Intrusion levels of secondary trauma 
The models included the Age  Gender  Health Emergency Group variables  and the ESQ scales 
The results are shown in Table  The same regression models were generated by including coping strategies as predictors and were analyzed by Age  Gender  and Health Emergency Group 
Compared with Arousal  the Health Emergency Group and Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts are predictive  R    F     p     Beta  ∗∗∗  Beta  ∗  respectively 
Compared with Intrusion  only the Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts variable  R    F     p     Beta  ∗  assumes significance This study has several limitations 
The first is the limited sample size 
The second is that our study involved participants in the very midst of the COVID  emergency  which means that the level of stress in healthcare workers may have been more severe and acute 
Moreover  the long term psychological implications for the healthcare and emergency population should be investigated for the presence of a full secondary trauma 
Therefore  a large sized longitudinal study is called for to further explore the pathogenesis of vicarious traumatization 
The third is that participants were not selected based on whether they had existing psychological problems 
In proposing the hypothesis of this study  we anticipated that we would be able to discover the relationships between coping strategies  emergency related stress  and secondary trauma in healthcare and emergency workers and commenced our investigation by assuming that the impact of stress can provoke psychological consequences in emergency situations 
In future work  this assumption could be tested to verify whether an emergency situation has a different impact on workers who have already experienced psychological problems The raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors  without undue reservation  to any qualified researcher The studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by Comitato Etico per la Sperimentazione Umana – CESU of the University of Urbino

As reported by some  the association of acute kidney injury  AKI  and COVID  has a high mortality   
However  the incidence of reported AKI associated with COVID  varies widely             
It would be expected that kidney involvement is frequent since the virus enters the cell through the angiotensin converting enzyme    ACE  which is expressed  in addition to pulmonary type   alveolar cells  on renal proximal tubular cells  glomerular visceral and parietal epithelium  and the cytoplasm of the distal tubules and collecting ducts         
In addition  COVID  induces hemodynamic instability and severe inflammation  which  in addition to direct renal infection  can induce acute tubular necrosis  ATN 
We report our experience with AKI in COVID  patients in an inner city  predominantly minority  and a low socioeconomic group and compare our experience with other studies in significantly different cohorts of patients 
We identify the incidence  risk factors  and prognosis of AKI and thus provide a broader understanding of this complication in a group of patients not specifically reported upon to date All adult patients   years of age admitted to the Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center with COVID  infection from March   through April     were studied in this retrospective analysis done in a single medical center serving a low income minority population in Brooklyn  NY 
It was one of the single centers with the most admissions of COVID  patients 
COVID  infection was diagnosed based on clinical presentation  radiographic lung abnormalities  and a positive result of real time PCR 
We excluded COVID  patients from our study if they were on maintenance hemodialysis or were renal transplant recipients 
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Brookdale Hospital and did not require patient consent because of its retrospective design We collected the demographics  the presenting clinical symptoms when available  prior medical history including outpatient medications and prior level of renal function  comorbidities  and in hospital laboratory data from the electronic medical record  Epic Hyperspace   
Laboratory data consisted of complete blood count  hemostasis parameters  renal and liver function  PF ratio  arterial oxygen partial pressure  PaO  fractional inspired oxygen  FiO   creatinine kinase  lactate dehydrogenase  and inflammatory markers including high sensitivity C reactive protein  hs CRP  ferritin  and D dimer 
Normal range of these measures was provided by our laboratory The Kidney Disease  Improving Global Outcome  KDIGO    definition was used to identify AKI 
Estimated glomerular filtration rate  eGFR  on admission was taken as baseline eGFR and was divided into   and ≥  mL min  m 
eGFR was estimated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study  MDRD  equation 
The earliest day of the serum creatinine change that met the KDIGO criteria for AKI was selected as day   of AKI 
The peak serum creatinine value was used to determine the stage of AKI  with an increase in the serum creatinine of  –   –  and   times the baseline serum creatinine defined as AKI stages     and   respectively Continuous variables were described as mean   standard deviation for normally distributed data  or median and interquartile range  IQR  values for non normal distribution 
Categorical variables were presented as frequency and percentage 
The mean of continuous variables was compared by using independent t tests  the Wilcoxon rank sum test  and the Kruskal Wallis test  across the stages of AKI 
The proportion of categorical variables was compared by using χ  test 
Fischer s exact test was used when there were only limited data available 
The Kaplan Meier method  log rank test  was used to determine the cumulative incidence of in hospital mortality 
We used the Cox proportional hazard  PH  regression to determine the association of kidney disease indicators and in hospital mortality 
The assumptions of the Cox PH model were checked using the Schoenfeld residuals  and no violations of the assumptions were present 
In the multivariable analysis  separate Cox PH models were used to determine the association of baseline eGFR and blood urea nitrogen  BUN  on admission  proteinuria  hematuria  and stages of AKI with in hospital mortality since these variables showed a highly significant correlation 
Variables for Cox PH regression were selected using stepwise regression 
Variables with α level of risk factor   were entered into the model 
While evaluating the association of hematuria and proteinuria with in hospital mortality by the Cox PH model  patients with missing values  n     were excluded from the analysis 
All statistical analyses were performed using the STATA version   software and a p value of   was used to determine statistical significance In this study    adult confirmed cases of COVID  were initially reviewed 
Patients on maintenance hemodialysis  n     were excluded from the study and   patients were used for the analysis 
Baseline characteristics of these patients are shown in Table  
  of our cohort were African Americans and   were Hispanics 
The median age of the patients was   years  IQR  –  and   of them were male 
Most of these patients presented with dyspnea   cough   and fever  
  of the patients had a systolic blood pressure below   mm Hg at presentation 
   n     of all patients were mechanically ventilated during the hospitalization 
The median values of ferritin  D dimer  hs CRP  creatinine kinase and lactose dehydrogenase were elevated above their reference ranges  see online suppl

The development of AKI was seen earlier in the course in patients with an eGFR   mL min  m  at presentation   vs    and occurred within   h of admission 
Patients who developed AKI during the hospitalization were more likely to have a systolic blood pressure of   mm Hg at presentation and a lesser PF ratio and were more likely to be intubated during the course of hospitalization  Table  
Eighteen out of   patients with documented chronic kidney disease  CKD  prior to admission developed AKI during the hospitalization 
Baseline laboratory values of these patients who developed AKI during hospitalization and those who did not are presented in online suppl 
Table  The number of patients requiring renal replacement therapy  RRT  during the hospitalization was  
This represented   of all patients and   of those with AKI 
All the patients who required RRT by definition had stage   AKI 
The modalities of RRT were continuous RRT in   patients   of all those who required RRT  and intermittent hemodialysis in   patients  
Two patients   required both modalities of RRT 
    out of   of those patients who required mechanical ventilation developed AKI compared with     out of   of nonventilated patients 
Of these   patients      required RRT 
The majority of AKI stage   patients requiring RRT were on mechanical ventilation   out of   requiring RRT 
  of the patients who were treated with RRT   out of   patients  died during the hospitalization 
Of those with stage   AKI who were not dialyzed    died 
Renal function recovered sufficiently in   patients treated with RRT and both no longer required dialysis upon discharge Urine studies were available for   of all patients  n     and in     out of   of those patients who developed AKI 
Hematuria of   to   was found by urine dipstick in   of AKI patients  while proteinuria of   to   was detected in   of the patients with AKI Overall  the in hospital mortality was   in COVID  patients 
The in hospital mortality was significantly higher in patients with an eGFR   mL min  m    than in patients with an eGFR ≥  mL min  m    at presentation 
The in hospital mortality of AKI patients was     out of   who developed AKI died   Table  A significantly higher in hospital mortality was observed in patients with an eGFR   mL min  m  at presentation  elevated BUN at presentation  and in hospital AKI using the Kaplan Meier analysis  Fig

There was no significant association between in hospital mortality and proteinuria and or hematuria  Table  AKI is common among hospitalized patients  incidence  –  and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality       
In our cohort of   COVID  patients  a relatively higher percentage of patients     of   developed in hospital AKI 
Current evidence suggests that AKI in COVID  patients is a result of an interplay of virus mediated injury  a dysregulated inflammatory response  angiotensin II pathway activation  hypercoagulation  and microangiopathy   
These COVID specific factors likely interact with the other known risk factors for AKI  such as hemodynamic instability  hypoxia  and sepsis  which increased over time 
The increase in the cumulative incidence of AKI over time in our cohort is likely associated with concomitant clinical deterioration and less likely represent a unique renal effect of COVID 
Compared to studies of AKI in COVID  patients from other countries  we found our incidence to be higher than that reported from   Asian countries  –  and is similar to that in an Italian study             
However  it is lower than that in the more recent report by Hirsch et al 
  who detailed their experience in   academic and community hospitals in metropolitan New York   none of which are located in the inner city  lower socioeconomic neighborhoods with a predominant minority population 
As compared with the above cited studies  the incidence of stage   AKI   was highest in our cohort 
It is not possible to determine with certainty the cause s  of this wide variation 
However  we did note a higher prevalence of comorbid conditions in our group 
For example  Cheng et al 
  reported a   incidence of AKI  with a   prevalence of HTN and a   prevalence of DM in their study population 
In our cohort  roughly twice as many   had HTN  and more than   times as many   were diabetic  Table  
Also  the incidence of severe lung involvement that required mechanical ventilation was lower   than ours    Table  
Mechanical ventilation per se has been reported to be strongly associated with AKI   
In our cohort  the incidence of AKI was also higher among those requiring mechanical ventilation  We identified various risk factors for AKI in our study  Tables    
Similar to previous reports  our patients with AKI were more likely to be male  have a history of HTN  and have severe respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation     
In our study  higher BMI increased the likelihood of developing severe AKI 
A low eGFR at presentation more than doubled the risk of developing AKI  p      Table  
Patients with lower eGFR had a significantly higher cumulative incidence of AKI than those with eGFR   mL min  m   p     Fig 
 
Thus  there was a synergistic effect of reduced baseline kidney function and subsequent AKI 
We did not find an association between diabetes and in hospital AKI The role of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors  ACEi  in COVID  is a subject of ongoing debate 
ACEi can increase the expression of ACE  the receptor used by SARS CoV  to enter target cells     
However  ACE  has been shown to be beneficial in acute respiratory distress syndrome when replaced     
This possible protective effect is attributed to the degradation of proinflammatory angiotensin II to angiotensin by ACE 
At present  it remains unclear if ACEi facilitate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus    SARS CoV  cellular entry and intracellular virus replication and whether ACEi improve acute respiratory distress syndrome outcomes 
In our cohort  the use of ACEi was significantly higher in patients with a lower admitting eGFR  Table   and in those who experienced AKI  Table  
We found a similar association between AKI and non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs  but not with angiotensin II receptor blockers  ARBs  in our cohort  Table  
Further studies are necessary to delineate the relationship between ACEi  angiotensin II receptor blockers  and COVID  outcomes Markers of acute inflammation  ferritin and CRP  muscle injury  creatinine kinase  myocardial injury  and D dimer levels were significantly higher in patients with a low eGFR at presentation  online suppl 
Table   and in those with AKI  online suppl 
Table   suggesting causality by a dysregulated immune inflammatory response  the so called  cytokine storm We found an extremely high incidence of mortality in our study cohort 
High presenting BUN and low eGFR   mL min  m  were significantly associated with increased mortality  Table  
AKI was significantly associated with increased mortality 
The mortality risk was highest in stage   AKI  HR   CI  –   Table  
Mortality was   in the AKI group and   in the non AKI group  p    
Mortality rose concurrently with the AKI stages      and   for stages     and   respectively  Table  
These rates were over   and  fold higher than those reported by Hirsch et al 
    AKI    in non AKI 
However  our cohort s high mortality is similar to the findings of John Hopkins University and the American Community Survey 
They reported a   and  fold higher COVID  infection and mortality rate in predominantly African American counties than in predominantly white counties   
Wadhera et al 
  also reported a death rate of   per   in Brooklyn  about   higher than that of Manhattan 
Moreover  in New York City  current age adjusted mortality is highest among African Americans and about   times that of whites   Our hospital provides medical services for an ethnic minority and a low income population in the most impoverished neighborhood in Brooklyn  where   of the residents live below the Federal Poverty Level as per a   report   
  of our patients identified themselves as African Americans 
In comparison  in the study by Hirsch et al 
     identified themselves as whites  and only   identified themselves as African Americans 
The high representation of ethnic minorities in our study population may have contributed to the increased mortality 
This association has been widely publicized and is likely the result of a complex interplay of multiple factors 
These include  but are not limited to  a high burden of comorbidities  genetics  the pernicious influence of adverse socioeconomic determinants of health  the absence of the privilege to work from home  and the ability to follow the recommended social distancing   In our cohort      of the   patients with AKI required RRT 
Nineteen out of these   patients   were mechanically ventilated 
Thus  almost all of the additional requirements for acute dialysis during the COVID  pandemic at our institution were in intensive care units 
Overall      out of   of mechanically ventilated patients required RRT 
Elevated ferritin was associated with an increased risk of all stages of AKI and the need for RRT  online suppl 
Table  
Among those who received RRT      died versus     in the stage   AKI group who did not undergo RRT  p      Table  
Thus  there was no statistically significant improvement in survival  and the mortality remained extremely high in both the RRT and non RRT groups 
These findings should prompt the early involvement of a palliative care team to define goals of care in patients with COVID  disease and stage   AKI In our experience  ultrafiltration was not well tolerated 
It often increased pressor requirements and did little to improve the ventilatory status 
We observed a high incidence of hypercoagulability and frequent clotting of the dialysis filters  lines  and catheters 
Thus  the patients required higher than the usual doses of heparin Our study has limitations 
Although     of the study population had a low eGFR on admission  only     had a documented history of CKD 
Data were collected retrospectively from medical records and often did not have information regarding prior renal function 
Patients also may have had an elevated creatinine on admission secondary to AKI suffered prior to hospitalization 
If so  we may have underestimated the true overall incidence of COVID associated AKI 
It is not possible to rectify this problem  given the data at our disposal Our study is a single center study  with the majority of the study population identifying themselves as African Americans or Hispanics 
This limits our study s general applicability but provides a unique insight into this population and broadens our understanding of COVID  disease 
Data were missing on many patients at different stages of the hospitalization since they were collected retrospectively 
Importantly  little data were available regarding urine output  a defining characteristic of AKI 
With this lack of information  we may have again underestimated the true incidence of AKI Nevertheless  even with the above limitations of our study  the high incidence of AKI and its negative impact upon survival is abundantly clear 
In response to the high incidence of AKI in our patients with COVID  we increased our capacity to deliver RRT 
These efforts included the purchase of additional machines and dialysis solutions  additional staff training  and engineering alterations to allow dialysis on the general medical floors 
Also  we increased our stockpiles of catheters  filters  and dialysis solutions for intermittent and continuous RRT 
We also plan to establish a peritoneal dialysis program to further strengthen our acute dialysis capacity In conclusion  our data report explicitly upon a high proportion of ethnic minority patients in an inner city  severely economically deprived neighborhood  previously not studied 
Our patients experienced a high incidence of AKI and an extremely high mortality  especially in AKI stage  
Unfortunately  RRT provided little survival benefit 
Policy changes and planning in preparation for this high incidence of AKI in COVID  patients are necessary at the local and national levels Study was approved by Institutional Review Board  IRB  Brookdale Hospital The authors have no conflicts of interests to declare The authors did not receive any funding U Z

  supervisor Dynamic changes in computed tomography manifestations of   patients
with novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan  ChinaDuring the first week of December   a few cases of pneumonia caused by a novel
coronavirus appeared in Wuhan  Hubei Province  China 
The patients had a history of
visiting the nearby Huanan seafood market  where wild animals were sold  With the spread of the disease  such cases have also been found in other
parts of China and abroad 
As of   July     cases have been confirmed
worldwide  including   deaths and   recoveries The novel coronavirus was originally named   novel coronavirus  nCoV  it was
recently officially renamed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus  
 SARS CoV  by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses 
The disease
caused by SARS CoV  has been named coronavirus disease    COVID  by the World
Health Organization 
Like SARS CoV  SARS CoV  likely originated in bats  however 
the intermediary animal host remains unclear 
The nearest neighbor of the  nCoV
isolates from China is a bat SARS like coronavirus  Bat SL CoVZC SARS CoV  carries a high risk of human to human transmission  and such transmission
has been reported in family clusters and among medical workers  The main route of transmission
is respiratory droplets and contact transmission  the virus may also be transmitted
through the conjunctiva and via aerosols  Current epidemiological surveys indicate that the latency period generally
ranges from   to   days  with a maximum of   days 
Affected patients present with
pneumonia like symptoms  including fever  fatigue  cough  expectoration 
pharyngalgia  anorexia  and myalgia 
Some patients also have gastrointestinal
symptoms  including diarrhea  nausea  vomiting  and abdominal pain 
In severe cases 
patients may rapidly develop acute respiratory distress syndrome  septic shock 
difficult to correct metabolic acidosis  and coagulation dysfunction Increasing numbers of studies are suggesting the high clinical value of imaging
examinations  especially high resolution computed tomography  HRCT  of the chest  in
patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia –  Typical CT imaging
manifestations include multiple patchy subsegmental or segmental ground glass
opacities  GGOs  and consolidation in the bilateral lungs  The imaging manifestations in patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia often
change rapidly  and many patients thus undergo repeated CT examinations 
Some
patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia gradually improve  whereas others develop
persistent hypoxemia or dyspnea and gradually worsen 
The changes in the patient s
condition are often closely related to the severity of the lung lesions 
Therefore 
observing the evolution of the lung lesions by chest CT is very important to assess
and predict the patient s outcome This study was to performed observe the changes in the chest HRCT manifestations of
  patients with pneumonia caused by SARS CoV  from the time of the initial
diagnosis 
To our knowledge  this is the largest population evaluated to date among
studies of the dynamic changes in imaging manifestations of novel coronavirus
pneumonia Consecutive patients were retrospectively enrolled in this single center study
from   January   to   February  
These patients met the Diagnosis and
Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia  trial version   issued by the National
Health Commission of the People s Republic of China  and their diagnoses were confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction 
According to the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus
Pneumonia  trial version   issued by the Chinese National Health Committee 
patients who developed severe pneumonia during their disease course were
excluded 
Severe pneumonia was defined as severe respiratory distress
 respiratory rate of   breaths minute  a requirement for oxygen treatment
or mechanical ventilation  an oxygen saturation of   on room air  a
partial arterial oxygen pressure fraction of inspired oxygen ratio of ≤  mmHg 
shock  or pneumonia combined with other organ failure All patients were examined using a Discovery CT  HD scanner  GE Healthcare 
Chicago  IL  USA  during a single inspiratory phase 
Before the examination  the
medical staff guided the patient to hold his or her breath and inhale 
After
complete exhalation  the patient held his or her breath  and a CT scan was
performed from the bottom of the lung to the apex of the lung 
The tube voltage
was   kVp with automatic tube current modulation 
The scan time was   s  the
scan interval was   mm  and the scan layer thickness was   mm 
After scanning 
adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction of   and the standard algorithm
were adopted  and the reconstruction layer thickness was   mm 
No contrast
agent was used during the CT scan 
Most patients underwent multiple chest CT
examinations  largely because the clinicians were still unclear about the
evolution tendencies of the lung lesions associated with COVID  pneumonia 
Additionally  some patients had symptoms such as hypoxemia or dyspnea due to
rapid disease progression 
Therefore  multiple chest CT examinations were
required to observe the progress or absorption of pneumonia The major CT manifestations were described using internationally standard
nomenclature defined by the Fleischner Society glossary  using terms such as
GGO  consolidation  and fibrous strips  A semi quantitative scoring system was used to estimate the pulmonary
involvement of all of these abnormalities on the basis of the area involved  Each of the five lung lobes was visually scored from   to   as follows 
  no involvement      involvement      to   involvement      to
  involvement      to   involvement  and     involvement 
The
total CT score was the sum of the individual lobar scores and ranged from    no
involvement  to    maximum involvement 
The number of affected lung lobes was
also recorded 
The images were transferred to an AW  workstation  GE
Healthcare  and anonymized 
All images were evaluated by two radiologists with
more than   years of work experience  and the final scores were determined by
consensus Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS Statistics for Windows  Version
   SPSS Inc  Chicago  IL  USA 
Measurement data are expressed as
mean   standard deviation  minimum–maximum  and categorical data are presented
as the percentage of the group 
A P value of   was defined as
statistically significant In total    CT scans of   patients   men    women  with confirmed COVID 
were collected 
The patients  ages ranged from   to   years  and their mean
age was       years 
Fever was the most common symptom  Table  
The patients
underwent        –  chest CT examinations  and the interval between the
first and last scan was       days  –  days The laboratory results are presented in Table  
Most laboratory results were
normal  with mildly elevated concentrations of C reactive protein
      mg L  D dimers       mg L  and ferritin      
µg L Based on clinical experience  five stages were identified from the onset of
initial symptoms  Stage A  –  days  n     Stage B  –  days  n     Stage
C  –  days  n     Stage D  –  days  n     and Stage E   days 
n    
One patient had a  day history of cough with fever and was in Stage B
at the time of admission 
The frequencies of different lesions in different
stages are presented in Table  
Two patients in Stage A and one patient in Stage E had no
lesions 
Multiple lobes were involved in most of the CT scans in all stages 
Multiple lobe involvement was present in     patients in Stage A   
  in Stage B      in Stage C      in Stage D  and    
in Stage E  GGOs could be seen in all stages  and the proportion of GGOs in each
stage was similar 
The proportion of consolidation first increased and then
decreased over time 
GGOs and consolidation were present in     and  
  patients in Stage A      and     in Stage B     
and     in Stage C      and     in Stage D  and    
and     in Stage E  respectively 
The consolidations in some cases were
absorbed As shown in Table  
the total CT score also first increased and then decreased over time  and the
total CT score of pulmonary involvement was significantly higher in Stage B than
in Stage A       vs        respectively  P    
Additionally  the
total CT score of lung involvement was significantly higher in Stage C than in
Stages B and D       vs         P     and       vs       
 P     respectively 
The number of involved lobes was significantly higher
in Stage B than in Stage A       vs        respectively  P    
Notably  the CT score of the lower lobe was significantly higher than the
corresponding upper and middle lobes in Stages A  B  C  and D  P     for
all 
In Stage E  the CT score of the right lower lobe was significantly higher
than that of the right upper middle lobes  P     and P    
respectively  whereas no significant difference was observed in the CT score
between the left lower lobe and left upper lobe The CT images of a patient with novel coronavirus pneumonia are shown in Figure  
GGOs and
consolidation first increased from Stage A to Stage C  after which the
consolidation gradually absorbed  the GGOs then gradually decreased in Stages D
and E Since the end of   an outbreak of a novel pneumonia in Wuhan has been drawing
tremendous attention around the world 
Chinese government officials and researchers
have taken swift measures to control the outbreak and conduct etiological studies 
The causative agent of this pneumonia has been identified as SARS CoV  a novel
coronavirus 
As its name suggests  its genetic structure is   similar to that of SARS CoV The most frequently affected organ of the novel coronavirus is the lung 
In the
previous version of the diagnosis and treatment guideline for pneumonia caused by
novel coronavirus  the diagnosis was confirmed by the presence of viral nucleic
acids in throat swabs  sputum  and alveolar lavage fluid 
However  the more recent
guideline indicates that if typical chest CT findings are observed in patients
suspected to have COVID  the patient should be clinically diagnosed 
This
reflects the important role of chest CT in the diagnosis 
Moreover  current clinical
experience is showing that the chest CT manifestations change rapidly 
Therefore 
many patients in the present study underwent multiple repeated examinations during
treatment 
To our knowledge  this study is by far the largest case series of
follow up imaging among patients with COVID SARS CoV  infects human respiratory epithelial cells through S protein and has a
strong infection capacity for humans 
Coronavirus particles have a diameter of   to
  nm and can directly reach the bottom of the lung 
Because of lung volume and
gravity  respiratory airflow  and other factors  the type II alveolar epithelial
cells present at the bottom of the lung become the target cells of the coronavirus 
Therefore  the lesions are mainly distributed under the pleura or along the vascular
bronchial bundle  After the alveolar epithelial cells have become combined with the virus  the
alveolar wall is damaged and large numbers of immune cells and lymphocytes
accumulate  resulting in swelling around the lung leaflets and blood vessel
congestion 
The pulmonary lobules merge with each other  forming nodular or patchy
GGOs 
As the disease progresses  multiple lung segments become involved  the scope
of the lesion expands  the alveolar wall shrinks and collapses  and the exfoliated
and necrotic epithelium and the exuded inflammatory cells form a hyaline membrane 
These changes manifest as coexisting imaging abnormalities such as GGOs  nodules 
consolidation  and fibrous cord strips Several studies have focused on the evolution of CT changes in patients with COVID 
pneumonia 
Pan et al  analyzed the disease course according to  day stages and found that the CT
score was the highest on days   to   of the disease course  after   days  the CT
score of the lower lung was significantly higher than that of the middle and upper
lungs 
Zhou et al  found that CT images of patients with COVID  pneumonia showed a
predominantly peripheral  middle  lower  and posterior distribution 
The early rapid
progressive stage was   to   days from symptom onset  the advanced stage with peak
levels of CT abnormalities occurred from   to   days  and the abnormalities started
to improve after   days 
Lei et al  reported that patients with COVID  pneumonia had a typical transition from
the early stage to the advanced stage and then from the advanced stage to the
dissipating stage 
Single or multiple GGOs were distributed along the
bronchovascular or subpleural regions in the pulmonary parenchyma in the early
stage  higher density consolidations were observed in the advanced stage  and the
GGOs and consolidations were absorbed in the dissipating stage 
Xiang et al  evaluated only six patients with COVID  pneumonia and reported that the CT
score peaked at   to   days and that the CT scores of the lower lobes were
significantly higher than those of the middle upper lobes after   days from disease
onset 
These findings were consistent with those reported by Pan et al  Liang et al  reported that the majority of patients had involvement of three or more
lobes 
Bilateral involvement was more prevalent than unilateral involvement 
The
proportions of patients observed to have pure GGOs or GGOs and consolidation
decreased over time  while the proportion of patients with GGOs and linear opacities
increased 
The total severity score showed an increasing trend in the first   weeks 
Bernheim et al  divided the disease course into three stages  –   –  and  –  days  and
found that   of patients in the first stage had normal CT findings 
As the time
since onset of symptoms increased  the CT abnormalities became more frequent  these
findings included consolidation  bilateral and peripheral disease  greater total
lung involvement  linear opacities  the  crazy paving  pattern  and the  reverse
halo  sign In this study  we evaluated the CT findings of   patients with COVID  pneumonia
confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction 
The patients underwent
a mean of        range   –  chest CT examinations 
At present  the course of
COVID  pneumonia and when patients should be re examined remain inconclusive 
As
mentioned above  different studies have staged the disease according to different
time periods 
We grouped the patients  CT scans at different time intervals 
The
time interval grouping was based on current clinical experience and is consistent
with the imaging interval described in the pneumonia diagnosis and treatment guidelines  This grouping is also partially similar to that described by Pan et al  and Zhou et al  Multiple lobe involvement was observed in most patients in all stages  and
lower lobe lesions were significantly more common than upper and middle lobe
lesions  this is also consistent with the findings reported by Pan et al  and Liang et al  As mentioned above  most studies have suggested that patients with COVID 
pneumonia undergo a typical transition from the early stage to the advanced stage
and then from the advanced stage to the dissipating stage  however  the time to
reach the peak of the disease course varies among different studies  and the
patients in our study showed a similar tendency 
GGOs and consolidation were the
common chest CT manifestations  the proportion of GGOs in each stage was similar 
while consolidation and the total CT score first increased and then decreased over
time 
The total CT score was significantly higher in Stage B than in Stage A  while
the total CT score was significantly higher in Stage C than in Stage B 
These
findings suggest that the lung lesions of most patients significantly improved after
  days and that most patients with new coronavirus pneumonia had a disease course
of more than   days This study had three main limitations 
First  we did not consider the effects of
factors such as age  sex  medical history  including hypertension  hyperlipidemia 
hyperglycemia  and malignant tumors  and lifestyle habits  including smoking and
drinking history  on patient outcomes 
Second  although   patients with novel
coronavirus pneumonia were included in this study  the number of patients in Stages
B to E was limited 
Future studies should include more patients and extend the
observation time to ensure that the study results are more representative 
Third 
some studies have suggested that factors such as age  the C reactive protein
concentration  and the interleukin  β concentration may be related to patient
outcomes 
However  we did not perform a correlation analysis between the laboratory
data and patient outcomes In conclusion  we followed up and evaluated   chest CT scans of   patients with
confirmed COVID  pneumonia and found that most patients had a disease course of
more than   days and that the lung lesions of most patients improved significantly
after   days 
The purpose of this study is to help clinicians better understand the
disease course and properly perform chest CT re examinations for patients with
COVID  pneumonia to minimize the radiation dose Transdermal Delivery Systems for BiomoleculesDrug delivery is related to many problems focused on the molecular stability  pharmacokinetic  and amphoteric nature of a substance 
Due to chemical instability and high degradation by enzymatic action regardless of the distance to the specific target organ  all of this is more complicated when the bioactive substance that is intended to be administered is a biomolecule  such as peptides and proteins   Currently  there is a system that is applied to the protein drug delivery  which is a non conventional system developed primarily for protein and peptide drug delivery 
This new delivery system has a higher efficiency that improves the passage of the protein drug to the skin   
The transdermal drug delivery  TDD  system reduces potential exposure to side effects in the host and improves protein stability by also reducing enzymatic degradation  which is very common to occur when a drug takes the most conventional routes to enter the body  such as oral and subcutaneous routes 
Mainly  TDD systems avoid the first pass of metabolism  which occurs in the liver   
The protein and peptide drugs are important in many innovative treatments  such as immunotherapy  where biomolecules  such as antibodies  growth factors  and interleukins  are used 
These are proteins with high susceptibility to degradation to many endogenous and exogenous factors  such as temperature and pH  and most importantly  enzymatic degradation and immune clearance One of the most important advantages of the transdermal route is to maintain drug release in a constant and prolonged release to achieve optimal blood circulation concentrations   
For transdermal protein drug delivery systems  specific methods or devices are used to allow or enhance intact passage through the stratum corneum  SC 
The most suitable systems for the release of biomolecules are the third generation transdermal delivery systems  whose effects are directed to the SC 
For TDD systems of biomolecules and vaccines  thermal ablation and microneedles are the most widely used physical penetration enhancers 
However  there are many other systems that have been tested for transdermal release of biomolecules   that have been included in the second and third generation of transdermal delivery systems  such as iontophoresis and electroporation This article highlights the main technologies used as tools that improve transdermal protein drug delivery systems  addressing them from the point of view of research in the development of transdermal systems where many technologies and devices have a high possibility of use in conventional drug treatments  such as nanotechnology devices 
The authors provide an overview of the various systems that exist in TDD that have been tested and proposed for the transdermal delivery of biomolecules The skin is a three layer laminate that is made up of the SC  the epidermis  and the dermis   
The epidermis is the outermost layer and is formed from the stratified epithelium  the stratum germinativum  spinosum  granulosum  lucidum  and corneum   Fig 
 The SC is the outermost and impermeable skin layer that prevents the entry of most chemicals   
This barrier is formed by around   to   lines of dead keratinocytes  corneocytes  that have united with each other with corneodesmosomes forming a wall embedded in a lipidic matrix 
The extracellular matrix is formed by lipids  such as fatty acids  ceramides  cholesterol  cholesterol sulfate  and sterol wax esters arranged in lamellae  and multiple lipid bilayers  although the matrix is primarily composed of ceramides     
Corneocytes contain involucrin  loricrin  and cornifin around their periphery and have a thickness of   μm  but this can be modified by factors such as hydration and the anatomic site of the skin   
This stratum contains high amounts of keratin inside the corneocytes  and the keratin filaments provide the hexagonal shape and stratum mechanical strength of the corneocyte   
In addition  the SC acts as a barrier  preventing desiccation and pathogen entry and protecting against ultraviolet rays 
The SC also plays an important role in wound repair The transdermal delivery route has been used many times for the local application of therapeutic substances  and it is a practice that is still used and that will continue to grow in the coming years The transdermal drug delivery systems also allow homogeneous absorption and have good pharmaceutical efficiency  reducing the adverse effects that drugs could cause in the host and reduce the drug risk to suffer alterations caused by enzymatic factors and the immune system present in the intrinsic environment 
Besides that  these systems are more comfortable for the patient   This method is formed by steps that start when the therapeutic molecule enters the skin until it enters the blood circulation 
The first step is penetration  which occurs when the drug is deposited onto the specific skin layer 
Later  the permeation step occurs when the molecule diffuses from one layer to another 
Finally  in the resorption process  the drug enters the bloodstream     This type of drug delivery system has advantages over traditional systems because it can allow the storage of small amounts of drugs in the transport and delivery structure  which are developed by nanotechnology using mainly polymeric nanomaterials made with biopolymers  microneedles  and nanoparticles With these devices  it is possible to improve drug delivery and its bioavailability 
Thus  it is possible to reduce the frequency between drug administrations 
The most innovative property is that the device is only replaced when the dose is finished and it can take several days     
The exact side effects that they could trigger are unknown  since they could mainly depend on the type of bioactive drug it contains  which could be related to some effects of the mechanical properties of the skin    Table  Peptides and proteins have long been important resources in the treatment of many diseases 
Many of the therapies that are applied for many diseases have recently used peptides and proteins  which is called biological therapy and focuses on the production of the main proteins obtained from living organisms such as transforming bacteria The main diseases which are treated with proteins are diabetes  hemophilia  infectious diseases  and anemia 
These therapeutic proteins are primarily hormones  interleukins  anticoagulants  and enzymes  which are recombinant proteins 
Other protein drugs  such as calcitonin  rituximab  gemtuzumab  insulin  epidermal growth factor  and interferons  are best known for their importance in the treatment of osteoporosis  lymphoma  leukemia  and diabetes mellitus   The most employed biological protein therapy is immunotherapy  which has several applications 
One of the most important applications is cancer treatment  which is a specific treatment that employs cytokines  a kind of protein produced by the immunity system that helps the patient s immune system eliminate cancer cells and prevents the replication of cancer cells 
These immune proteins are classified in therapeutic groups known as cytokines  monoclonal antibodies  tyrosine kinase inhibitor  and rapamycin receptor inhibitors in mammals  mTOR    
Two main kinds of cytokines are the most importantly used in biological therapies  interleukins and interferons 
Production is carried out with laboratory animals and once extracted and purified  they are used by injection into a human recipient for clinical treatment  e g  monoclonal antibodies 
However  there are many applications for products  such as antibodies obtained from live organisms and these are used mainly for the prevention of diseases such as in the development of vaccines 
The most important pharmaceutical products are listed in Table     Each one of these peptides or proteins has a different method of administration  such as intravenous  oral  topical  or intravesical 
Some other proposed methods of administration that would avoid the difficulties of the route of administration and offer comfort to the user include the nasal  pulmonary  ocular  and rectal routes    which could be as invasive as the traditional routes in many cases 
The main drawback of this type of therapies is that traditional administration such as subcutaneous injection and intravenous administration can modify their effectiveness  since the route of administration may vary in different clinical circumstances  for example  it may contribute to an increase in blood pressure   When any substance  including proteins  enters the bloodstream regardless of the route of administration  these proteins are exposed to many environmental threats such as sequestration by the reticuloendothelial system mainly for macrophage internalization  enzymatic degradation and absorption and elimination of serum proteins by the liver  –   which is an important factor to consider  since it represents a low efficiency in the application of biological therapy due to its high rate of degradation and elimination   
In addition to protecting the lability of all therapeutic proteins  it is also about preventing them from exerting their activity in places that do not require it 
Although immunotherapy is more effective and less toxic than therapies made with chemical molecules  these immune proteins also trigger adverse effects in the host  such as autoimmunities and non specific inflammatory processes   
For these reasons  research is being carried out on the use of alternative technologies with which these side effects can be controlled  such as with the use of nanotechnology using polymers  with which these proteins can be protected  favoring their transport and direct delivery to their objective  preventing them from exerting their toxic effect on non specific cells and sites   Nanocarriers  such as nanotubes    microneedles  MNs   –   fusion peptide carriers    or peptide conjugated nanoparticles  NPs      are some of the main carriers and protective systems used in immunotherapy  regardless of the size or structure of the molecule to be transported and protected  which could be genetic material  interferon  interleukins  or antibodies In   the US FDA approved the use of TDD systems and their use has been increasing in relevance for protein drugs because for some molecules these delivery systems improve the solubility of the compound  in addition to allowing it to pass efficiently through the skin There are important findings in research revealing that TDD technologies allow the loading  transport  and release of protein drugs 
They are very promising for the effective treatment of local cancers  with skin location  and they have a second benefit of activating the immune system from a remote distance 
Some of them have been developed to carry ribonucleic acid  RNA  that can regulate localized gene expression within a known target 
In other cases  it is possible to use an immunologic protein that could produce a strong adaptive immune response against a specific antigen in the case of vaccines  where it could be made with the tumor antigen expressed in the gene  tumor related protein or peptide  specific epitope  or cell lysate   For immunotherapy  it might be possible to employ monoclonal antibody loaded TDD systems and tumor agnostic therapies  non specific immunotherapies  use of interferons and interleukins  and cancer theranostic treatment where SC could be interrupted by a nanogel delivering a drug through the skin and allowing it to accumulate at the tumor site   or these systems may even function by delivering vaccine antigens  cancer vaccines  using nanoparticles and liposomes as antigenic carriers loaded on nanogels to pass the antigen through the SC by iontophoresis   
It is also possible to use microneedles loaded with Dermatophagoides farinae extract to achieve effective allergen release and effective immune response induction   These strategies have a wide range of application in various skin pathological circumstances  in addition to their main role in cancer therapy  and many products are used for the treatment of cancer 
Some of the commercial pharmaceutical products used for cancer therapy  which are administered transdermally  are described in Table     Through the use of transdermal delivery systems  it is sought to increase the solubility and stability  the circulating life  and the pharmacokinetic properties of drug proteins and peptides 
It is recommended to consider that the TDD system is not applicable to many of the biomolecules that are used as medical treatments since the success in the transdermal passage could depend on certain factors 
The efficacy of this therapeutic system depends both on the physical and chemical properties of the proteins and on the percutaneous administration systems of biomolecules to be used 
Regarding protein  the main physical properties to consider are the shape and size  molecular weight  solubility  and amphoteric nature  the latter being perhaps one of the most important to consider since due to its amphoteric property it can migrate in an electric field and its migration direction depends on the net charge that it has 
The knowledge of this property could help to elucidate which are the best percutaneous administration systems to facilitate passage through the SC 
In the case of charged proteins  physical  electrical  enhancers are the best option to use 
The chemical nature of proteins is another especially important factor to know 
This composition could help us to choose the best TDD system through which the protein will pass through the SC avoiding the reactivity of some functional groups of proteins 
For these reasons  there is little increase in the development of new therapeutic formulations administered by TDD systems  since there are some protein properties that need to be studied and analyzed to know if they can be administered by this route without affecting its stability and pharmacokinetic properties Peptides are molecules that have a molecular weight between   Da and   kDa 
This molecular weight depends on the molecular structures and their lengths with a small amount of amino acids or constitutes a protein with a complex structure 
These molecules are charged in a physiological pH and are hydrophilic  which complicates their permeability across the skin 
Some drugs have a lower or higher affinity with the lipophilic condition of the SC  which determines the quantity of the molecule that can cross this layer of the skin naturally 
Therefore  it is better to use a technique that improves passage to the skin  using or not natural permeation molecular routes avoiding the degradation of peptides or proteins and ensuring passage and integrity during the transport and release processes   There are important skin conditions that can change permeability  such as age  heat  racial differences  freezing  abrasion  chemical irritant activity  and some diseases such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis 
It is very important to recognize these for the development and use of devices employed in transdermal protein drug delivery In the skin  three molecular permeation routes are the most important  intracellular  intercellular  and follicular routes 
All of these are beneficiated by the concentration gradient of the molecules present in the milieu  allowing passive diffusion across the SC   
Moreover  physicochemical properties from the molecule affect its passage through the SC 
Hydrophobic molecules can cross the SC intercellularly  whereas hydrophilic molecules cross intracellularly by corneocytes 
Passage through the skin can take place through so called cutaneous defects  in which the skin has a discontinuity  such as sweat glands or hair shafts   In the skin  the SC and lipid layers have a barrier function  as both prevent the loss of water and avoid the entry of any substances  molecules  or microorganisms from the environment or microbiome 
These layers play a crucial role in the passive passage of proteins and other chemicals into the skin 
The liquid flux between the lipid layer depends on the lamellar and linear lipid matrix arrangement 
The lamellar layer is generally oriented parallel to the SC  and linear lipids are perpendicular to the SC 
If no long periodicity phase  LPP  exists  the permeability increases   
However  if the orthorhombic phase  OP  predominates  the permeability of the lipids is reduced  and if the OP predominates in the lateral layer  the permeation decreases   
The LPP is primarily formed by ceramides  cholesterol  and free fatty acids  and these have a unique tri layer organization  while an all trans chain lipid organization exists in the OP phase  which has a rectangular crystalline lattice and no mobility Transdermal drug delivery has been used for many years  and the skin was thought to be impervious to exogenous chemical molecules 
Currently  it is known that the skin is a semi permeable barrier  which allows its use as a transport route for molecules  allowing the molecule to reach the therapeutic target intact 
However  due to its anatomy  hydrophilic molecules can only pass through the skin if they are small  and even then  in many cases  they require help from an electric field  electrotherapies  as in the case of electroporation   and iontophoresis   
These techniques use a low voltage supplementation  direct current  around the drug site  allowing and enhancing passage through the skin   
When an electric field is applied to the skin  a large molecular movement occurs and the molecule can take the path of the hair follicle through the skin or induce pore formation     There is another technology using acoustic transmission  sonophoresis  that is used in medical trials  such as hyperthermia treatment  physical therapy  and ultrasonic surgery  which has the ability to facilitate drug transport to the skin   
Through this technique  mechanical waves of medium or low frequency are transferred to a physical medium  such as a specific gel  which allows it to propagate and transmit energy 
In the ultrasonic system  wave sounds have an oscillation frequency greater than   kHz   The TDD systems are an alternative route that allows the control of the drug release and decreases the possibility of any side effects associated with levels that are higher than the minimum pharmacological concentration  reducing pharmacological dosing times because a patch is administered every   to   h  This eliminates the risk of metabolism of the therapeutic agent and the loss of the available dose 
In addition  there are other advantages  such as the noninvasive drug delivery method  which can be discontinued at any time   
To facilitate TDD to improve SC permeation  some technologies improve drug flux of difficult drugs    such as cryioneumatic and photpneumatic technologies  sonphoresis  iontophoresis  electroporation  jet injection  and MN  which are used in the delivery of many drugs   The disadvantage in the above cases is that all devices require a low voltage supplement 
In addition  it is necessary to purchase equipment to manage the electrical current 
In addition  in some people it can cause sensitivity  such as tingling and irritation  and the technique can even cause blistering of the skin 
In these cases  when the technique is not well applied  it can cause burns to the skin 
In all circumstances  these techniques must be applied by trained personnel Despite these drawbacks  considerable research has been focused on the transport of peptides through the skin with good results 
In Table   we list some examples of these studies  the biomolecules and penetration enhancers  and the main result of each 
The table also indicates whether the physical penetration enhancer acts alone or is enhanced by a combination with another enhancer or nanocarrier    –  Many compounds have been employed to improve the penetration of substances across the skin  such as azone  pyrrolidones  alkanols  sulfoxides  glycols  alcohols  and surfactants   
Each of the chemical penetration enhancers has a specific action mechanism in the skin penetration process Due to the characteristics of the upper layer of the skin  which is specialized in avoiding and preventing the entry of any molecule or pathogen  the SC is complicated in terms of the passage of molecules greater than   Da  but it is not impossible 
In many cases  this process can be carried out using penetration enhancer molecules  which have good results in terms of penetration of molecules through the skin 
However  it represents a disadvantage because it could permit not only pathogens but also microorganisms in the cutaneous microbiota to enter as a consequence of cellular disruption integrity and the focal detachment of superficial corneocytes  such as in the use of thioglycolate in depilatory treatments   
The process of percutaneous absorption of a therapeutic molecule consists of several processes  which include the dissolution and release of the therapeutic agent  partition and diffusion within the SC  partition from the SC to the aqueous phase of the epidermis and its diffusion  and finally  access to the systemic circulation and target tissue There are three routes through which any molecule can breach this and reach the microcirculation through the tissue 
These are the intercellular  transcellular  and transappendageal routes  but the route can depend on the drug s molecular weight  Fig 
    Chemical penetration enhancers are a good alternative to allow the passage of biomolecules  but most of them cause skin irritation  which is uncomfortable for patients   
In many cases  the penetration enhancers have synergic activity when they are used in combination    but they can generate more skin irritation problems 
The mode of action of these enhancers is different for each one and depends on the mechanism by which it interacts with the compounds of the SC 
Due to this capacity  it has been classified according to their interaction ability in those that  a  interact with lipid heads within aqueous domains of the lipid bilayers and interact with the lipid alkyl chain   b  interact with actin filaments in the corneocytes   c  allow partitioning augmentation and increase drug protein solubility in the SC  and  d  improve penetration indirectly  modifying the drug  Fig 
    
Some of the most studied chemical penetration enhancers are the terpenes  amide  fatty acids  monoglycerides  and surfactants  and some of the most commonly studied are  D limonene  azone  lauric acid  monoolein and sodium lauryl sulfate   Depending on their chemical structure  some polymers can transport drug molecules within their structure  as in the case of cyclodextrins and their derivatives together with other saccharides  moieties  that can transport drugs as ketoprofen   or biomolecules such as levothyroxine sodium  T  which has been used as a topical treatment to eliminate lipid deposits in subcutaneous adipose tissue 
The main problem with this type of application has been the IT  detection in rabbits   h after the application of the cream 
The use of dimethyl cyclodextrin as a solubilizer for levothyroxine increased its solubility  but unfortunately  it only succeeded in penetrating much less levothyroxine through the skin than the required dose in humans   
In this way  it is important to highlight that the complex improves the solubility of the molecule allowing it to pass through the SC  and in another specific treatment  it could recognize a specific target in the cell plasma membrane and then adhere to it and release its content in a more efficient way Proteins are a substantial problem when we try to pass them through the skin 
First  they are larger  and second  they are highly susceptible to enzymatic degradation 
Not all are thermostable  and finally  another difficulty is that proteins and peptides live for a short time in plasma 
For this  it is necessary to protect them during their trip to the place of action 
Furthermore  this protection enables controlled delivery 
Passing through the skin can be less difficult if the protein is in a capsule  which is best when the capsule size is in the nanometric range Advances in the science of polymers applied in pharmacy have allowed the development of many encapsulation techniques that range from the most impractical to the most revolutionary methods 
However  this reveals a problem  as some polymers are not soluble in water and require organic solvents 
Furthermore  the integrity of the protein to be encapsulated is compromised regardless of the encapsulation technique Many types of polymers could be used in drug delivery  however  their chemical structure and molecular weight do not allow dissolution in water in many cases  and most dissolve well in organic solvents 
The solubility of the polymer is a characteristic that is important to determine before use because it can determine the environmental resistance in the process in which it will be used Biopolymers and their combinations are best used for these procedures  helping to improve the stability of the formulation as in the case of encapsulating transforming growth factor  TGF β  in poly d l lactic co glycolic acid   PLGA  and polyethylene glycol  PEG  polymeric microparticles for bone regeneration   
Insulin loaded PCL PEG PCL NPs are another example where the NPs were prepared by the w o w double emulsion solvent evaporation method and demonstrated satisfactory insulin delivery and efficacy in treating diabetic rats   
These NPs possess a specific protein drug delivery with a delivery degradation speed 
They are hydrophobic or hydrophilic according to what is necessary for the encapsulation procedure and for improvement in the stability of the protein drug 
They have a low or no chance of rejection and are safe to use Encapsulation processes are classified into two types  chemical and mechanical  which are then classified according to the methodology used to make the capsule 
This can be determined according to the desired size  shape  and composition surface chemistry 
The encapsulation of biomolecules by these methods allows us to avoid the degradation of the free protein and allows the prolonged and constant release of a protein drug in constant time     With these methods  it is possible to obtain nano sized particles  which are especially important to avoid their elimination by the immune system and the liver   
Smaller and softer particles can better evade the immune system  and this can be compatible with the recipient organism 
It is important to note that capsules with a diameter size of ≤  μm have the risk of being engulfed by phagocytic immune cells  therefore  the recommended NP size that could have an appropriate delivery range is   to   nm   Dendrimers are three dimensional NPs  like macromolecules  and are considered based on nanometric size 
These are radially symmetric and comprise an inner core structure made up of a central atom covalently bonded between other atoms 
The external composition is highly branched  forming a dendrimer structure 
These branches allow the formation of cavities into which bioactive molecules   can be incorporated  such as proteins   and peptides used for many pathological treatments   and for storage  transport  and controlled delivery There are many types of dendrimer structures  and depending on the synthesis method  these methods could use click chemistry   and divergent and convergent strategies 
In addition  there are different designs and chemical elements 
Their application in the administration of drugs has focused on the fact that these have many biocompatible characteristics 
These characteristics include non immunogenicity  non toxicity  and a high ability to cross biological barriers  such as cell membranes  blood vessels  intestines  and the blood brain barrier   In addition  they have high stability in blood circulation and a prolonged blood circulation half life  and they target specific structures 
These NPs can be manufactured in high purity and have some degree of in vitro toxicity when manufactured with cationic and anionic surface groups 
However  it is possible to reduce this toxicity by using surface protection by PEGs or fatty acids   In TDD systems  dendrimers have been employed for the penetration of nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs  such as indomethacin  which is an arthritis and osteoarthritis auxiliary drug in the treatment of the pain generated from this disease 
There is a study that reports the progress of the TAT PAMAM dendrimer system developed as a non viral vector for the transdermal release of DNA plasmids where the dendrimer system was modified 
The HIV transcriptional transactivator  TAT  was conjugated as a cell penetrating peptide to enhance the uptake of constructed plasmid DNA pIRES H GFP by cells   
Dendrimers are an excellent drug penetration enhancer   and they are some of the best nanostructures that have high applicability in medicine for the delivery of peptides and proteins As mentioned  traditional routes  intradermal  gastric  or intravenous  have long been the main delivery route for all drugs 
Nevertheless  the appearance of an increase in chronic diseases has allowed the development of new technologies that are less invasive and have high efficiency upon reaching the target  especially in cases in which a user must take more than one medicine for the treatment of one or more diseases at a time Although the design and use of MNs can ensure the entrance of molecules across the skin  biomolecules have a high degradation risk that can occur at any time  in the charging process or at the moment of release 
Thus  it is better to protect the protein contained within a specialized structure  such as nanocapsules or dendrimers  NPs in both cases 
This procedure has no danger for the protein or peptide structural composition  which improves the conservation and passage of these compositions across the SC  Fig 
 The PLGA NPs can go through SC better with the help of MNs because the micro conduits created by these needles allow the NPs to avoid the SC barrier and arrive at other skin layers and deliver the complete contents  Fig 
    
For this procedure  it is necessary to consider that  in all cases  the penetration capacity of NPs depends on the particle and channel size   
Despite this important consideration  among others  the procedure also avoids the limitations of the skin s physicochemical properties that do not permit crossing it Some experimental studies have demonstrated the penetration and distribution of PLGA NPs in MNs   
The most common use of NPs MNs is for experimental insulin release systems using murine models in rats with induced diabetes  where the insulin is introduced into H O responsive mesoporous silica NPs  and MN patches are manufactured for later transdermal application 
Its release behavior analysis demonstrated effective release   
For immunity induction  an excellent response occurs when the NPs MNs were employed 
For example  for the induction of immunity against endogenous prostate cancer stem cell antigen RALA pPSCA  the immunization via the NP MN release system resulted in anti tumor activity in both cases of prophylactic and treatment assays in vivo   
Another experimental process that allows probing the system efficacy is the use of poly methylmethacrylate  coated with   nm of gold NPs  which has great potential in tumoral cell destruction   Currently  there are few authorized devices  however  these are increasing because for many treatments  such devices are more appropriately used  effective  and exhibit more recommended results 
Perhaps shortly  these devices will be the most appropriate techniques for drug and protein delivery systems For many decades  a great number of therapies to resolve the problems associated with drug release have been implicated to probe numerous kinds of devices and pharmaceutical innovations to solve many diseases or applications in various clinical trials for the diagnosis of diseases or treatments of diseases 
For this application  it is necessary to design new technologies  and pharmaceutical chemistry has been concerned with offering the best administration methods for therapeutic agents Lately  many research studies have reported numerous results that indicate the most appropriate technologies to use in each case of a drug delivery system 
Each of the aforementioned TDD systems has some advantages and disadvantages for use in administering protein drug delivery However  these technologies create substantial and important opportunities for administering biomolecules 
In the coming years  we will observe an increase in their design  development  characterization  and clinical trials for the treatment of many important and chronic diseases SARS CoV  recruits a haem metabolite to evade antibody immunityDNA fragments encoding SARS CoV  S   Uniprot ID  P DTC  residues  –  NTD  –  RBD  –  SARS CoV  S   Uniprot ID  P  residues  –  HCoV NL   Uniprot ID  Q Q S  residues  –  HCoV OC   isolate LRTI  NCBI accession code KX  residues  –  were codon optimised for expression in human cells and cloned into pQ C xStrep vector   under control of the cytomegalovirus  CMV  promoter for production of the recombinant proteins carrying a C terminal extension containing human rhinovirus    C protease recognition site followed by a TwinStrep tag

Editor
As new research has emerged about COVID  transmission  personal protective equipment  PPE  and patient management guidelines have evolved 
This has led to rapid guideline changes within healthcare systems 
Conflicting guidelines can contribute to miscommunication  increased stress  and reduced cohesion among surgical teams 
To successfully implement new guidelines during times of crisis  specific and timely feedback can be used to identify and resolve breaches in infection control  and promote feelings of support among healthcare workers Although inherently less complex than live surgery  feedback in stressful simulated scenarios can provide information about common pitfalls and provide a safe environment in which to practice new skills 
Our group found that when under stress  mental practice coaching combined with feedback significantly enhanced performance compared to simulation alone by better preparing individuals to execute action 
Feedback and mental rehearsal can help improve individuals  knowledge of guidelines and confidence in their abilities to perform under stress 
Critical skills to master in this new environment include PPE donning and doffing  performing procedures on COVID positive patients while in PPE  and new workflow protocols Within normal workflow  new technical skills and adherence to new operative safety protocols may be improved by video based feedback 
In a randomized study  coached trainees using video feedback made approximately half the number of technical errors when compared with those receiving conventional training 
This coaching has been extremely well received when implemented in multidisciplinary teams 
Non technical performance can also be improved through structured curricula combined with debriefing and feedback Under the best of circumstances  it can be challenging to provide the feedback necessary to maintain and improve individual and team performance 
Our team developed the operating room  OR  Black Box®  Surgical Safety Technologies  Inc    a technology that continuously captures and synchronizes multiple sources of intraoperative video and audio data 
Postoperatively  analysts identify safety threats and resilience supports that may respectively contribute to  or help to avoid adverse events  so targeted interventions can be implemented to promote patient safety 
Over the last ten years  our group has researched effective ways to reduce surgical error and optimize surgical safety using feedback – To address the need for feedback during the COVID pandemic at our institution  we developed the COVID Black Box 
Data from simulation scenarios on COVID positive patients recorded via the COVID Black Box is assessed to detect breaches in infection control practices  and identify suboptimal performance for improvement 
Specific and timely feedback is provided to equip OR personnel on how to correct misinformation  improve responses  and facilitate behavioural change on an operative team level 
Although formal analysis has yet to be conducted  qualitative downstream effects of feedback observed include an increased sense of control  reduced stress  improved team communication  feelings of managerial support  and more positive attitudes indicative of the organizational safety culture During this global pandemic  hospitals and surgical departments should not underestimate the importance of providing their teams with feedback 
Hospitals without comprehensive recording capabilities should establish systematic methods of providing feedback to OR teams such as video recording operations or assigning dedicated observers to record breaches in safety practices 
This feedback should be presented to surgical teams immediately and continuously  and collated for the larger institution on a regular basis to transparently communicate lessons learned from previous surgical cases 
Specific and timely feedback may reduce preventable errors in surgery during the pressures of the pandemic 
With ongoing effort to support our surgical teams and better performance  we can help our front line OR staff and patients during both the first  and subsequent waves of this pandemic The Global COVID‐  Observatory and Resource Center for Childhood Cancer  A response for the pediatric oncology community by SIOP and St  Jude GlobalAfter rapidly spreading across the globe  COVID‐  officially became a pandemic on March    
 
 Initial reports suggested that patients with comorbidities were at higher risk  causing concern that children with cancer were at risk of developing severe infection 
 
 Furthermore  measures to mitigate the spread of the virus  such as delaying medical procedures and travel restrictions  were anticipated to disturb the continuity of pediatric cancer care 
 
 It was also anticipated that the effects of the pandemic on health systems would amplify existing obstacles to caring for children with cancer 
 

Since the beginning of the pandemic  a deluge of information regarding disease characteristics and possible management strategies was disseminated 
This infodemic  an overabundance of information during an epidemic 
 
 has posed challenges never encountered before and was an early concern 
 
 The rapid spread of information and misinformation  potentiated by social media platforms  presented a public health challenge  confusing and overwhelming healthcare professionals and lay public alike In response to the need for a trusted resource with curated  reliable information and a platform to share experiences for the pediatric oncology community  the International Society of Pediatric Oncology  SIOP  and St  Jude Children s Research Hospital  SJCRH  created the Global COVID‐  Observatory and Resource Center for Childhood Cancer  GCORCCC 
The GCORCCC was launched as an open‐access website  covid childhoodcancer org  on April    The Resource Library contains updated curated peer‐reviewed manuscripts  guidance documents  and links relevant to the multidisciplinary care of children with cancer during COVID‐ 
 
 Publications are reviewed and assessed for relevance weekly for inclusion 
 
 We prioritize the dissemination of accurate data and quickly identify and address misinformation or conflicting reports 
Only peer‐reviewed articles are included  as unvetted scientific information  such as preprints  were identified as a risk for misinformation for providers 
 
  
 

The sections of the Resource Library are as follows  COVID‐  and Pediatric Oncology  General COVID‐  Information  Treatment  Prevention  For Healthcare Providers  and For Patients and Families 
Each section provides a collection of publications  guidance documents  recorded webinars  and relevant links To address the needs of healthcare professionals during this unprecedented time  resources focusing on leadership  self‐care  and resiliency are also included in the Resource Library 
Additionally  a subsection specifically aimed at nurses  with literature and guidance documents  was developed 
The Pediatric Oncology Nursing during COVID‐  Fact Sheet summarizes the most relevant guidance for caring for children with cancer and is available in six languages as a quick bedside reference 
Finally  a section with resources for patients and families aids bedside providers in educating and navigating patients and families toward trusted  accurate sources of information At the beginning of the pandemic  the natural history of COVID‐  in children and adolescents with cancer was unknown 
To gain an accurate picture of the burden of COVID‐  among this patient population  we developed the Global COVID‐  Registry 
Healthcare providers worldwide were invited to voluntarily report any patient  under   years of age  with a malignancy or history of hematopoietic stem cell transplant at the time of a laboratory‐confirmed SARS‐CoV‐  infection 
The Registry was approved by the SJCRH Institutional Review Board As of December      cases from   countries have been reported 
Using aggregate data  we created an interactive data visualization dashboard to provide updates in a dynamic format  Figure  
The data visualization allows providers to filter cases by variables such as underlying diagnosis  cancer treatment  and COVID‐  outcomes Creating an opportunity to bring the global community of healthcare professionals together is an essential component of the GCORCCC 
The Collaboration Space provides a forum for healthcare professionals to interact and share their experiences and questions about caring for children with cancer during the COVID‐  pandemic 
The Collaboration Space has language translation capabilities  making it accessible to a large number of providers globally 
Here  users are also able to access content  such as videos  blog posts  and live events Through sharing experiences  providers can support and learn from each other 
From the Frontlines is a blog series published to highlight unique accounts of childhood cancer providers navigating COVID‐  around the world 
To date  the blog features stories from   providers in   countries 
These providers discuss the challenges their teams have faced and innovative solutions they have employed to continue to treat children with cancer during the pandemic 
Currently  there are   total active users registered in the Collaboration Space who have connected and interacted over   times with content elements A rapidly evolving pandemic poses many challenges in caring for children with cancer 
The GCORCCC established a mechanism to generate and transfer knowledge for the pediatric oncology community during a global pandemic and infodemic 
Through its various elements  users can access relevant information to help them adapt and respond to the rapidly shifting situation Academic institutions and professional societies should play central roles in the accurate and timely dissemination of information 
For professionals caring for children with cancer  the sharing of experiences from regions that were affected early in the pandemic was essential for formulating the initial responses to the evolving pandemic 
 
  
 
  
 
In addition  guidance for the management of COVID‐  for different patient populations was generated by government agencies and professional societies with remarkable speed 
 
  
 
  
 
Importantly  information sufficiency has been linked to less stress and worry amongst health care professionals 
 
 For this reason  a resource like the GCORCCC can support individuals to decrease burn out and improve resilience 
This effort brought colleagues together and facilitated a sense of community in these trying times  in an innovative approach to addressing global challenges in pediatric cancer care 
Many organizations attempted to compile listing of resources that are relevant to their specific populations  but few of them also sought to create knowledge about COVID‐  in their populations to add to the evidence‐based literature At a time of exceptionally high stakes for children with cancer  the multi‐stakeholder collaboration that led to the GCORCCC represents a framework for global cooperative efforts in the future 
SIOP and SJCRH formed a partnership aimed at disseminating the GCORCCC widely and rapidly throughout the global network  leveraging the strengths of both organizations 
This platform shows that novel  dynamic information resources can help provide guidance to frontline providers across the globe  facilitating the rapid sharing and adoption of new information in highly dynamic situations 
The collaborations built through this rapid multidisciplinary implementation and global dissemination process provide a foundation upon which the global community can collectively build to ultimately improve outcomes for all children with cancer everywhere In memoriam  This manuscript is dedicated to Dr  Arturo Moreno  past president of SLAOP SIOP Latin America  a tireless advocate for children with cancer in Mexico  Latin America  and the world The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest Recombination Every Day  Abundant Recombination in a Virus during a Single Multi Cellular Host InfectionAs increasing numbers of full length viral sequences become available  recombinant or mosaic viruses are being recognized more frequently   
Recombination events have been demonstrated to be associated with viruses expanding their host range   or increasing their virulence    thus accompanying  or perhaps even being at the origin of  major changes during virus adaptation 
It remains unclear  however  whether recombination events represent a highly frequent and significant phenomenon in the everyday life of these viruses Viruses can exchange genetic material when at least two different viral genomes co infect the same host cell 
Progeny can then become hybrid through different mechanisms  such as reassortment of segments when the parental genomes are fragmented    intra molecular recombination when polymerases switch templates  in RNA viruses     or homologous or non homologous recombination  in both RNA and DNA viruses 
Quantification of viral recombination in multi cellular organisms has been attempted under two distinct experimental approaches  in vitro  in cell cultures     and in vivo  in live hosts    
The in vitro approach  which has so far been applied only to animal viruses  allows the establishment of the  intrinsic  recombination rate in experimentally co infected cells in cell cultures   
However  it does not necessarily reflect the situation in entire  living hosts  where the frequency of co infected cells is poorly known and depends on many factors such as the size of the pathogen population  the relative frequency and distribution of the different variants  and host defense mechanisms preventing secondary infection of cells 
The in vivo experimental approach is closer to biological conditions and may thus be more informative of what actually happens in  the real world However  as discussed below  numerous experimental constraints have so far precluded an actual quantification of the baseline rate of recombination 
First  many experimental designs have used extreme positive selection  where only recombinant genomes were viable  e g    
Other studies did not use complementation techniques but detected recombinants by PCR within infected hosts or tissues    which provides information on their presence but not on their frequency in the viral population 
So far  no quantitative PCR or other quantitative method has been applied to evaluate the number of recombinants appearing in an experimentally infected live host 
Finally  recent methods based on sequence analysis inferred the population recombination rate  rather than the individual recombination rate   
While results from these methods certainly take in vivo recombination into account  there are other caveats  isolates have often been collected in different hosts sometimes in different geographical regions and sometimes the selective neutrality of sequence variation on which these estimates are based is not clearly established 
Estimates from such studies by essence address the estimation of the recombination rate at a different evolutionary scale Taken together  the currently available information indicates that no viral recombination rate has ever been estimated directly at time and space scales corresponding to a single multi cellular host infection  although this level is most significant for the biology and evolution of viruses 
This study intends to fill this gap by evaluating the recombination frequency of the cauliflower mosaic virus  CaMV  during a single passage in one of its host plants  the turnip Brassica rapa CaMV is a pararetrovirus  which is a major grouping containing hepadnaviruses  e g  hepatitis B virus  badnaviruses  e g  banana streak virus  and caulimoviruses  e g  CaMV 
Pararetroviruses are characterized by a non segmented double stranded DNA genome 
After entering the host cell nucleus  the viral DNA accumulates as a minichromosome   whose transcription is ensured by the host RNA polymerase II   
The CaMV genome consists in approximately   bp and encodes six viral gene products that have been detected in planta  Figure     
Viral proteins P  to P  are expressed from two major transcripts  namely a  S RNA  encoding P  and a  S RNA corresponding to the entire genome and serving as mRNA for proteins P –P    
Using the pre genomic  S RNA as a matrix  the protein P   product of gene V  reverse transcribes the genome into genomic DNA that is concomitantly encapsidated   The detection of CaMV recombinants in turnip hosts has been reported numerous times 
Some studies have demonstrated the appearance of infectious recombinant viral genomes after inoculation  i  of a host plant with two infectious or non infectious parental clones   or  ii  of a transgenic plant containing one CaMV transgene with a CaMV genome missing the corresponding genomic region   
While the former revealed inter genomic viral recombination  the latter demonstrated that CaMV can also recombine with transgenes within the host s genome 
Another study based on phylogenetic analyses of various CaMV strains has clearly suggested different origins for different genomic regions and  hence  multiple recombination events during the evolution of this virus   
Indirect experimental evidence has indicated that  in some cases  CaMV recombination could occur within the host nucleus  between different viral minichromosomes  presumably through the action of the DNA repair cellular machinery   
Nevertheless  the mechanism of  template switching  during reverse transcription  predominant in all retroviruses  most certainly also applies to pararetroviruses 
For this reason  and on the basis of numerous experimental data  CaMV is generally believed to recombine mostly in the cytoplasm of the host cell  by  legal  template switching between two pre genomic RNA molecules    or  illegal  template switching between the  S and the  S RNA   
Under this hypothesis  recombination in CaMV could therefore be considered as operating on a linear template during reverse transcription  with the  ′ and  ′ extremities later ligated to circularize the genomic DNA  position   in Figure  
The above cited studies clearly demonstrate that CaMV is able to recombine 
However  since these studies are based on complementation techniques  non quantitative detection  or phylogenetically based inferences of recombination  they do not inform us on whether recombination is an exceptional event or an  everyday  process shaping the genetic composition of CaMV populations In the present work  we aimed at answering this question 
To this end  we have constructed a CaMV genome with four genetic markers  demonstrated to be neutral in competition experiments 
By co inoculating host plants with equal amounts of wild type and marker containing CaMV particles  we have generated mixed populations in which impressive proportions of recombinants distributed in several different classes corresponding to exchange of different genomic regions have been detected and quantified 
Altogether  the recombinant genomes averaged over   of the population 
Further analysis of these data  assuming a number of viral replications during the infection period ranging from five to   indicates that the per nucleotide per replication cycle recombination rate of CaMV is of the same order of magnitude  i e  on the order of a few   across the entire genome 
We thereby provide the first quantification  to our knowledge  of the recombination rate in a virus population during a single passage in a single host From Figure   and supposing that all marker containing genomic regions can recombine  we could predict the detection and quantification of seven classes of recombinant genotypes   bcd a  a cd b  ab d c  abc d   cd ab  a d bc  and a c b d 
Indeed  all classes were detected  and their frequencies in the ten CaMV populations analyzed are summarized in Table  Altogether  the proportion of recombinant genomes found in the mixed viral populations was astonishingly high and very similar in the ten co infected plants analyzed  Table   last column  ranging between    plant   to    plants     and   with a mean frequency   standard error  of      
This result indicates that recombination events are very frequent during the invasion of the host plant by CaMV and represents  to our knowledge  the first direct quantification of viral recombination during the infection of a live multi cellular host The inferred per generation recombination and interference rates  assuming that CaMV undergoes ten replication cycles during the   d between infection and sampling  are given for each of the ten plants in Table  
Recombination rates between adjacent markers are large  on the order of   to  
Taking the distance in nucleotides between markers into account yields an average recombination rate per nucleotide and generation on the order of      
Interestingly  this recombination rate does not vary throughout the genome  Kruskal–Wallis test  p    To relax the assumption of the number of replications during the   d  we calculated the recombination parameters assuming five or   generations 
The effect of the number of generations on the estimates is linear  doubling the number of generations results in a halving of the recombination rate  detailed results not shown 
For example  the average recombination rates r
  r
  and r
  assuming   generations were equal to     and   respectively  compare with values in Table   yielding per nucleotide per generation recombination rates of             and      Inspection of Table   also shows that first order interference coefficients were in general negative  indicating that a crossing over in one genomic segment increases the probability that a crossing over will occur in another genomic segment  while the second order coefficient parameter had an average value close to zero with a large variance 
The mechanism leading to these results will be discussed in the following section One major breakthrough in the work presented here lies in the space and time scales at which the experiments were performed 
Indeed  the processes occurring within the course of a single infection of one multi cellular host are of obvious biological relevance for any disease 
Previous studies on viral recombination suffered from major drawbacks in this respect  basing their conclusions on experiments relying on complementation among non infectious viruses or between viruses with undetermined relative fitness  on phylogenetically based analyses  or on experiments in cell cultures 
For reasons detailed in the Introduction  the first two methods either do not provide information on the frequency of recombination  but only its occurrence  or address the question at a different temporal  and often spatial  scale 
Results from cell cultures  on the other hand  impose cell co infection by different viral variants  potentially overestimating the frequency of recombination events 
Our study circumvents these limitations by analyzing viral genotypes sampled from infected plants after the course of a single infection  and therefore the invasion and co infection of cells in various organs and tissues is very close to natural More than half of the genomes       see Table   present in a CaMV population after a single passage in its host plant were identified as recombinants  and these data allowed us to infer a per nucleotide per generation recombination rate on the order of       to      
The time length of one generation  i e  the time required for a given genome to go from one replication to the next  is totally unknown in plant viruses 
The only experimental data available on CaMV are based on the kinetics of gene expression in infected protoplasts  where the capsid protein is produced between   and   h   
The reverse transcription and the encapsidation of genomic DNA being two coupled phenomena    we judged it reasonable to assume a generation time of   d and  thus  an average of ten generations during our experiments 
In case this estimate is mistaken  we have verified a linear relationship between r and the number of generations  thereby allowing an immediate adjustment of r if the CaMV generation time is more precisely established 
At this point  we must consider that all cloned genomes may not have been through all the successive replication events potentially allowed by the timing of our experiments 
It was previously shown that about   of CaMV mature virus particles accumulate in compact inclusion bodies    where they may be sequestered for a long time  as such inclusions are very frequent in all infected cells  including those in leaves that have been invaded by the virus population for several weeks 
The viral population may thus present an age structure that could bias the estimation of the recombination rate 
In order to minimize this bias  the clones we analyzed were collected in one young newly formed leaf  where the chances of finding genomes from  unsequestered lines  were assumed to be higher 
In any case  our data analysis is conservative  since this age structure can only lead to an underestimation of the recombination rate Our results show that interferences between pairs of loci are negative  a recombination event between two loci apparently increases the probability of recombination between another pair of loci 
We believe that the most parsimonious explanation of these negative interferences is based on the way the infection builds up within plant hosts 
Indeed  one can divide infected host cells into those infected by a single virus genotype and those infected by more than one viral genotype 
In the former  analogous to clonal propagation  recombination is undetectable 
In the latter  recombination is not only detectable but  as our results indicate  very frequent 
Samples consisting of viruses resulting from a mixture of these two types of host cell infections will thus contain viruses with no recombination and viruses with several recombination events  thus yielding an impression of negative interference 
These conceptual arguments are supported by mathematical models 
It is indeed easy to show  detailed results not shown  that if a proportion F of the population reproduces clonally  analogous to single infections  while the remaining reproduces panmictically  negative interferences could be inferred even if they do not exist 
For example  assuming a three locus model with real recombination rates r
  and r
  and interference i
  the  apparent  recombination and interference parameters  would be r
        F r  r
        F r
  and i
     F   i
    F 
Interestingly  this example also shows that our estimates of the recombination rate are conservative  that a fraction F of host cells are singly infected while others are multiply infected leads to an underestimation of the recombination rate As judged by r
  r
  and r
  calculated between markers a–b  b–c  and c–d  respectively  we found evidence for recombination through the entire CaMV genome 
The values for r
 
r
  and r
  are remarkably similar  hence the recombination sites seem to be evenly distributed along the genome 
We considered the template switching model as the major way recombinants are created in CaMV 
As already mentioned in the Introduction  hot spots of template switching have been predicted at the position of the  ′ extremities of the  S and  S RNAs   
If other recombination mechanisms  such as that associated with second strand DNA synthesis or with the host cell DNA repair machinery  act significantly  hot spots would be expected at the positions of the sequence interruption     and     
Due to the design of our experiment and the position of the four markers  we have no information on putative hot spots at positions corresponding to the  ′ end of the  S RNA and to    at nucleotide position  
Nevertheless  the putative hot spots at the  ′ end of the  S RNA and at   and    nucleotide positions   and   respectively  fall between marker pairs c–d  b–c  and a–b  respectively 
Our results indicate that either these hot spots are quantitatively equivalent though predicted by different recombination mechanisms or  more likely  that they simply do not exist 
Whatever the explanation  what we observe is that the CaMV can exchange any portion of its genome  and thus any gene thereof  with an astonishingly high frequency during the course of a single host infection To our knowledge  the viral recombination rate has never previously been quantified experimentally for a plant virus   
In contrast  retroviruses and particularly HIV  have been extensively investigated in that sense 
As we have already discussed for these latter cases  the quantification of the intrinsic recombination rate was carried out in artificially co infected cell cultures 
The estimated intrinsic per nucleotide per generation recombination rate in HIV  is on the order of      less than one order of magnitude higher than our estimation for CaMV 
Because for various reasons detailed above we probably underestimate the within host CaMV recombination rate  we believe that the intrinsic recombination rate in CaMV is higher and perhaps on the order of that of HIV Other pararetroviruses such as plant badnaviruses or vertebrate hepadnaviruses have a similar cycle within their host cells  including steps of nuclear minichromosome  genomic size RNA synthesis  and reverse transcription and encapsidation 
Nevertheless  vertebrate hepadnaviruses  e g  hepatitis B virus  infect hosts that are very different from plants in their biology and physiology  and this could lead to a totally different frequency of cell co infection during the development of the virus populations 
Thus  even though our results can be informative for other pararetroviruses because of the viruses  shared biological characteristics  they should not be extrapolated to vertebrate pararetroviruses without caution We used the plasmid pCa  which is the complete genome of the CaMV isolate Cabb S  cloned into the pBR  plasmid at the unique SalI restriction site   
To analyze recombination in different regions of the genome  we introduced four genetic markers  a  b  c  and d  at the positions       and   respectively  thus approximately at four cardinal points of the CaMV circular double stranded DNA of   bp  Figure  
All markers  each corresponding to a single nucleotide change  were introduced by PCR directed mutagenesis in pCa  and resulted in the duplication of previously unique restriction sites BsiWI  PstI  MluI  and SacI in a plasmid designated pMark S  Because  in this study  we targeted the possible exchange of genes between viral genomes  all markers a  b  c  and d were introduced within coding regions corresponding to open reading frames I  IV  V  and VI  respectively 
Another important concern was to quantify recombination in the absence of selection  i e  to create neutral markers 
Consequently all markers consist of synonymous mutations  see below To generate the parental virus particles  plasmids pCa  and pMark S were mechanically inoculated into individual plants as previously described   
All plants were turnips  B  rapa cv   Just Right  grown under glasshouse conditions at   °C with a    light dark  photoperiod 
Thirty days post inoculation  all symptomatic leaves were harvested and viral particles were purified as described earlier   The resulting preparations of parental viruses  designated Cabb S and Mark S  were quantified by spectrometry using the formula described by Hull et al 
  
We fixed the initial frequency of markers to a value of   and a solution containing   mg ml of virus particles of both Cabb S and Mark S at a   ratio was prepared 
Plantlets were co infected by mechanical inoculation of two to three leaves with   μl of this virus solution  using abrasive Celite AFA  Fluka  Ronkonkoma  New York  United States 
The mixed CaMV population was allowed to grow during   d of systemic infection We designed an experimental protocol for quantifying marker frequency within a mixed Cabb S Mark S virus population after a single passage in a host plant 
Twenty four individual plants  inoculated as above with equal amounts of Cabb S and Mark S  were harvested   d post inoculation  when symptoms were fully developed 
The viral DNA was purified from   mg of young newly formed infected leaves according to the protocol described previously   
After the precipitation step of this protocol  the viral DNA was resuspended and further purified with the Wizard DNA clean up kit  Promega  Fitchburg  Wisconsin  United States  in TE  X   mM Tris HCl and   mM EDTA  pH   
Aliquots of viral DNA preparations were digested by restriction enzymes corresponding either to marker a  b  c  or d and submitted to a   agarose gel electrophoresis  colored by ethydium bromide and exposed to UV 
Each individual restriction enzyme cut once in Cabb S DNA and twice in Mark S  thus generating DNA fragments of different sizes attributable to one or the other in the mixed population of CaMV genomes 
After scanning the agarose gels  we estimated the relative frequency of the two genotypes in each viral DNA preparation and at each marker position  by densitometry using the NIH   Image program 
The statistical analyses of the frequency of the four markers are described below To identify and quantify the recombinants within the CaMV mixed populations  aliquots from ten of the   viral DNA preparations described above were digested by the restriction enzyme SalI  and directly cloned into pUC  at the corresponding site 
In each of the ten viral populations analyzed    full genome length clones were digested separately by BsiWI  PstI  MluI  and SacI  to test for the presence of marker a  b  c  and d  respectively 
In this experiment  with the marker representing an additional restriction site  we could easily distinguish between the Cabb S and the Mark S genotype at all four marker positions  upon agarose gel   electrophoresis of the digested clones 
Clones with none or all four markers were parental genotypes  whereas clones harboring     or   markers were clearly recombinants 
Due to the very high number of recombinants detected  markers eventually appearing or disappearing due to spontaneous mutations were neglected Here we present the different methods we used to quantify recombination in the CaMV genome 
Because all these methods assume that the different markers are neutral  we first discuss assumption We used two datasets to test the neutrality of markers  both resulting from plants co infected with a   ratio of Mark S and Cabb S 
The first consisted of viral DNA densitometry data derived from   plants  described above  where for each plant we have an estimate of the frequency of each marker in the genome population 
The second consisted of the restriction of   individual full genome length viral clones obtained from one co infected plant  described above  yielding an estimate of the frequency of each marker  and this was repeated on ten different plants 
The frequencies of the different markers were       and   for markers a  b  c  and d in the first dataset and       and   in the second dataset 
We tested whether these frequencies were significantly different from the expected value under neutrality    using either t tests  for datasets where normality could not be rejected  seven out of eight cases  or Wilcoxon signed rank non parametric tests otherwise  marker c in the first dataset 
In all cases p values were larger than  There are several cautionary remarks regarding these analyses 
First  in all cases we found an excess of markers 
Unfortunately  the two datasets cannot be regarded as independent because  even though the methods through which the frequency estimates were obtained were different  the plants used in the second dataset were a subset of the plants of the first 
We thus have only four independent estimates in each case  and there is minimal power to detect significant deviations from neutrality with such a small sample size 
It should be noted at this stage that deviations from the expected value could also be caused either by slight deviations from the   ratio in the infecting mixed solution  or by deviations from that ratio in the frequency of the viral particles that actually get into the plants 
Second  because of the relatively small sample sizes and low statistical power  the tests presented above could have detected only large deviations The results clearly show  however  precisely that the markers do not have large effects  if any  and that therefore recombination estimates would be affected only very slightly by any hypothetical selective effects of the markers 
Because of this  along with the fact that the introduced markers provoke silent substitutions in the CaMV genome  we assumed that markers were effectively neutral in the rest of the analysis The dataset used to estimate the recombination frequency consisted of the   full genome length viral clones   from each of ten co infected plants  individually genotyped for each of the four markers 
As discussed in detail in the Results  recombination was very frequent and concerned all four markers 
Indeed  approximately half of the genotyped clones exhibited a recombinant genotype 
It was therefore meaningful to try to obtain quantitative estimates of recombination from our data Our aim was to analyze viral recombination in a live host 
Consequently  we had to deal with the fact that more than one viral replication cycle occurred during the   d that infection lasted in our experiment  we had to wait that long for the disease to develop and to be able to recover sufficient amounts of viral DNA from each infection 
Based on the kinetics of gene expression    we postulate that each replication cycle lasts between   and   d  and that therefore seven to ten cycles occurred between infection and the sampling time 
In case this assumption is incorrect  we did calculations assuming five  seven  ten  or   replication cycles during these   d  As shown  the results were not affected qualitatively  and only slightly quantitatively 
It is important to note that we assumed that recombination occurred through a template switching mechanism  and that therefore  from a recombination point of view  the CaMV genome is linear 
The reverse transcription starts and finishes at the position   in Figure   which is the point of circularization of the DNA genome 
This implies that changes between contiguous markers a–b  b–c  and c–d can be considered as true recombination whereas those between a and d cannot  as they may simply stem from circularization of DNA  during the synthesis of which the polymerase has switched template once anywhere between a–b  b–c  or c–d To estimate the recombination rate between markers  we wrote recurrence equations describing the change in frequency of each genotype over one generation  assuming random mating and no selection  i e  the standard Wright–Fisher population genetics model 
We then expressed the frequency of all possible genotypes n generations later as a function of their initial frequency and of the recombination parameters 
Subsequently we calculated the maximum likelihood estimates of the recombination parameters and their asymptotic variances given initial frequencies  we assumed that the two  parental  genotypes  Mark S and Cabb S  had equal initial frequencies of   and that all other genotypes had initial frequencies of zero  and frequencies after n generations  the observed frequencies  as stated above we used different values of n 
All algebraic and numerical calculations were carried out with the software Mathematica The recombination parameters are the recombination rates between two adjacent loci  e g  r
  for the recombination rate between markers a and b  and the interference coefficients  e g  i
  for interference between recombination events in the segments between markers a and b and b and c  To define these parameters we followed Christiansen    and in particular the recombination distributions for two  three  and four loci  respectively  Tables     and   of   
It is important to realize that given the definitions of these parameters  the estimator of the recombination rate between two loci is not affected by the number of loci considered 
In other words  we obtain the same estimation of the recombination rate between markers a and b whether we consider genotypic frequencies at just these two loci  or the frequencies at these two loci plus a third locus  or the complete information to which we have access  the four marker genotypes 
Information on additional loci only affects the estimates of the interference coefficients It proved impossible to carry out the calculations for four loci algebraically 
Instead  we used a computer program to calculate the expected genotypic frequencies at all four loci after n generations  given the above stated initial frequencies and specified recombination parameters 
For each combination of recombination parameters we calculated a Euclidean distance between the vector of the expected genotypic frequencies and the observed genotypic frequencies  and considered that the estimated recombination parameters were those yielding the minimal Euclidean distance 
In all cases  the estimated recombination rates between pairs of loci were equal to the second decimal to those estimated algebraically from data for three or two loci Tumor Restrictions to Oncolytic VirusIn most solid tumors the tumor interior displays a high cellular density with multiple cell types  both malignant and normal  stromal  cells  interdigitated by strands of extracellular matrix  ECM  and other poorly defined tissue 
Stromal cells typically consist of fibroblasts  macrophages  neutrophils and other immune cell types 
Tumor associated fibroblasts are a source of the bulk acellular tissue in tumors    which is largely made up of polysugars and glycoproteins  such as collagens  laminins  fibronectins  proteoglycans  hyaluronan and water  forming a dense matrix around and between the cancer cells   
This matrix provides structural support but also haptotactic and chemotactic guidance for cancer cells   
Moreover  the prevailing tumor interstitium is rich in soluble angiogenic factors  such as members of the vascular endothelial growth factor  VEGF  family    cellular growth factors  including endothelial growth factor  EGF  basic fibroblast growth factor  FGF  platelet derived growth factor  PDGF  and pleiotrophic factors  particularly transforming growth factor  TGF  beta   
Additionally  both tumor  and stromal cells secrete cytokines and chemokines  such as interleukin  IL    IL   tumor necrosis factor  TNF  alpha  stromal cell derived factor  SDF    macrophage migration inhibitory factor  MIF    which on one hand recruit more stromal and progenitor cells into the tumors and on the other hand curb the activity of antigen presenting cells and anti tumor T cells   
In several independent cancer types  high serum levels of IL   and IL   are indicators of poor prognosis   Aberrant tumor and stromal growth combined with an overproduction of matrix leads to high interstitial pressure in the tumor  preventing lateral diffusion of therapeutic compounds within the tumor 
Tight cellular compactness combined with a high tumor proliferation rate also causes physical crowding and puts constraints on oxygenation  which due to aberrant angiogenesis and rupture of the haphazard vessels is mostly incomplete and results in chronic tissue hypoxia toward the tumor cores 
As cancer cells exist in a crowding hypoxic  and cytokine growth factor perpetuated chronic state of stress  they upregulate a number of key cellular molecules that function as a collective defense against a wide range of therapies  including oncolytic viruses 
The properties of oncolytic viruses and their status in clinical development as well as various delivery options have been reviewed elsewhere   
In this review  we provide an overview of two of the main intratumoral barriers to oncolytic virus spread  the extracellular tumor make up and the intracellular antiviral defense mechanisms Tumor cellular structure and composition may in concert with abundant extracellular matrix  ECM  deposition pose a severe hurdle for systemic virus entry and propagation of infection within the tumor 
The extracellular matrix is a complex dense network consisting of multiple proteins  glycoproteins and polysaccharides including collagens  laminins  fibronectins  proteoglycans and hyaluronic acid   
The interstitial fluid pressure  IFP  in the tumor surrounding blood and lymphatic vessels is mainly created by the high cell density that forms an increased physical pressure outwards and does not allow free diffusion of therapeutics   
A high IFP generally predicts an aggressive tumor phenotype as tumor cells tend to escape from tumor margins where the pressure drops  thus facilitating spread of metastatic cells   
On the other hand  for therapeutic virus  interstitial fluid concentration gradients may pose a hurdle as passive diffusion in viable regions  typically the rim  may occur mainly outward   
Given the limited arsenal of known chemicals alleviating tumor compactness and the poor penetration drugs in general into the tumor tissue  this is a considerable problem that may not be easy to tackle 
Some strategies are discussed below Viruses are passive particles and rely either on radial cell to cell spread or on soluble diffusion across concentration gradients to reach their target cells and to propagate the infection 
Tumor matrix is critical in this regard  as it can block both forms of spread 
Passively diffusing viruses may physically not fit through the strands of the ECM 
This was shown for oncolytic herpes virus  which has an outer diameter of over   nm  and whose spreading could be improved by matrix degrading bacterial collagenase co injection   
Bilbao and coworkers showed that adenovirus entry into experimental hepatocellular carcinoma nodules in the livers of immunocompetent rats following intravenous or intraportal injection was directly related to the thickness of the ECM capsule enveloping the nodules   
On the other hand  we found using Semliki Forest virus  which has an outer diameter of about   nm  that even upon intratumoral injection spread was blocked by ECM  which formed a physical barrier for virus infection  Figure  The foremost option to reduce interstitial fluid pressure and to remove physical molecule barriers imposed by the ECM is to use matrix degrading enzymes 
These act by digesting collagen  fibrin  and other types of fibrillar matrix deposits  creating more space between cell clusters  and glycosaminoglycan polymers  known to limit fluid movement in tumors 
Simultaneously  such strategies may also expose more cell surface to viruses  increasing the likelihood of infection 
In a study by Kuriyama  trypsin or collagenase dispase was injected into subcutaneous U  and U  glioma xenografts in immunocompromised mice  followed by a reporter adenovirus   
Both types of ECM degrading enzymes increased tumor transduction by the virus  but when doses got too high  transduction efficacy suffered  demonstrating a balance between ECM degradation and oncolytic virus efficacy 
In another study  treatment of PC  tumors with vaccinia virus producing matrix metalloprotease  MMP    resulted in reduction of collagen IV fibrils and increase in virus penetration into tumor  which yielded elevated virus titers   
Hong et al 
targeted orthotopic neuroblastoma xenografts engineered to express MMP  with oncolytic HSV  achieving increased virus distribution compared to control tumors   
Similar results were obtained when human soft tissue sarcoma HSTS T overexpressing MMP  or MMP  were injected with oncolytic HSV   
MMP expressing tumors contained significantly less sulfated glycosaminoglycans compared to control tumors 
Other enzymes and protein effectors  either engineered into virus expression cassettes or provided exogenously  include hyaluronidase  decorin  various other MMPs  and notably relaxin a peptide hormone normally expressed during particular phase of pregnancy that does not possess tissue degrading activity itself  but instead induces a number of key collagen degrading proteases seemingly in a tumor specific manner   
Beyer showed that relaxin expressed by murine stem cells improved trastuzumab penetrance and therapy outcome in syngeneic tumor models   
In another study  chimeric adenovirus Ad  expressing relaxin showed increased tumor transduction and virus dissemination   Several other strategies to increase penetration of therapeutics in tumors have been developed   
While the stromal ECM capsule of tumor nodules acts as a physical barrier to virus entry following intravenous injection  it was possible to improve tumor infection by administering vaso active compounds  angiotensin II  histamine  nitroglycerine  before the virus   
This is interesting  as vasculature per se would not be expected to alter or influence the physical composition of the ECM  such as collagen strand thickness 
Instead  virus access to the tumor was improved  most likely by increased access from the blood via tumor stromal adjoining vessels 
Interestingly  in a study with oncolytic herpes virus  anti VEGF monoclonal antibody Bevacizumab given before intravenous virus injection gave poorer anti tumor efficacy than when given after the virus   
The study showed that while HSV is able to enter and infect tumors better through their leaky vasculature compared to Bevacizumab normalized vasculature  vascular normalization by Bevacizumab still gave superior combination efficacy when the virus was already in the tumor 
This effect was likely dependent on altering both physical and biological properties of the tumor  including interstitial pressure and oxygenation 
In another study  anti VEGF A antibody injections in nude mice harboring U  human glioma xenografts led to an increase in MMP  expression and reduction in collagen fiber content  facilitating improved distribution of oncolytic adenovirus within the tumor tissue   
In general  targeting tumor vasculature by oncolytic viruses and including agents that affect tumor vasculature in combination regimens is gaining interest    and it will be interesting to see more specific studies on how vascular acting agents may affect the physical barriers to oncolytic viruses Some viruses do not need an extracellular step for propagating infection  such as members of the herpes and poxvirus families  and may be able to spread from cell to cell 
For example  HSV  is able to infect neighboring cells via lateral tight junctions in a manner dependent on its glycoproteins E and I   
Vaccinia virus  on the other hand  induces so called actin tails  which are actin filament driven membranous protrusions of the plasma membrane harboring a single virus particle at the outer tip 
These actin tails actively deliver and deposit virus particles onto or even into neighboring cells   
Because lateral spread without an extracellular step may circumvent neutralizing immunity as well as some of the physical obstacles the tumor microenvironment imposes  this ability has been engineered into viruses that normally do not possess it 
A promising strategy is to engineer OVs to express membrane fusogenic genes  MFGs  such as gibbon ape leukemia virus  GALV  glycoprotein  reptilian reovirus p  protein  FAST  or the membrane glycoproteins H and F of measles virus   
Quite intriguingly  expression of several different MFGs by oncolytic adenovirus synergized with chemotherapy in anti tumor efficacy both in vitro and in vivo    suggesting that membrane fusion facilitated lateral spread of also chemotherapeutics  which otherwise would not have occurred in a compact tumor 
The potential limitation of cell to cell dependent spread  however  may be that membrane free physical barriers  such as the ECM  may still pose a barrier to spread 
Also  it is unclear whether MFGs or other mechanisms of lateral spread may assist in reaching distant tumor nests Some other strategies to alleviate matrix imposed restrictions to oncolytic viruses have been discussed elsewhere   Tumors of epithelial origin mostly retain the firm cellular integrity seen in their original adhesive intercellular configuration 
Several viruses use cellular receptors which are located in paracellular tight junctions  which may be problematic in tightly packed tumors   
Adenovirus C group viruses use coxsackie adenovirus receptor  CAR  as their primary entry point  whereas adenovirus B  group members and measles virus Edmonston use CD  complement binding molecule as their cellular receptor   
Adenovirus B  group  serotypes       and   entry occurs using desmoglein   DSG    
Of these  CAR and DSG  are preferentially located within tight junctions and are hidden from virus binding   
Also the complement receptor CD  was ascribed a role in maintenance of epithelial cell integrity by interactions with the E cadherin catenin network   
These observations imply that before reaching the potential entry site on the tumor cell the virus must find its way into the junctional space 
Moreover  it has become increasingly clear that for example glioma tumors traditionally targeted by Ad  serotype adenoviruses often express only low levels of CAR and instead much higher levels of CD    Beyond that tight junctions hide multiple virus receptors  they contain a network of adhesion molecules  including ZO  cadherins  claudins and occludin  which  if perturbed  is associated with more aggressive disease in many types of cancer   
Since tight junctions also contain important receptors that mediate tumor promoting signaling and which have been targeted by monoclonal antibodies  notably Her  it would be highly useful to develop strategies that temporarily loosen the tight junction contacts even at cost of a transient increase in tumor metastatic risk 
One of the most interesting approaches has been to exploit the natural propensity of adenovirus serotype   which as part of its natural life cycle creates dodecahedral particles  PtDd  consisting of viral capsid proteins  penton base and fiber that open tight junctions by binding to and dissolving desmoglein  dimers and reducing E cadherin expression  to develop a specific tight junction opening molecule  JO    
Adenovirus type   uses PtDds to promote its own infection  opening the tight junctions ahead of infection to maximize access to desmoglein 
Analogously  when administered to human tumor xenografts  JO  facilitated penetration of trastuzumab much deeper into the tumor tissue than when the monoclonal antibody was administered on its own   
Moreover  JO  synergized with several chemotherapeutics in solid tumor models   
Backed by our own findings with oncolytic SFV  showing that both extracellular matrix and tumor cell compactness restrict virus spread and oncolytic efficacy  we believe combination approaches that target both tight junctions and extracellular matrix will prove effective in future virotherapy development  Figure  An alternative approach to increasing tumor penetration by oncolytic viruses is to alter tumor cell morphology and status 
Notably  cell death and in particular the type of cell death induced by virus has been shown to affect virus distribution within a tumor mass  in a study by Nagano et al  administration of apoptosis inducing paclitaxel before injecting oncolytic herpes simplex virus increased virus dissemination in the tumor  allowing its diffuse in  tunnels  created by shrinking dying tumor cells   Maintenance of physiological adherence is essential for proper ECM function and for retaining cellular integrity 
Therefore  a potential caveat of using ECM degrading proteolytic enzymes or tight junction openers is the risk of neoplastic cell detachment from the tumor ECM and increased risk of metastasis 
While ECM degradation or tight junction opening may operate innocuously  there is also a chance that loss of E cadherins via proteases or via non specific deregulation of tight junction integrity during ECM modulating therapy could trigger pro tumorigenic Wnt β catenin signaling  possibly driving epithelial to mesenchymal transition   
One study showed that ectopic relaxin expression stimulated MMP expression and enhanced breast cancer invasiveness    whereas another paper found short term relaxin exposure to increase breast cancer cell motility whereas long term expression reduced both motility and cancer invasiveness   
In the context of oncolytic viruses  Lavilla Alonso tested several proteases  including hyaluronidase  relaxin  and macrophage metalloelastase  and showed they all could assist adenovirus entry into tumors  yet  the authors did not detect treatment induced metastases or increase in tumor invasiveness   
Another strategy possibly balancing some of the putative risks of tight junction disruption could be to use Wnt dependent oncolytic viruses   Tumors are invariably fenestrated by host fibroblasts  myeloid cells and other non transformed cells  which driven by cancer induced cues can adopt various reprogrammed phenotypes to promote tumor angiogenesis and growth and to alter tumor responses to therapies   
As most of them normally play a role in immune homeostasis and pathogen sensing  they also respond to and influence oncolytic virus infection of tumors Fulci et al 
reported that injection of oncolytic HSV  directly into glioblastoma tumor parenchyma triggered upregulation of CD  and CD  monocytic markers and rapid clearance of virus  likely executed by infiltrating phagocytic cells   
When clodronate liposomes were used to deplete macrophages in vivo  the authors observed a  fold increase in virus titers in the brain tumors concomitant with an   reduction in peripheral CD  macrophages in animal spleens  suggesting that CD  cells migrate into the tumors upon virus injection and limit overall oncolytic efficacy 
While CD  cells were not reduced by peripheral macrophage depletion  arguing that these cells had been recruited to the tumors before the treatment  they could be eliminated in live glioma slices ex vivo  resulting in a  fold increase in virus replication 
Macrophages may secrete antiviral type I interferon constitutively at very low  subnanomolar  levels   and recently Liu et al 
showed that tumor resident CD  macrophages induced a protective antiviral state in ovarian and breast tumors which led to resistance to oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus  VSV  infection   
Type I IFN signaling  JAK  inhibitor Ruxolitinib reversed the resistance  facilitating VSV replication in the macrophage protected cancer cells 
It is tempting to speculate that tumor resident macrophages also rendered syngeneic GL  and DBT mouse gliomas completely refractory to VA  oncolytic alphavirus  as these cells were quite infectable in vitro and live glioma slices regained their sensitivity to virus within   h  indicating dilution of IFN I   Macrophages or the closely related myeloid suppressor cells are the predominant stromal cell type in many tumors and are actively recruited during cancer progression   
Heavy macrophage presence in the tumors indicates that such tumors may be resistant to oncolytic virotherapy  unless depleting preconditioning would be used 
Moreover  as part of the early immune response to virus infection  monocytic cells are rapidly recruited to tumors following intratumoral virus injection 
In one study  depletion of either CD b  cells or VEGF secreted by these cells in mice treated with oncolytic HSV  greatly increased oncolytic efficacy  tentatively linking pro tumorigenic and antiviral angiogenic mechanisms   Another key pro tumorigenic signaling employed by many tumors is up regulation of CXCR  the receptor for chemokine CXCL   also known as SDF  and recruitment of stromal cells expressing CXCL  which maintain the tumor and recruit additional cells to support tumor expansion and invasion  such as endothelial cell progenitors which contribute to neovascularization   
Indeed  high CXCR  expression is a negative prognostic factor for many cancers 
Oncolytic vaccinia virus engineered to express a soluble antagonist of CXCR  showed improved intratumoral virus replication  increased vascular disruption and a markedly reduced infiltration of the tumors by putative immune suppressive and tumor promoting stromal cells   
This study highlights how reducing pro tumor stromal cell effects may alleviate antiviral resistance and yield increased overall therapeutic efficacy 
On the other hand  if the paracrine antiviral effects of tumor homing monocytic cells could be selectively abrogated these cells could favorably be used to ferry oncolytic viruses into tumors 
Indeed  a significant delay in metastatic tumor potential was achieved when macrophages were harnessed to deliver a tumor specific oncolytic adenovirus   What is the antiviral status in human cancer 
Recent analyses from different normal cells that occupy the same organ reveal striking functional variation in components of the type I IFN signaling pathway that correlate with the tissue tropism and virulence of some virus strains   
Can similar variation in such components be found in cancer cells  or do cancer cells make an exception Transformed cells undergo selective elimination by the immune system before becoming cancerous  termed immunoediting  based on observations of differential capacity of immunocompetent mice to reject tumors previously grown in immunocompromised hosts versus syngeneic animals   
Cancer cell responsiveness to type I and type II IFNs plays a role during immunoediting  cancer cells that eventually progress to form a tumor display reduced capacity to respond to IFN gamma  which otherwise would upregulate MHC class I molecules and render the tumors amenable to CD  T cell mediated destruction  whereas responsiveness to type I interferon initially helps tumors avoid immune purging during the editing phase and is then irrelevant   
Of note  the anti tumor effects of type I IFN  still exploited today in several cancers  were shown to depend on host NK cells  and mice in which IFNAR was blocked by monoclonal antibody failed to reject even highly immunogenic tumors  as opposed to mice treated with control antibody  who all rejected the immunogenic tumor challenge   
Thus  whereas tumor responsiveness to type I IFN is not predetermined after immunoediting  other factors post immunoediting may influence it In several tumor types  varying levels of expression of components of the type I IFN signaling cascade have been detected  and in some tumor types these components have been found to have prognostic value  whereas in others they do not seem to influence survival   
However  emerging data suggests that antiviral genes may predict poor survival because they increase treatment resistance 
In one study  poor prognosis of several types of cancer due to genotoxic treatment resistance was found to correlate with increased activity of IFN I pathway genes   
In this study  a triad of type I IFN signaling pathway genes  STAT  ISG  and IFIT  formed a pan tumor type negative prognostic factor  and a broader seven gene cluster established negative prognostic criteria for treatment resistant breast cancer 
Treatment resistance was subsequently shown to depend on STAT  signaling  STAT expressing tumor clones were positively selected in animals in vivo  demonstrating increased proliferation and metastatic potential  and STAT expression mediated resistance against genotoxic assault by doxorubicin or ionizing radiation  knockdown of STAT  resulted in lower proliferation rate and metastatic capacity and increased sensitivity to genotoxic stress    
In another study  resistance to epigenetic DNA modifiers  AZA dC  a methyltransferase inhibitor  and LBH  or MGCD  both histone deacetylase  HDAC  inhibitors  was correlated with increased expression of IFN I pathway genes in small lung cancer cells   
Basal IFN related gene expression in several different SML cell lines was upregulated Interestingly  in many cancers  STAT proteins are not phosphorylated and persist in unphosphorylated form  U STAT 
Like its phosphorylated counterpart  U STAT  increases expression of genes contributing to resistance to DNA damaging agents   
While it is currently unknown why cancers may prefer to use unphosphorylated forms  it is known that U STATs activate distinct signals compared to their phosphorylated counterparts 
However  importantly for oncolytic viruses  in many tumors  constant expression and release of type I IFN leads to a constitutively high level of unphosphorylated forms of STAT  STAT  and IRF  which together form an unphosphorylated but functional ISGF like complex that relocalizes to the nucleus and drives expression of a specific set of ISGs distinct from acute IFN I exposure   
These ISGs are sufficient to maintain a functional antiviral defense and they play a critical role in resistance to DNA damaging agents On a cellular level  virus replication is controlled by antiviral defense molecules    which in turn are primarily controlled by type I IFN signaling 
In addition to classical type I IFN  or cytokine induced antiviral signaling  tumors may employ other antiviral defense mechanisms 
For example  stromal cells may secrete peptides with antiviral properties called defensins   
The defensins are amphiphatic and typically  –  amino acids in length and interfere with viruses by physically binding to and disrupting virus particles and or by inducing antiviral responses in target cells via pattern recognition receptors 
At least oral squamous cell carcinomas were found to overexpress defensins compared to normal control tissues   
While the role of defensins in oncolytic virus infection of tumors is unclear  one study showed that the immune stimulating properties of defensins may be exploited to increase overall therapeutic efficacy 
In this study  expression of beta   defensin from a conditionally replicating adenovirus yielded a superior therapeutic entity compared to the unarmed parental virus via enhanced anti tumor immune responses mediated by TLR dependent activation of dendritic cells   In summary  human cancers display varying degrees of expression of antiviral proteins or their signaling regulators at baseline 
Some of these may increase in response to genotoxic anti cancer treatments 
In the next chapter we will highlight some of the consequences to oncolytic virotherapy of the heterogeneity in type I IFN responsiveness in tumor cells All oncolytic viruses tested to date display variable infectivity in different cancer cell lines 
This variability is likely at least partly dependent on type I IFN as most oncolytic viruses are IFN sensitive 
IFN secretion follows virus sensing by the cells via Toll like receptors expressed on both the plasma membrane and in endocytotic vesicles  NOD like receptors  STING  AIM  NLP inflammosome and other danger sensing molecules  summarized elsewhere   
While all viruses carry an arsenal of counteracting molecules    no virus goes completely undetected 
Even HSV amplicons  which are devoid of functional virus genes  induce a type I IFN response that mediates a STAT dependent system wide antiviral defense in mice within one hour of intravenous vector injection  resulting in significant reduction of transgene expression compared to expression in STAT  knockout animals   During our own studies with attenuated SFV vector VA  it became apparent that the dramatic and lasting therapeutic efficacy achieved following mere single intravenous  or intratumoral  injection of the virus in immunocompromised mice bearing human A  melanoma or U  glioma xenografts   was not going to be recapitulated easily in immunocompetent animals   
The paradox in our studies was that while oncolytic SFV vector VA  effectively replicated in and destroyed a variety of IFN responsive cancer cell lines in vitro  it consistently failed to eradicate tumors generated from the same cell types in vivo  even if large doses of virus were injected directly into the tumor mass and even if the tumors were void of visible physical barriers  Figure  
Conversely  only tumors generated from IFN unresponsive cancer cells have seemed infectable in vivo by VA  so far 
In light of earlier findings by others  showing that type I IFN receptor knockout mice are highly susceptible to SFV infection and quickly succumb to multi organ systemic infection    the parameters for oncolytic SFV efficacy seem clear  tumor cells must be defective in type I IFN response for the virus to be effective These findings are in line with emerging data from other groups  showing a remarkably strict dependence of oncolytic virus replication on defective type I IFN responsiveness  a dogma introduced at the turn of the  st century   
For example  sarcomas and melanomas display differing permissiveness to oncolytic VSV  an obstacle which may be overcome by blocking type I IFN signaling   
In eight sarcoma cell lines  basal up regulation of RIG I and IFIT  and rapid induction of STAT  phosphorylation upon IFN I treatment correlated with resistance to oncolytic measles virus   
In other studies  human pancreatic and ovarian cancer cells display resistance against Rb dependent oncolytic adenovirus  strongly correlating with intracellular levels of MxA  and acquired resistance to repeated oncolytic adenovirus injections in an intraperitoneal ovarian carcinoma model was associated with an increase in MxA as well as several other key ISGs in the tumors   
A study comparing normal human or mouse melanocytes to a panel of melanoma cells revealed strong correlation between permissiveness to oncolytic VSV and capacity to mount antiviral defense in response to type I IFN   
In this study  VSV rp  harboring two mutations in P and L genes  was superior to several other tested oncolytic VSV strains  but the dependence on defective IFN responsiveness was still retained 
In yet another study  oncolytic VSV replicated in four out of twelve mesothelioma cell lines which were unable to mount antiviral defense upon IFN beta pretreatment or to respond to infection by up regulation of PKR  MxA or  OAS mRNA   
In contrast  the non permissive mesothelioma cells mounted antiviral defense  associated with PKR  MxA or  OAS mRNA up regulation  in response to infection or to exogenous type I IFN 
The authors of this study further linked the observed pattern of virus resistance to clinical mesothelioma samples  where in a mesothelioma tissue array  significant variance in immunoreactivity against PKR  p  and or IFNAR was observed  with only a few samples displaying lack of reactivity against all three components  arguing that most tumors in clinical settings would display at least some level of resistance to oncolytic VSV Oncolytic adenoviruses are often deleted for E A  which normally binds Rb and prevents it from sequestering E F  which results in the viruses being unable to replicate in normal cells 
However  since adenovirus  as with all viruses  contains elements that antagonize antiviral defenses  such elements have also been targets for deletion to render the virus sensitive to innate antiviral defenses  which would be expected to remain intact only in normal cells 
Cancer cells expressing Ras may down regulate protein kinase R and inhibit type I IFN induction by interfering with RIG I signaling   
Also  select interferon stimulated genes appear to be repressed by the Ras MEK ERK signaling cascade   
PKR activation shuts down E F dependent translation  including translation of virus messenger RNAs 
Therefore  an adenovirus deleted for VA RNA  which antagonizes PKR  should be capable of replicating in Ras overexpressing  tumor  cells 
However  while this was seemingly the case    it was later discovered that Ras is not an obligatory determinant for PKR inactivation and that virus replication was halted even in Ras overexpressing cells via functional PKR mediated E F phosphorylation  implying that the parameters of VA RNA deleted adenovirus replication had to be revised   
Similar findings were obtained with oncolytic reovirus  against which Ras independent tumor resistance emerged in vivo   
Thus  under some circumstances even tumor cells over expressing Ras may respond to type I IFN or to stimulants of pattern recognition receptors  activating PKR and inhibiting virus translation 
To complicate matters  MEK inhibitors have been shown restore antiviral signaling capacity in Ras overexpressing tumors   
This implies that human tumors treated with MEK inhibitors  such as Trametinib which was recently approved for treatment of BRAF mutated melanoma  may be poor targets for oncolytic viruses as antiviral signaling capacity in such tumors may be restored Some oncolytic viruses  such as members of the poxvirus family  are seemingly resistant to the antiviral effects of type I IFNs in vitro and may be controlled by other cellular factors   
However  in most cases  sensitivity or resistance to type I IFN is assessed in vitro and using only one cytokine  which may mask synergies with other factors present in vivo 
One possible explanation for the in vitro–in vivo discrepancy is the tumor micro environment  which not only imposes physical barriers to oncolytic viruses but also alters intracellular antiviral defenses 
For example  glioma cells were found in the brain to spontaneously secrete type I IFN  which conferred resistance against oncolytic HSV 
Resistance was linked to ECM protein CCN  interaction with glioma cell surface receptor alpha   beta   integrin  which activated interferon secretion   
It is tempting to speculate whether this or a similar ECM glioma interaction could have contributed to the resistance of syngeneic glioma cells we observed in vivo but not in vitro to both oncolytic SFV and vaccinia virus  FIG    
Also  while critical in many respects  antiviral signaling may occur without signaling via type I IFN receptor  IFNAR 
For instance  upon infection of IFNAR KO mice with murine hepatitis virus  MHV  brain cells were found to have upregulated antiviral GTPase TGTP and IFITm  and IFITm  all of which have confirmed antiviral activity in vivo against a variety of viruses   
In these cases  IFN gamma and TNF alpha likely account for at least part of the observed ISG activity  where e g  TGTP is upregulated by IFN γ signaling and TNFα has been shown to induce ISG  independently of IFNAR   Interestingly  while most cancers are heterogeneous in antiviral defence signaling  one broad class of tumors in particular may display consistently low capacity to ward off oncolytic viruses  oncovirus induced cancers 
This is because oncoviruses  as all viruses  carry a complement of factors that abrogate antiviral sensors and effectors  which may result in tumors that are uniformly devoid of antiviral signaling 
In an intriguing study  oncolytic VSV infected and destroyed human papilloma virus  HPV positive cervical carcinoma cells more effectively than HPV negative head  and neck cancer cells due to HPV E mediated suppression of antiviral signaling   
HPV positive or E expressing xenografts were efficiently eradicated from nude mice following VSV injection 
The potential of this approach is that even oncolytic viruses that are extremely sensitive to type I IFN  such as attenuated SFV or M mutated VSV  may function well against oncovirus induced cancers where the oncovirus machinery ensures the lack of antiviral defense While on first thought it would appear counterintuitive to antagonize the very factors that keep oncolytic viruses tumor specific  emerging data shows that this can be accomplished in a safe way 
One of the foremost strategies to increase oncolytic virus efficacy is to combine them with drugs that lower tumor antiviral defenses 
In this regard  a primary target for interference is the prototypical type I IFN signaling cascade 
While small molecular inhibitors against IFNAR are not available  activity of downstream signaling transducers may effectively be blocked 
Human pancreatic cancer cells were shown to constitutively express high levels of MxA and OAS and to mount type I IFN dependent resistance to oncolytic VSV 
Resistance could be overcome by blocking activity of IFNAR associated Janus kinase  JAK      
Similarly  JAK  inhibitor ruxolitinib overcame type I IFN dependent resistance of human SCC  head and neck cancer cells against oncolytic VSV   
Ruxolitinib also successfully abrogated type I IFN mediated antiviral effects elicited by macrophages    highlighting that this drug might also alleviate type I IFN dependent tumor resistance to oncolytic viruses imposed by stromal cells 
However  the obvious downside to using JAK inhibitors is their effects on critical host defense mechanisms  which may result in increased infection of normal cells 
Moreover  JAK inhibitors may reduce anti tumor immune responses elicited by oncolytic virotherapy 
For example  ruxolitinib was shown to impair the capacity of dendritic cells promote CD  T cell responses against model tumor antigens   
On the other hand  in this study clearance of adenovirus was delayed in ruxolitinib treated normal animals  which makes it difficult to predict the overall impact of JAK inhibitors on tumor therapy where prolonged virus presence might translate to better therapeutic efficacy 
Also  while the immune stimulating and anti tumor effects of type I and type II interferons may be adversely affected by JAK inhibitors  central tumor promoting cascades mediated by JAKs  such as IL STAT  may also be inhibited    yielding a difficult to predict net therapeutic outcome 
At the moment  more studies are needed to establish the overall impact of interference with JAK  signaling in cancer therapy Spurred by earlier reports of oncovirus reactivation and promoter enhancement by histone deacetylase  HDAC  inhibitors  this class of agents was assessed for capacity to enhance oncolytic virus potency by inhibiting antiviral responses 
Indeed  such enhancement was observed with oncolytic VSV and SFV  and while it has been difficult to pinpoint the exact mechanisms that underlie HDAC inhibitor enhancement of oncolytic virus replication in cancer cells  antiviral defenses in general are inhibited for yet unknown reasons mainly in cancer cells and not in normal cells  which indirectly facilitates virus replication   
Interestingly  combination of HDAC inhibitors with conditionally replicating   E A deleted adenovirus gave improved virus replication rate and therapeutic efficacy in subcutaneous xenograft models only when the inhibitors were given before the virus  otherwise inhibition of replication was observed   
Similarly  HDAC inhibitors increased replication and oncolytic efficacy of HSV when given before the virus but not when given at the same time   
With nuclear DNA viruses  such as adenovirus and HSV  it is possible that HDAC inhibitors also alter virus genome accessibility to transcription factors  resulting in reduced replication or other adverse effects  implying that with these viruses HDAC inhibitors should be administered before the viruses Recently  it was found that HDAC inhibitor vorinostat activates NfκB signaling by facilitating hyperacetylation of the p  subunit  which in turn activates cellular autophagy   
Autophagy was in another study shown to be important for VSV replication  presumably by inhibiting antiviral signaling 
This is interesting  as a previous study revealed enhancement of VSV replication by inhibiting TNF alpha induced antiviral signaling mediated by p  using NfκB inhibitors BMS  or TPCA    
In this study  neither inhibitor had an effect on STAT  or STAT  phosphorylation or their nuclear relocalization in response to type I IFN but the authors observed clear induction of ISG  GBP  and MX  in response to type I IFN in U  glioma cells  with the latter two being dependent on NfκB signaling 
Taken together  NfκB pathway activation may result in different antiviral responses in different cancer types  and inhibition or enhancement of oncolytic viruses by NfκB inhibitors is dependent on other concomitant cellular mechanisms  such as autophagy Since HDAC inhibitors modulate promoter activity accessibility  it is conceivable other epigenetic or promoter modifying agents could work in a similar manner to repress antiviral defense induction and enhance oncolytic viruses   
DNA demethylating agents  azacytidine  Aza  and decitabine synergized with oncolytic herpes simplex type   virus in glioma models in vitro and in vivo  as did HDAC inhibitor valproic acid  VPA  which was already shown before to work well with oncolytic HSV as well as several other oncolytic viruses   
Moreover  inhibition of cancer antiviral defenses  specifically RNAseL and PKR  resulted when cancer cells were exposed to sunitinib  a multi tyrosine kinase inhibitor originally developed as an inhibitor of VEGF R and PDGF R signaling  yielding strong anti tumor synergy with IFN sensitive oncolytic VSV   
Since sunitinib is approved for renal cell carcinoma and imatinib resistant gastric cancers  combination with oncolytic VSV constitutes a promising and clinically relevant approach warranting further investigation 
Interstingly  sunitinib as well as several other receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors displayed antiviral effects against polyomavirus BK    arguing that these compounds are not universal virus enhancers Cyclophosphamide  CPA  is a general immunosuppressant used to minimize Treg presence during immunotherapy and also oncolytic virotherapy 
CPA may  however  also enhance replication and efficacy of oncolytic viruses by diminishing cytokine secretion by stromal cells  including type I IFN   
Another compound enhancing oncolytic virus efficacy by lowering cell responsiveness to type I IFN is triptolide  which acts downstream of IRF  activation   
Further  the kinase mammalian target of rapamycin  mTOR  enhances the antiviral effects of type I IFN by activation of its effector proteins  E BP  which binds and inactivates translation factor eIF E  and S K  which carries out cell type specific signaling functions of type I IFN  such as activation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor  B and promotion of ISG  transcription 
Consequently  rapamycin was able to enhance oncolytic VSV replication and anti tumor efficacy by inhibiting type I IFN mediated antiviral signaling via mTOR   Several other compounds synergizing with oncolytic viruses have been identified via high throughput drug library screening  many of which seem to act by antagonizing antiviral defenses 
For instance  a novel virus sensitizer  Vse  was found to greatly diminish antiviral effects of type I IFN against oncolytic VSV in several cancer cell types  and the drug also synergized with the virus in subcutaneous mouse tumor models   
For many of these new compounds  the mechanism of action is still poorly understood  necessitating extensive safety studies to exclude undesirable effects against normal cells Apart from classical type I IFN induced antiviral defenses  which typically prevent virus translation and degrade virus genomes  other cellular machineries regulate oncolytic virus efficacy 
Notably  strategies to increase cancer cell death in response to oncolytic viruses have been tested 
In a recent study  a class of compounds called SMAC mimetics synergized in several cancer models with oncolytic VSV by removing cancer cell block to apoptosis in response to virus induced type I IFN  TNF α or TRAIL   
Interestingly  since virus infection triggered cytokines act on nearby non infected cells  SMAC mimetics may in combination with oncolytic viruses also cause significant bystander tumor destruction 
Normal cells are not affected by the IFN SMAC mimetic synergy  providing an important safety aspect 
In another study  blocking the ER stress response circuitry triggered by oncolytic rhabdovirus infection by a small molecular inhibitor of serine threonine protein kinase and endoribonuclease IRE α  which was identified in a genome wide siRNA screen  greatly enhanced cytotoxicity via caspase induced apoptosis and increased oncolytic efficacy in refractory tumor models in mice   
This effect was independent on induction or responsiveness to type I IFN 
Conversely  inhibitors of nucleoside transporter   ENT  were discovered from a high throughput screen of enhancers of oncolytic HSV  and to date such inhibitors have not been reported to alter cellular antiviral responses   
Other compounds  such as common chemotherapeutics  and their mechanisms synergizing with oncolytic viruses have been discussed elsewhere for most of them the possible role of antiviral defense antagonism in enhancing oncolytic virus efficacy remains to be studied   Thus  many compounds are available to interfere with tumor antiviral defenses 
The outstanding question for most of them  however  seems to be why such compounds do not render normal cells sensitive to oncolytic viruses 
Elucidation of the exact mechanisms of action and the differences between normal and cancer cells constitute a worthy goal for studies in the near future Already in the  s it became clear that using certain pathogenic wildtype viruses  such as West Nile virus and Bunyamwera virus  in cancer patients would result in off target toxicity   
Characteristic for pathogenic viruses is a greater ability to circumvent or antagonize cellular innate antiviral defenses than attenuated strains 
For example  unlike the prototypical oncolytic reovirus strain type   Dearing  the T L strain of reovirus causes accumulation of IRF  in the nucleus and inhibits activation of a select group of ISGs yet because of this property the T L strain is myocarditic unlike the oncolytic type   Dearing strain   
For these reasons  many oncolytic viruses used today  such as reovirus type   Dearing  oncolytic strains of Newcastle disease virus and M mutated VSV have either a stronger capacity to induce or a weaker capacity to resist antiviral type I IFN than the corresponding wildtype strains   An open question  however  is whether strain specific or virus specific differences that relate to specific components of the cellular antiviral machinery may be exploited for greater anti tumor efficacy  i e  if one virus fails  could another be used in its stead 
While Ras expression was critical for oncolytic reovirus replication in cells overexpressing CUG  oncogene  oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus was unable to replicate in the same cells due to increased activation of STAT  and OASL    
Thus  in these cells reovirus was not affected by STAT  or OASL  and it therefore remains interesting to see which other antiviral effectors may have been lacking in the CUG expressing cells and  conversely  how reovirus and VSV differ in terms of sensitivity to antiviral effectors 
While several oncolytic viruses have been compared to each other in terms of replication rate and cytotoxicity  systematic studies with regard to tumor antiviral defenses have not been conducted As any attenuated virus is likely to replicate effectively only in its own niche  i e  to be restricted by a specific set of ISGs  and as wild type strains may be too toxic for use in humans  a compromise may be achieved by incorporating select elements from wild type viruses into oncolytic virus backbones 
Indeed  several chimeric and recombinant viruses have been generated that harbor specific elements of wild type strains or even of other unrelated viruses in order to better resist cancer antiviral defenses  Table  
As an example of introducing wild type elements into attenuated viruses  Haralambieva reported on a measles virus Edmonston vaccine strain in which P gene was replaced with the counterpart from the wild type IC B strain   
Later  Meng et al 
included N  P  and L genes from wild type measles in Edmonston backbone  producing an enhanced but still safe oncolytic virus   
Edmonston vaccine virus induces a more robust IFN response compared to wild type measles virus partly due to the weaker ability of V protein to suppress MDA mediated activation of IRF  and IFN I induction   
In vivo  P gene encoded proteins  particularly V  control the quality of the cytokine response to measles so that vaccine strains qualitatively induce a stronger inflammatory response compared to WT strains  where WT V protein suppresses multiple cytokine secretion 
V protein short cytoplasmic tail has been shown to bind and inactivate STAT  IRF  MDA  and the Rel homology domain of the NfκB subunit p  but not of p    
Also  V causes LGP  protein to bind and inactivate RIG I    but it seemingly does not interfere with TICAM   TRIF  multiple TLR adaptor  including TLR mediated IFN β induction 
Thus  if cancer and normal cells would differ with regard to TICAM  or IRF  then such a virus could potentially target specifically cancer cells rather than normal cells 
So far  the measles Edmonston WT chimeras have proven safe in animals As an example of heterologous virus constructs  lentogenic Newcastle disease virus engineered to express influenza virus PR   H N  NS  showed enhanced oncolytic efficacy in vivo due to dampening of antiviral responses   
While such a virus did not display enhanced pathogenicity in that study  a mesogenic NDV virus harboring NS  from influenza strain H N  did show increased pathogenicity in chickens as well as an increased ability to replicate in human cells    raising some cautionary warnings for future engineering of similar replicative viruses 
As another example  vaccinia virus soluble type I IFN scavenger B R  NOTE  B R is often used in the literature  has been engineered into both oncolytic HSV and oncolytic rhabdoviruses  resulting in all cases in more effective therapy agents without loss of tumor specificity   
Oncolytic γ  gene deleted HSV was complemented by two different PKR antagonists from human cytomegalovirus  TRS  and IRS  generating a chimera capable of reaching wild type virus replication levels in cancer cells in vitro and in tumor models in vivo   The selection of various viral IFN I antagonists that potentially could be used to augment attenuated oncolytic viruses is vast   
For example  increased replication of several viruses  including HIV  Sindbis virus and E deleted adenovirus in mammalian cells was observed when the cells were engineered to express vaccinia virus E L protein  influenza A virus NS  protein  ebola virus VP  protein or HIV  Tat protein   
The choice of antagonist must primarily be made with safety in mind  but virus specific and cell specific differences in antagonist functions may potentially be exploited rationally when considering the overall combination 
For example  vaccinia virus E L is able to rescue VSV but not EMCV from exogenous IFN  whereas vaccinia virus K L partially rescued EMCV but not VSV   In anticipation of systematic  perhaps bioinformatically guided   super chimera  studies  two or more viruses that may complement each other s shortcomings in antiviral defense antagonism have been considered 
Notably  vaccinia virus was favorably combined with IFN I sensitive oncolytic VSV and SFV  yielding tumor model dependent increases in overall therapy efficacy that were dependent on vaccinia virus antagonism of type I IFN responses  which increased the replication of the IFN sensitive viruses   
Such heterologous virotherapy approaches may also be used to generate immunological synergy  similar to heterologous prime boost vaccination  anti tumor immune responses may be increased due to targeting of the tumor by two different viruses  on two separate occasions  but anti virus immune responses would be generated against different viruses each time  avoiding the problem of neutralizing immunity to and predominance of antivirus immune responses   
Some other ideas explored experimentally include engineering oncolytic viruses to express other oncolytic viruses 
For example  the entire oncolytic parvovirus H  genome was placed under a regulatable promoter in oncolytic adenovirus  resulting in a more effective therapeutic entity than either virus alone without loss of tumor specificity   
The genetic material of Semliki Forest virus replicons has been engineered into adenovirus and vaccinia virus backbones   and several other virus chimeras have been constructed   
However  the effects on tumor antiviral defenses of such a constructs remain to be studied The attribute  oncolytic  implies for a virus that it infects and  indeed  lyses the infected tumor 
This property is primarily tested in vitro in cultured tumor cells 
We have learned  however  that in the native tumor microenvironment in living hosts many viruses are no longer able to infect tumor cells or to kill them even if they manage to infect them 
Tightly packed tumor cells and the network of supportive molecules of the extracellular matrix form a physical barrier to virus particle diffusion 
It has also become evident that the tumor cells themselves may be much more capable of thwarting oncolytic virus advances than previously thought  with some tumor cells residing in a seemingly permanent non permissive antiviral state 
Tumors harbor multiple cell types in addition to the neoplastic cells  which may promote and propagate both physical and cellular virus resistance 
As the efficacy of virotherapy in human cancer patients still falls shy of the achievements in animal models  it appears quite plausible that one or more of the barriers described in this review indeed constitute a real and formidable obstacle for oncolytic virus advancement into routine clinical use 
Fortunately  some of the most difficult barriers have been identified  and a rapidly expanding arsenal of countermeasures is at our disposal 
Our task is now to separate the wheat from the chaff and to systematically evaluate the proposed combination regimens that will yield the best results without compromising patient safety Evidence of prenatal toxicity of herbal based indigenous formulations for sex selection in rat modelsTraditional or indigenous preparations  IPs  are getting considerable attention in global health debates  It continues to be used widely in several countries and its consumption is rapidly increasing 
 
  Many reports have documented the use of such preparations 
For instance  in China  traditional herbal medicines played a critical role during the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome  SARS  In fact  many drugs in modern medicine had their roots in the traditional system of medicine 
Drugs like Penicillin  from Penicillium fungi  and Digoxin  from Digitalis purpurea  are some such examples 
One of the promising therapies for Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus  MRSA  infection is a ninth century treatment for eye infections which is a recipe consisting of garlic and onions  wine  and bile from a cow s stomach brewed in a brass cauldron 
It is however important to note that culture specific practices are not always safe 
Digitalis is a classic example where herbalists use this plant in allopathic treatment strategies  while in some countries such as Britain  law restricts their vast availability  A report from Australia describes the adverse effects of ‘herbal  preparations or IPs  Problems arise when people do not report about the consumption of such preparations assuming that these are devoid of any side effects by virtue of them being natural products  The need for research in this field is huge and scientific research into the quality  safety  molecular effects and clinical efficacy is crucial 
 
 
Pregnancy is considered a time of minimal intervention  and a period when herbal medicines are usually contraindicated  It is reported that many women consume indigenous medicines  that contains Bryonia laciniosa  Quercus infectoria and Putranjiva roxburghii along with other ingredients  during early pregnancy to beget a male child in India 
These preparations  often called sex selection drugs  SSD  contain herbal ingredients but these are off the label prescriptions and hence cannot be certified as ‘herbal  medicines 
The prevalence of consumption varies from   to as high as         Studies have indicated that there is  –  times higher risk of birth defects including major malformations of internal organs like urogenital and renal malformation  trachea esophageal fistula  and visible defects like spina bifida  cleft lip palate and imperforate anus 
 
  Risk of stillbirths also increases   folds 
Studies suggest that a single exposure during pregnancy can be deleterious 
 
 
 
  SSDs are reported to contain phytoestrogens  steroids and heavy metals 
 
 
 
  It is also known that although placenta serves as a barrier  most drugs and environmental chemicals enter the foetal circulation by passive diffusion or active transport  However  despite growing evidence on deleterious effects of these herbal formulations  few studies have attempted to systematically understand the risk of such preparations using animal models 
Genetic sex of a child is determined at the time of conception by the fertilization of the ovum with X or Y sperms and intake of so called preparations for sex selection can never alter that In view of these  the current study was conducted with an objective to determine the embryo foetal and development toxicity of SSDs following maternal exposure during critical period of organogenesis using a small animal model The study was guided by the OECD guidelines for testing of chemicals  Guideline no    adopted on  nd January   Prenatal Developmental Toxicity Study  and was based on a mutually approved protocol

The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee  Venus Medicine Research Center 
Due permission was taken from the Ethics Committee of Indian Institute of Public Health Delhi For this experiment  strain of Sprague Dawley of rats  Rattus norvegicus  was used 
The number of dams per group was   instead of   as laid down under OECD guidelines 
Rats of both sexes  –  g  were obtained from National Institute of Biologicals  India at  –  weeks of age  acclimatized for five days and then subjected to the experiment at  –  weeks of age 
They were housed in standard polypropylene rat cages with stainless steel top grill  one dam per cage  at a temperature of       °C  with  –  relative humidity 
Bedding material and cages were changed once in six days and   hourly light dark cycle was followed 
Animals were identified by their existing ear numbering 
Cages were labelled by tags indicating the study number  sex  group of the animals  experimental start and completion dates 
Standard pelleted feed  from Ashirwad Industries  Mohali  India  was provided ad libitum to all the animals 
They also had free access to purified water via drinking bottles throughout the study 
The feed  cages and drinking bottles were not analysed for the presence of phytoestrogens and bisphenol A 
However  similar materials were used for all the rats across all groups The drug comprised of IPs for sex selection  SSD 
These non branded locally made preparations are made available  –  days after placing an order and are never sold openly 
These preparations essentially contain herbal ingredients such as Shivlingi  Bryonia laciniosa  Majuphal  Quercus infectoria  Putrajeevak  Putranjiva roxburghii  Nagkesar  Mesua ferrea  and feather of peacock  Pavo cristatus 
A total of   such samples of SSDs were procured from varied sources like ‘pansari  shop owners  grocers  local alternative medicine practitioners  rickshaw pullers  drivers and commoners from different states 
SSDs are advised to be consumed between   and   weeks of pregnancy The samples were categorized into   groups based on redundancy of the preparations and common ingredients reported 
This was followed by chemical analysis in an accredited laboratory to detect the presence of phytoestrogens and steroids 
Since we explored the toxic effects of these preparations we wanted to select two samples that would be most predictive of toxicity 
Due to resource constraints  we did not want to subject all the   samples for animal study 
Hence  three samples of SSDs  found to be most rich in phenols and steroids were selected for toxicity study  All the three samples were also tested for heavy metals which suggested that Lead and Mercury were in very high quantities  The toxicity was examined using C  elegans  an alternate animal model 
Survival analysis and reproductive toxicity was assessed from the brood size and progeny count assay  The two SSDs that were found to be most toxic were selected as test items for the subsequent study in rat models 
SSD   was reported to contain Shivlingi and Putrajeevak while SSD   contained Shivlingi  Majuphal  Putrajeevak  Nagkesar and feathers of peacock 
Both the samples were obtained from grocers 
Local preparations like these are bound to have certain degree of variability in concentrations but more often than not  these remain the major ingredients According to studies reported  women consume such preparations along with cow s milk in dosages and schedule that are quite varied 
While some advise these IPs to be consumed for one day  others prescribe it for   days  to be taken thrice a day 
We considered the amount of SSDs most commonly reported by pregnant women  weighing   kg  which was  –  g daily for   days 
The dose of the test item   mg kg  was calculated by using conversion factor of  Conversion factor is the ratio of the correction factors  estimated by dividing the average body weight in kgs of species by the body surface area in m  of the species  Km

On the day of dosing  the doses were administered between  –  h  The test items were administered in fresh cow s milk at a final volume of   ml kg 
The doses were calculated on the basis of the latest body weight recorded for the study 
A stainless steel gavage cannula fitted to a calibrated syringe was used for dosing the animals For control animals  cow s milk was used as a vehicle while feeding The study was performed in two phases to evaluate the effect of SSD consumption duration during gestation period Adult  nulliparous female rats were mated with males of same species and strain in  
Each morning  dams were examined for the presence of a vaginal plug and vaginal smear was taken from each dam by using pipette smear technique 
The day of vaginal plug formation or sperms observed in vaginal smear  also known as successful mating  were considered as GD   Gestation day  
The mated females were housed individually in clear polycarbonate cages with stainless steel wire lids 
Mating process was carried out to result in   pregnant animals per group 
Successfully mated females were randomized into control and treatment groups 
All the rats were sacrificed on GD  
According to OECD guidelines  the test chemical should be administered daily from implantation to the day prior to scheduled caesarean section in order to assess toxicity 
Test chemicals were administered to pregnant animals and sacrificed as per the schedule  which was as close as possible to the normal day of delivery without risking loss of data resulting from early delivery i e GD  
The females were killed  before caesarean section  the uterine contents were examined  and the fetuses were evaluated for soft tissue and skeletal changes The pregnant rats were randomized to two intervention and one control groups

Each group of rats was treated with either vehicle or SSD  or SSD 
Allocation of animals was randomized to the following groups  G   Control  VC  G   SSD    mg kg  G   SSD    mg kg  G   SSD    mg kg  G   SSD    mg kg  G SSD    mg kg  G   SSD    mg kg The following parameters were observed •Clinical Signs  Animals were observed once after successful mating or on GD  and after administration of the first dose 
Cage side observations for clinical signs of toxicity in the animals were recorded once daily until the day before necropsy •Body weight  Body weight of all experimental animals were recorded once before mating  initial body weight  and then after confirmation of mating 
Body weights were recorded on days               and on terminal day before sacrifice 
These recorded body weights were used for calculating the dose volume to be administered •Food consumption  Food consumption was evaluated once after successful mating or on day   of gestation  the day of vaginal plug formation or sperms observed in vaginal smear  and on days             and one day prior to sacrifice 
Calculated amount of feed were placed in the trough of each cage and the quantity of feed remaining after approximately   h were weighed and recorded •Morbidity Mortality  All the animals were observed twice daily  once in the morning between   and   h and once in the evening between   and   h  for incidence of morbidity and or mortality •Maternal examination related parameters  At the end of the observation period  all the dams were sequentially euthanized  by CO  asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation  and subjected to gross necropsy 
After termination  dams were examined macroscopically for any structural abnormalities or pathological changes 
Blinding was done while evaluation of the dams during caesarean section and subsequent foetal analyses to minimize bias 
Pregnancy rate was calculated as the proportion of mated pairs that had produced at least one pregnancy within a fixed period where pregnancy was determined by the earliest available evidence that fertilization has occurred 
Gestation index was calculated to indicate number of females with live born as a proportion of number of females with evidence of pregnancy •Examination of uterine contents  Immediately after termination  the uteri were removed and the pregnancy status of the animals ascertained 
Gravid uteri including the cervix were weighed  and number of corpora lutea were determined 
The uterine contents were examined for numbers of embryonic or foetal deaths and live foetuses 
The degree of resorption was described in order to estimate the relative time of death of the conceptus 
Any increase in the number of resorption and or implantation loss is an indicator of litter size for the individual dam •Examination of foetuses  The sex and weight of each foetus were determined 
Approximately one half of each litter were prepared and examined for skeletal alterations from selected dams 
The remainder were prepared and examined for soft tissue alterations  using accepted or appropriate serial sectioning methods or careful gross dissection techniques 
Each foetus was examined for external alterations 
Foetuses were examined for skeletal alterations  using Alizarin Red S staining method 
The fetuses for skeletal staining were kept in pre labelled plastic containers containing   ethanol before staining 
After skinning  we processed the foetus for staining by immersing in   alcian blue   GX for three days  then performed rehydration through a gradient series of ethanol   ethanol   –  h twice    ethanol   –  h  ethanol   –  h  distilled water until the samples sank to the bottom of a conical tube 
Samples were further treated with   KOH for  –  days or until it became clear and again treated with   alizarin red for next  –  days until bones became purple 
Samples were rinsed   times in   KOH  for  –  h at each time point 
Samples were further treated with a gradient series of glycerol  KOH    h   glycerol   h X  Visceral examination was done by micro dissection technique 
Fetuses were preserved in   formalin until they became fixed 
An illuminated magnifier was used for visceral examination 
We placed the foetus in a supine position on a paraffin wax block tray covered with paraffin wax  secured the fetal limbs by paper pins to the paraffin wax block  made a ventral midline incision from the umbilicus  cutting caudally to the genital tubercle and cranially to the diaphragm 
Once incision was completed  we located the ventral attachment of the diaphragm and lifted the liver carefully to examine the diaphragm for abnormal opening 
After observation  the diaphragm was clipped 
We gave a longitudinal cut to open the rib cage slightly lateral to and on the right of the sternebrae and then extended the cut anteriorly to neck region 
The rib cage was opened gently and secured to the paraffin block petridish tray with pins Foetuses were examined for soft tissue alterations  e g 
variations and malformations or anomalies  using Wilson s Technique 
The fetal viscera were examined sequentially  beginning with thoracic organs and moving caudally 
We performed hearts cuts after completion of other observations 
We examined the bilobed thymus for size  shape  coloration and presence of haemorrhages and then removed it for observation of trachea and esophagus 
We observed the lungs for size  color and number of lobes  observed the trachea  esophagus for normal alignment and presence of fistula  opened the pericardial sac and cut off pericardium to expose the heart for observation 
We checked the size  shape  color of the heart and normal development of major blood vessels 
After observation of thoracic viscera  we observed the abdominal viscera and liver for size  shape  color  texture  and number of lobes 
External anatomy of heart was examined by making two incisions using micro dissecting scissors We examined the stomach  spleen  pancreas  small and large intestines for size  position or any other developmental anomalies 
The intestines were moved aside after observation for seeing the underlying structures 
Ureters were checked for normal size and location and for continuity from the renal hilus to the urinary bladder 
One kidney was cut transversely and another was longitudinally to examine renal papilla and renal pelvis 
To confirm the sex of the foetus  the gonads were inspected carefully 
We examined the reproductive organs for size  shape and location GraphPad Prism® statistical software version   was used to analyze the data and all the results were represented as mean   S E M 
Intergroup variance for most of the parameters was calculated by one way analysis of variance  ANOVA  followed by Tukey s test 
A value of p     was regarded statistically significant 
Linear regression was performed to examine the weight change of dams during pregnancy for each group comparing with the control after adjusting for the litter size 
The malformations were analysed by performing Chi square test for trend for two groups  SSD  G  G  G  G  and SSD  G  G  G  G The ARRIVE guidelines were followed to report the findings 
In phase   pre natal study  all the dams dosed with SSD  and SSD  had normal food intake and weight gain 
The average gain in weight from GD  to GD   was       gms for controls while it was       gms in SSD   and       gms in SSD 
 Webtable  
No test item related mortality or clinical sign of toxicity was encountered during the study 
All dams in treatment groups and control group survived to scheduled terminal sacrifice 
They showed normal behaviour until euthanized 
There were no differences in mean maternal body weights  body weight gains  pregnancy rate  gestational index  pre and post implantation loss  and resorptions 
No significant differences were observed in foetal sex ratio  foetal body weights 
However  one dam from SSD  had all male foetuses 
No abnormality was detected in skeletal and visceral examination In phase   controls and SSD  and SSD  treated dams exhibited a comparable food intake  Table  
 
However  a dose response relationship was observed with reduced weight gain with higher doses of SSDs 
 Table  
 
Two dams  one in G   SSD    mg kg  and the other in G   SSD    mg kg  categories showed decreased or consistent body weight GD  onwards 
On an average  the weight on GD   was       gms in controls while it was       with SSD    mg kg  and       gms with SSD    mg kg 
The adjusted analysis indicated that except in G  there was a significant reduction in weight gain in all the intervention groups as compared to the control group after controlling for litter size  Table  
 During follow up  one dam from SSD    mg kg  and one from SSD    mg kg  showed haematuria during gestational day  – 
However  no another clinical sign of toxicity was encountered during the study 
All the dams in treatment and control groups showed normal behaviour and survived to scheduled terminal sacrifice 
In phase   pregnancy rate and gestational index were found to be   at all dose levels with SSD  whereas  in SSD  it decreased to   in G   SSD    mg kg  and G   SSD    mg kg  groups 
One dam from G   SSD    mg kg  and another one from G   SSD    mg kg  group showed mating confirmation during vaginal smear examination and showed positive sign in initial days of pregnancy but during necropsy on expected day of delivery  GD   no foetus was found 
Body weights of dams increased in the initial stages that became constant at a later period 
To reconfirm it  non gravid uterus was stained in salewski strain and presence of conceptus was found 
This indicated the possibility of miscarriage Increased pre and post implantation losses as well as resorptions and reduced live foetuses were observed with both SSD  and SSD 
No significant differences were observed in foetal sex ratio  but decreased foetal body weights were noted in both sexes 
On an average one early resorption in a group was a normal observation 
More than one late resorption was observed in all treatment groups while there was none in the control group 
Total count of live foetuses count was significantly reduced with SSD  and SSD  treatment in a dose dependent manner 
Total number of live foetuses were reduced up to   in SSD  at   mg kg treatment group and   in SSD  at   mg kg treatment group Both SSD  and SSD s at different dose levels showed decreased fetal weight in dose dependent manner  although the difference was not significant 
Skeletal and soft tissue alterations were observed in both treatment groups 
In general  the embryo–foetal examination showed abnormalities  which could have caused some functional damage to these foetuses if allowed to grow in the normal course 
In visceral examinations  slight dilation of the renal pelvis  reduced papilla size  urinary bladder hypertrophy was observed in few foetuses from both SSD  and SSD  treatment groups 
Few incidences of foetal soft tissue abnormalities encountered in this study were normal variants 
Skeletal examination showed variations in the ossification patterns like incomplete or poorly ossified skulls  ossification of sternebra  cleavage ossification of thoracic centrum  asymmetric thoracic centrum  and supernumerary rib in many foetuses in SSD  and SSD  groups  Table  
 
A trend was noted with increased incidence of certain malformations with increasing dosages of SSDs that was statistically significant for most malformations with SSD The results of this developmental toxicity study suggest that administration of SSDs to pregnant rats had significant impact on intrauterine foetal growth  early and late resorption as well as developmental anomalies 
These formulations have teratogenic potential but does not affect sex ratio IPs contain phytoestrogens like diadzein and genistein  In vitro rat whole embryo culture assay  WEC  studies of genistein in rats have indicated fetotoxic and teratogenic potential at concentration of ≥  μg mL  However  in vivo  an oral  gavage  embryonic and fetal development pilot study could not demonstrate any teratogenic effect in the same study 
These findings are different from our study probably because we used SSDs containing natural herbal and non herbal ingredients unlike those studies where synthetic genistein was used 
In both the studies  decreased body weight was observed indicating slight maternal toxicity 
Food consumption was unaffected in our study which is contrary to what was reported 
In another study  pregnant rats exposed to oral isoflavones  diadzein and genistein in varying combinations  showed alterations in the number of live foetuses  lysed foetuses  number of resorption sites  and implantation sites while no clinical signs suggestive of maternal toxicity  seizures  tremors and salivation  that was observed similar to our study 
Maternal mass gain was significantly reduced in rats treated with   mg kg of isoflavones  Ratio of females to males in the litter of different groups was similar akin to our finding  These observations clearly nullify the claim that consumption of SDDs could alter the sex of the growing foetus 
An analysis done by the same authors earlier revealed that SSDs contain testosterone and steroids 
 
  The prenatal testosterone in pregnancy is known to affect sexual development adversely      The principles of reproductive biology state that the genetic sex of an individual is determined at the time of conception and can never be altered under any circumstances 
However  phenotypic sex of the growing foetus is likely to be influenced by the hormonal milieu of in utero environment 
Our analysis was confined to phenotypic sex only and hence it is difficult to state if any differences existed with reference to genetic and phenotypic sex 
This requires further inquiry Evidence on the effects of SSDs on humans should best be obtained from human beings 
The findings of the current study corroborate well with the evidence generated from observational studies in human beings      Presence of skeletal and visceral malformations could explain why stillbirths are likely to be more in women who consume SSDs 
The dosing of the test drugs was intended not only to examine the period of organogenesis solely but to assess effects from preimplantation  through the entire period of gestation to the day before caesarean section 
The results were based on observations of more than   female animals with implantation sites at necropsy that added to its strength 
Unnecessary handling of pregnant animals as well as any stressors from outside was avoided 
At least three dose levels and a concurrent vehicle control were used with dams randomly allocated to different treatment groups that support the validity of the results 
However  absence of   rats per group does not support it to be a fully OECD compliant study 
We did follow the principles of Good Laboratory Practices  GLP  but due to constraints of resources the study could not be conducted as a GLP compliant study  though this is optimal for academic interests There is a lack of systematic approach to assess the safety and effectiveness of herbal preparations 
Ingredients for herbal medicines are often drawn from different sources and are used in combination  which may exhibit variability in terms of species  growing conditions  and biologically active constituents 
To isolate each active ingredient from each herb and then to establish its toxicity is time consuming  resource intensive and not practical 
Moreover  drug approval process does not accommodate undifferentiated mixtures  Though important  it surpasses the herb herb interaction and the potentiating effect of one compound over another 
Therefore  in our study  we administered the herbal mixture to assess the effects 
Real time evaluations have yielded important observations for several herbal drugs especially related to pregnancy 
For instance  Wang et al 
  used mice model to evaluate the adverse pregnancy outcomes after maternal exposure to the herbal medicines  particularly during early pregnancy  The major events included maternal and perinatal mortality 
Maternal weight gain  embryo growth and post natal weight gain were significantly decreased 
Moreover  foetal resorption and skeletal malformations were increased  signifying potential toxicity of Chinese herbal medicines 
This is comparable to our findings To conclude  the results of this developmental toxicity study suggest that administration of SSD  and SSD  to pregnant rats exerted significant impact on intrauterine foetal growth and development without any effect on sex ratio when administered during the period of organogenesis

It is therefore natural to expect that the distribution of amino acids  across all protein sequences  would appear to be fixed  given no mutations over a specific period of time 
Of the   naturally occurring amino acids  each seems to appear randomly located at a particular position within the sequence of a protein 
However  when the sequences of a group of proteins are compared to one another  specific patterns begin to emerge 
These patterns are commonly referred to as motifs and frequently produce similar structural elements and in many cases  similar functions between the proteins that contain them 
In recent years  significant efforts have been made to reduce sequences into discrete motifs  so that each can be linked to some specific biological function based on particular rules      
Databases that consist of identifiable amino acid motifs  such as PROSITE  Pratt and EMOTIF  have been constructed to allow researchers an easy classification of unknown proteins into families based on their common motifs               
All of these methods share one property  they depend on specific alignment algorithms  such as the basic local alignment search tool  BLAST or PSI BLAST  to perform the sequence comparison between diverse families of proteins being analyzed      
These methods have already led to a number of key discoveries and offer the promise of determining biologically meaningful information about function from a protein s primary sequence It is generally accepted that a strong correlation exists between a protein s amino acid sequence and its resulting structure and function         
Techniques that can quickly determine significant similarities between protein sequences are valuable in predicting an unknown protein s function within the cell 
Here we describe a procedure that  by computing the frequency of key amino acid pairs  can quickly classify large groups of proteins into functional groups 
In order to uncover any relevant amino acid strings  we have utilized statistical methods applicable to datasets with large fluctuations in the search of human protein sequences within both the Swiss Prot and Complete Human Genebank databases The goal of this manuscript is to demonstrate how these two residue motifs can be used to develop rapid methods for searching protein or genomic databases in order to locate potentially interesting or aberrant protein sequences 
As an example  we describe the distribution of select amino acid pairs within the genome of the Coronavirus  Tor  which is responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome  SARS    
We have examined additional sets  but the limited format of this paper precludes a large presentation of potential applications The set of all   naturally occurring  amino acids are described by their standard single letter representations  and are taken as the complete set contained within all protein sequences as shown below Zq A R N D C Q E G H I L K M F P S T W Y V Residues that are arranged in a certain order can be referred to as vectors and are represented symbolically as b n b b bn bj Zq The coordinates of each vector represent the amino acid symbols contained within any given protein  where n is the total length of the vector 
The collection of all vectors b n  in the proteome can therefore be denoted simply by Zq n The underlying structure of a protein sequence  which is the order of the amino acids  has unique and identifiable characteristics 
As an analogy  in written English  the letter q is almost always followed by u 
Also  the frequency of the word  and  is much higher than that of the related three letter strings   nad   nda   dan  and  dna  which are simply permutations of the same set of individual letters to construct a word with a different meaning 
Utilizing similar characteristics  we can intuitively scan for unique sequence vectors contained within any given protein 
We expand on these characteristics  by utilizing the concepts of affinity and order stability in Section  Using the entire Swiss Prot database  release number   as the basis for our calculations  we have constructed a probability table for the occurrence of the   naturally occurring amino acids  see Table  
    
In addition to the Swiss Prot database  we have also included data from Complete Human Genebank  NCBI Build Number   March    as a source for all characterized and hypothetical human protein sequences We use the symbol Ω to denote the Swiss Prot database  and the letter M to denote the number of proteins in the database  
Hence we can state that Ω As s M  where As a a as Ns  is the sth protein  ai with i Zq is the ith amino acid in the sequence  and Ns is the length of the protein sequence As 
For any vector b n  if there is a sequence As in Ω such that b n  is a segment of As  then we can say b n  occurs in Ω 
We can then use NΩ b n  to denote the total number of outcomes that b n  has occurred in Ω  and let NΩ n  be the total number of all vectors occurring in Ω with length n  Therefore p b n NΩ b n NΩ n is the probability that the vector b n  occurs in Ω 
We then introduce k p q b n log p b n q b n where p b n  and q b n  are any two probability distributions on Zq n  and b n  belongs to Zq n 
The quantity k p q b n  in Eq 
  is defined for any two probability distributions p b n  and q b n  on Zq n  where the distribution q arises from independent letter  i e  amino acid  probabilities 
Then  k p q b n  can be viewed as a random variable about b n  and its probability distribution is defined as follows F p q x PI k p q b n ⩽x b n k p q b n ⩽xp b n The expectation value μ p q  and variance σ p q  of p b n  are expressed mathematically as μ p q b n Zq n p b n k p q b n 
 σ p q b n Zq n p b n k p q b n μ p q  Hence we see that μ p q  is simply the Kullback–Leibler entropy   
As a consequence  μ p q  is always non negative and μ p q  if and only if p b n q b n 
As a result  the amino acid sequence of b n  can be represented by k p q b n In Eq 
  the probability distributions p  q in the k p q b n  have several possible values 
For example  if we let p be the probability of b n  and only change the value of q in k p q b n  we obtain the following expression q b n j np bj p b p b p bn Based on Eqs 
  and   the value of k p q b n  gives us the affinity for all amino acids within vector b n 
Here two situations are identified as especially interesting i When k p q b n  implies that among the amino acids in vector b n  there is an increased affinity 
That is  the vector b n  occurs more frequently than expected 
 ii When k p q b n  implies that among the amino acids in vector b n  there is a decreased affinity 
That is  the vector b n  occurs less frequently than expected In a similar approach to the condition described above  we may choose q b n p πn b n  where πn b n  is a permutation of b n  and πn denotes a permutation transform 
In this case  the order sensitivity of b n  can also be reflected by the value of k p q b n  and produces the following outcomes i when k p q b n  implies that b n  occurs much more often than πn b n ii when k p q b n  implies that πn b n  occurs much more often than b n In addition to the concepts of affinity and order sensitivity  we can also design other analysis techniques by choosing alternate representations of q b n 
Quantifying the terms k p q b n  we can represent vector frequency numerically 
In cases where k p q b n μ p q ⩾ σ p q  the corresponding vector b n  is called  positive  while in those cases where the opposite takes place  k p q b n μ p q ⩽ σ p q  the vector b n  is called  negative 
By judiciously choosing a   equal to   we obtained   two residue  positive pairs  and   two residue negative pairs  see Table  
  out of a total of   possibilities of amino acid pairs Using any one of the positive motifs from Table   we can develop a test method to detect changes in their distribution through any protein database 
If b b b  is  positive  then p b b μ σp b p b  where p ⋅  is the probability of the amino acids or vectors ⋅ in the database 
Since NΩ μ M Nμ p bj NΩ bj μ MNμ we have NΩ b μ M Nμ μ MNμ μ σp b NΩ b or NΩ b μ M Nμ μ MNμ μ σp b NΩ b and since μ M Nμ is very close to μ MNμfor Swiss Prot database we have NΩ b μ σp b NΩ b and NΩ b μ σp b NΩ b As a consequence of Eq 
  the detection of a deleterious mutation based on the increased appearance of an arbitrary string of these residues becomes possible 
For example  according to Table   CC is an attractive motif with   then NΩ CC μ σp C μ M Nμ μ MNμNΩ C ≈ μ σp C NΩ C Let Ns CC  and Ns C  be the number of CC and the number of C in the sth protein 
Then we have NΩ CC NΩ C  because μ σ  and p C  since NΩ CC s MNs CC NΩ C s MNs C Based upon the result that the CC pair represents a rare event  proteins satisfying Ns CC Ns C  as defined in Eq 
  suddenly become interesting 
We can therefore consider the number Ns CC  as an index to develop detection methods to test for the presence of a CC containing protein within a database 
Using this same reasoning  one can also use any other one of the remaining motifs in Table   to develop detection methods for additional proteins In an identical fashion to the previous example using the positive two residue motifs in Table   we can also use any of the  negative  two residue motifs to develop search methods 
For example  the CM pair is a  negative  two residue  word  with  
That is  p CM μ σp C p M 
Using identical arguments to those described in Section   we obtain NΩ CM NΩ M  and NΩ CM NΩ C 
Since both Ns M  and Ns C  are small numbers for fixed proteins  the overall number of CM pairs in most proteins should be close to zero 
Therefore  we can also use any of the remaining seven  negative  motifs in Table   to develop additional detection methods In contrast to the CC motif  the total number of proteins in the Swiss Prot database having more than one CM pair is quite small 
For example  among the   proteins contained within this database  the number of proteins such that Ns CM ⩾  is   and the number of proteins satisfying the condition Ns CM ⩾  is only  
For human proteins in Swiss Prot  the total number of proteins containing CM pairs is   and there are only   proteins that satisfy Ns CM ⩾   Table  
However  we would expect to find about   proteins having CM pairs in the Swiss Prot database  based upon the amino acid frequencies given in Table   which is greater than the number observed Cysteine rich proteins and the presence of CC pairs in proteins are both concepts that have been studied previously      
If we combine these two concepts and describe them in mathematical terms  we observe that the rates q Ns C Ns and q Ns CC Ns C  describe these two conditions  where Ns  Ns C  and Ns CC  are the numbers of all amino acids  cysteine  and CC  respectively 
We can then derive proteinsNs C Ns p C σ Ns CC Ns C p ξτ C ξτ C σ where σ  and σ  are the standard deviations about Ns C Nss Mand Ns CC Ns C s M respectively We have found the following computational results based on Swiss Prot database σ ≈ σ ≈ andp ξτ C ξτ C ⩾ p C For   we have a much simpler method to determine that a protein sequence is both C  and CC rich if proteinsNs C Ns ∩proteinsNs CC Ns C So  a much simpler method to test whether a protein is a both C  and CC rich for   isNumber of CC  Number of C Number of C  Length of protein Using this principle  we found a total of eight proteins that are both C  and CC rich within the Swiss Prot database For   there is an easier method to determine whether a protein sequence is both C  and CC rich if proteinsNs C Ns ∩proteinsNs CC Ns C So  a much simpler method to test whether a protein is both C  and CC rich for   is based on the inequalitiesNumber of CC  Number of C Number of C  Length of protein Using this principle  we can get a total of   proteins that are both C  and CC rich within the entire Swiss Prot database For   there is also an easier method to determine if a protein sequence is both C  and CC rich sequence when proteinsNs C Ns ∩proteinsNs CC Ns C So  a much simpler method to test whether a protein is both C  and CC rich for   is based on the inequalitiesNumber of CC  Number of C Number of C Length of protein Using this principle  we have identified a total of   proteins that are both C  and CC rich within the Swiss Prot database 
From these results  it becomes clear that there are many C rich proteins and many CC rich proteins that are not mutually inclusive 
The sets of both C  and CC rich proteins are only subsets of the set containing all C rich proteins or that containing all CC rich proteins Because the Swiss Prot database is somewhat biased to those proteins that are of interest to researchers  we have decided to examine a database that was  in essence  complete 
For this  we chose the human subset sequences contained within the Complete Human Genebank database 
This was the most complete and readily available source of human genetic sequences and should therefore provide us with an accurate representation of both CC and CM pair distributions 
We observed that the total number of CC pairs within the human subset of sequences contained in Genebank  a total of   proteins  was  
These pairs were contained within a total of   proteins  Table   a number that is substantially larger than the   we obtained from Swiss Prot data  Table  
Since the total number of amino acids in The Complete Human Genebank is   we can easily get the expected number of CC in Complete Human Genebank is   which is much less than this actual value  
The same also holds true for the CM pair  where we would expect to see   CM pairs  but actually observe    Table  
 
This result is surprising but true and shows that there are fundamental difference between the Human and other species in terms of the frequency of CC and CM pairs To create a single CM pair  it is obvious that one needs only a single C  If a protein sequence also contains a CC pair  the total number of cysteines available to create a CM pair has been reduced by a factor of  
Using the cutoff value of four CC pairs as statistically significant  we determined the probability of finding a CM pair within proteins that already contained a CC pair  Table  
Even though both CC and CM can occur in the same protein  the total number of proteins in Genebank that contain both CC and CM pairs is   and these pairs almost always occur at different locations in the sequence 
However  in some rare cases the second C within the CC pair is shared with the first C within the CM pair  giving us a new triplet CCM If we filter the set of proteins described above for redundant entries  we obtain a set of   unique proteins that contain the CCM triplet in the human proteome 
Using the probability distributions obtained from Swiss Prot  we obtained the probability of CCM as  
Since the total of all protein lengths in the Swiss Prot database is   there should be a total of   CCM triplets 
This value is almost identical to the predicted number of CCM of  
This result suggests that the CCM triplet at least in Swiss Prot occurs randomly 
However  we can also analyze the CCM probability using a different approach  putting q CCM p CC p M  into Eq 
 
If CCM occurs randomly  then we have p CCM p C p C p M  and since p CC μ σp C p C  we will get k p q CCM log p CCM q CCM log p C p CC ⩽ μ σ Based on Eq 
  it is clear that the presence of a CC pair strongly excludes M  Therefore  the probability of the CCM triplet should occur less frequently than that of CC or M individually We have obtained the following statistical results with regard to the total number of CC and CM pairs contained in the Swiss Prot database i The total number of these proteins satisfying Ns CC ⩾  is   and   of these are found in humans 
 ii The total number of human proteins in Ω that satisfy Ns CC ⩾  is  
 iii The total number of the proteins in Ω that satisfy Ns CM ⩾  is     of these are found in humans 
 iv The total number of human proteins in Ω that satisfy Ns CM ⩾  is only  
The genome of the SARS associated Coronavirus contains a total of   open reading frames  which code for six characterized and five uncharacterized proteins   
After examining the complete proteome the SARS associated Coronavirus we observed a statistically significant increase in the occurrence of the CC and CM pairs in the SARS associated Coronavirus  genome Of the   putative proteins  four contain either CC or CM pairs 
Two large poly proteins  GI  and GI  contain   CC and   CM pairs  as well as   CC and   CM pairs  respectively 
The putative spike glycoprotein  GI    contains   CC and   CM  while the small envelope protein  GI    contains only   CC pair 
The remaining   proteins  of which two have been identified as a nucleocapsid and matrix protein  contain no CC or CM pairs 
When compared to the occurrence of CC and CM pairs within all human proteins found in the Swiss Prot database  it becomes clear that there is an increased occurrence of these pairs within the SARS associated Coronavirus proteome It is clear that the frequency of CC and CM pairs is significantly higher in the SARS genome than it is in the human genome 
It is our hope that these unique two residue motifs could be used as a means of identifying a virus such as SARS 
While currently impossible to determine  one can see a possible clinical use for determining the frequency of CC or CM pairs in an individual 
If a person has been infected by SARS  we would expect the numbers of CC and CM pairs to be much higher than in a healthy individual 
If we were then able to develop a clinically feasible technique that could identify the CC or CM pair content in total cellular protein  without damaging the cell  it could be possible to implement a detection method simply by counting the numbers of CC or CM pairs in all proteins examined 
If the presence of increased CC or CM pairs was indicative of infection by SARS we could develop new drugs to inhibit the translation of proteins that contain these pairs within infected cells 
As a very specific example  this could be accomplished through the use of specific tRNA mimics that could block translating ribosome when these pairs appear at the P and A site simultaneously      
While tRNA mimics could normally be seen as non specific protein synthesis inhibitors  the lower frequency of the CC or CM motifs in host proteins as compared to the relatively high occurrence in viral protein provide a starting point for the analysis of treatments using methods such as these In this paper we have performed a detailed search of the Swiss Prot and Complete Human Genebank database in relation to the frequencies of each of the   natural amino acids and motifs made up of two residues 
This has provided us with a new insight into the distribution of proteins within these databases and the information that may be contained within a protein s primary amino acid sequence 
Our focus in this quest has been to examine specific pairs or triplets of residues and use probability theory to assess whether or not particular strings of residues occur more frequently than their probability would indicate 
By analyzing affinity and anti affinity  we developed a procedure to search out all two  and three residue clusters within these databases 
Through this technique  we can rapidly classify large groups of proteins into families based on the occurrence of these motifs 
Combining this concept with a specific knowledge of protein function  we propose novel ideas aimed at developing fast detection methods for specific diseases based on the unusually high occurrence of some of these motifs when compared with the expected probabilities 
A timely example of the application of this method is given  namely the analysis of the SARS virus 
This method will hopefully lead to the discovery of new diagnostic techniques and possible treatment of diseases  by recognizing the location of target domains in the expressed sequence Cell type specific expression of the putative SARS CoV  receptor ACE  in human heartsThe coronavirus disease    COVID  caused by SARS CoV  infections imposes a major threat for the world s healthcare systems and is leading to thousands of deaths 
Angiotensin converting enzyme    ACE  has been identified as a potential receptor for SARS coronavirus  and is also considered the main receptor for SARS CoV  SARS CoV  binds to ACE  via its glycosylated outer membrane spike proteins 
ACE  is highly expressed in the lung and heart  and is known for its vital role in the cardiovascular system –  Although SARS CoV  mainly invades alveolar epithelial cells  it can also cause myocardial injury  as assessed by increased troponin T and NT proBNP levels accompanying increased cardiovascular symptoms in COVID infected patients  It is unclear whether elevated biomarkers of cardiac injury  or long term effects on the cardiovascular system  are directly caused by viral infection of cardiac tissue or are secondary to hypoxia and systemic inflammation 
However  patients with underlying cardiovascular disease represent a significant proportion of the patients who may suffer from a severe course after COVID  infection  This situation may be aggravated by findings showing that ACE inhibitors  which are often used to treat cardiovascular diseases  augment the expression of the SARS CoV  receptor ACE  in lung cells  This is probably mediated by an effect on angiotensin II  which is known to reduce ACE  expression  Thus  ACE inhibition decreases angiotensin II  leading to an indirect up regulation of ACE  The effect of angiotensin II receptor blockers  ARBs  which primarily target the angiotensin receptor   is unclear 
One may speculate that ARBs indirectly reduce ACE  levels by augmenting free angiotensin II levels  which in turn is expected to down regulate ACE  via activating the angiotensin receptor  
However  the effect of the two different treatments on the expression of ACE  in the heart requires further investigation Therefore  we used single nuclei RNA sequencing to determine the expression of ACE and ACE  in the different cell types of the human heart 
Gene expression signatures were detected in cardiac tissues of five patients with aortic stenosis  AS  and two patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction  HFrEF   Figure  A  and compared with with samples of one healthy donor heart  age    years  male  that was not used for transplantation 
After single nuclei RNA sequencing  data were pooled  and unsupervised clustering was performed with a total of     nuclei 
We found   distinct clusters 
Using cell type specific gene markers  major cell types were annotated  including cardiomyocytes  six clusters  fibroblasts  one cluster  endothelial cells  three clusters  leucocytes  two clusters  pericytes  one cluster  and smooth muscle cells  one cluster   Figure  B–D 
ACE  was expressed in cardiomyocytes  Cluster   and   and mural cells  particularly pericytes  Cluster   and was detected at a lower expression level in fibroblasts  endothelial cell  and leucocytes  Figure  D 
Comparison of ACE  in a pooled analysis of nuclei of the different groups showed that ACE  was significantly elevated in cardiomyocytes of patients with heart disease compared with healthy controls  Figure  E 
ACE  was also slightly  but not significantly  increased in endothelial cells  and the expression was lower in fibroblasts of patients with heart disease compared with healthy controls  Figure  E 
Immunostaining confirmed an increased expression of ACE  in cardiomyocytes of patients with aortic stenosis  Figure  F 
In addition  ACE was augmented in cardiomyocytes of patients with AS and HFrEF  Figure  G 
Interestingly  cardiomyocytes of patients who were treated with ACE inhibitors showed a significantly higher ACE  expression compared with ARB treated patients  Figure  H 
Moreover  patients treated with ACE inhibitors had an imbalance of ACE to ACE  expression  with a more than four fold higher ACE ACE  ratio compared with healthy control cells  Figure  I In conclusion  these data provide novel insights into the cell type specific expression and regulation of ACE  in the heart 
Patients with varying heart disease aetiology show augmented expression of ACE  levels particularly in cardiomyocytes 
Treatment with ACE inhibitors tends to be associated with increased ACE  mRNA and unfavourable ACE ACE  ratios  which are believed to be a driver of cardiovascular pathologies  This study is limited by its small sample size and therefore is only hypothesis generating 
However  these novel data suggest that it will be important to monitor SARS CoV infected patients for cardiovascular complications and assess the impact of ARB ACE inhibitor therapy 
Conflict of interest  none declared New onset acute symptomatic seizure and risk factors in coronavirus disease   A retrospective multicenter studyIn December   pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus  later called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus    SARS‐CoV‐  was first reported in Wuhan  China 
On March     the World Health Organization  WHO  declared the syndrome caused by SARS‐CoV‐  infection  coronavirus disease    COVID‐  a pandemic 
According to a WHO Situation Report of April    
 
 there are   confirmed COVID‐  cases and   deaths globally 
COVID‐  affects people of all ages 
 
  
 
 and in severe cases  it may cause dyspnea  hypoxia  acute respiratory distress syndrome  and septic shock 
 
  
 

The current situation has raised concerns regarding whether people with epilepsy have a higher risk to be infected with COVID‐  and whether people would develop acute seizures during the course of COVID‐ 
The objective of this study is to clarify the incidence and the risk of acute symptomatic seizures during acute COVID‐  infections This retrospective multicenter study was approved by the ethics committee of West China Hospital  Sichuan University  approval   
The study was conducted in   officially designed hospitals in Hubei province  the epicenter of the COVID‐  epidemic in China  Sichuan province  and Chongqing municipality 
These hospitals included the East Branch of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University  West China Ward  Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital  and hospitals in Sichuan province designated by the government to treat COVID‐   see the list of hospitals in Appendix S People with COVID‐  who were discharged from or died in the participating hospitals between January   and February     were consecutively enrolled 
All cases were diagnosed according to the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for COVID‐   trial version  
 
 All those enrolled tested positive through nucleic acid detection 
Disease severity was classified as mild  moderate  severe  or critical according to the national guidelines  see Box   for classification criteria 
 
 For our study  we aggregated severe and critical cases into a single severe group  whereas mild and moderate cases were aggregated into a single milder group 
The clinical outcome at discharge was either cured or death Electronic medical records of all enrolled cases were reviewed by   neurologists using a standard case report form  Appendix S 
Data were extracted on demographic characteristics  medical history  complications  treatments  and presence of risk factors for seizures 
These risk factors were considered to be the following  acute cerebrovascular disease  traumatic brain injury  TBI  central nervous system  CNS  infection  shock  hypoxia  severe metabolic disturbance  based on criteria from the International League Against Epilepsy
 
  multiple‐organ dysfunction syndrome  sepsis  and exposure to drugs or toxic substances Continuous variables were presented as median  interquartile range  and categorical variables as n  All of   people discharged from or who died at participating hospitals were consecutively identified and enrolled 
Most were from Sichuan province  n     followed by Chongqing  n     and Hubei  n    Ten individuals died  giving case fatality rates of    n     in Hubei     n     in Chongqing  and    n     in Sichuan 
Of the   severe cases      received mechanical ventilation  and     were given sedatives 
Apart from the effect of sedatives  mental state was relatively normal in   people 
Eight were encephalopathic  one was obtunded  one was delirious  and six were comatose 
The diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus was not made in any of these cases based on clinical presentation  results of investigations  or response to therapy 
No routine or long‐term electroencephalogram  EEG  was recorded due to exposure concerns None in this cohort had a past history of epilepsy 
None had any seizures  including febrile seizures  or status epilepticus during hospitalization 
Seizurelike events were seen in two people  it was believed that this was the result of an acute stress reaction in one and hypocalcemia in the other The first was a  ‐year‐old woman who reported bilateral bodily spasms lasting for about   minute  with mouth deviation but no impairment of awareness 
She was evaluated neurologically and psychiatrically and was diagnosed with an acute anxiety disorder  which was treated with olanzapine  paroxetine  and diazepam The second case was a  ‐year‐old woman who displayed bilateral myoclonus in the limbs with no impairment in consciousness   hours after admission 
Although this was initially suspected to represent seizures  she was found to have an electrolyte disturbance including hyponatremia  hypokalemia  and hypocalcemia  and the myoclonus resolved with correction of the metabolic disturbances Eighty‐four   cases reported systemic or direct brain insults that increased their risk for acute symptomatic seizures  Table  
The most common risk factor was hypoxia 
No severe electrolyte disturbance was seen  but hypokalemia  n       hyponatremia  n       and hypocalcemia  n       were frequently seen in the cohort 
Urea  creatinine  and serum glucose levels were moderately altered in most of cases 
In two cases who had chronic kidney dysfunction  substantial increases in creatinine levels were noted 
Results of investigations are shown in Table  
One case with TBI had an epidural hematoma  cerebral contusion  and skull base fracture 
Five people with severe COVID‐  experienced septic shock 
Three other cases of shock had hypovolemia or cardiac problems 
Ninety‐four   were given antibiotics  moxifloxacin  n       piperacillin sulbactam sodium  n       and third‐generation cephalosporins  n       were most commonly used We found no new onset seizures or status epilepticus in a large cohort of people hospitalized during the acute phase of COVID   infection despite a substantial proportion having risk factors for acute symptomatic seizures 
This is useful information  given the prior lack of knowledge about seizure risk during the acute phase of infection No individual in this cohort had a history of epilepsy prior to hospital admission 
To date  there is not much information available on people with epilepsy during the COVID‐  crisis 
There is one report of epilepsy in a case COVID‐  from Wuhan 
 
 As information is limited  it is not possible to establish whether this was a patient who had a history of epilepsy or whether the patient presented acute seizures 
There is at this time little if any evidence indicating that people with epilepsy are at an increased risk of COVID‐  infection 
A major challenge for people with epilepsy in this outbreak is nonadherence with the prescribed antiseizure medication  which was seen during the in SARS endemic in  
 
 This indicates the need to ensure the availability of supplies of medications and to advocate patients  self‐management 
Possible strategies for coping could also include online consultations and telemedicine networks Although many neurological and systemic disorders regarded as potential triggers
 
 of acute symptomatic seizures were identified in this cohort  seizures and status were not seen 
Stroke is one such risk factor 
The risk of developing acute symptomatic seizures after stroke ranges from   to  
 
 Acute cerebrovascular disease is considered a major cause of seizure and status epilepticus 
An earlier study from Hubei
 
  
 
 also reported six people with COVID‐  who had acute cerebrovascular disease without seizure 
Infection of the CNS can also give rise to seizures 
Although there is limited evidence of the presence of the SARS‐CoV‐  in the cerebrospinal fluid  CSF  the co‐occurrence of tubercular meningitis
 
 had been reported  with no seizure or status observed 
To determine whether COVID‐  can cause direct CNS insults requires further follow‐up 
In the earlier outbreaks of another coronavirus  a generalized convulsion with a positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for SARS‐CoV in CSF was reported  which could have been a coincidence 
 

Disturbances of homeostasis may lead to acute symptomatic seizures 
Hypoxia  the most common complication in our cohort  may trigger anoxic encephalopathy  particularly in refractory hypoxia 
Electrolyte disturbances as seen in COVID‐  are considered to be potential causes of acute symptomatic seizure 
 
 The severity and speed of such disturbances may affect onset of seizures  so these parameters should be carefully monitored The cytokine storm syndromes
 
 behind severe infection may cause the production of inflammatory cytokines systemically  with the consequence of acute toxic encephalopathies 
Although sepsis is a common cause of encephalopathy in intensive care medicine 
 
 hypoxia appears far more often than sepsis in COVID‐ 
There was also a high rate of septic shock in the COVID‐  population  varying from  
 
 to   in earlier studies in Hubei 
 
  
 

Certain antibiotics have been associated with symptomatic seizure 
 
 Antibiotics were used in a large number of people in our cohort without problems  but the most used antibiotics in the cohort were of low or moderate risk 
Clinicians should keep this seizure risk in mind when prescribing antibiotics  especially for people with renal dysfunction 
 

Our study has several limitations 
First  as a cross‐sectional study  we only have data from the acute phase of the disease 
A follow‐up study is underway to evaluate longitudinal seizure outcomes 
Second  the retrospective study design meant that we could not collect data on all relevant variables  for example  EEG was not recorded  so subclinical seizures could have been missed 
As all health care costs of COVID‐  treatment are covered by the government  all those suspected of infection are screened 
This may assure the objectivity and reliability of study materials  and it will allow for a future follow‐up study Our analysis suggests that COVID‐  poses minimal risk for seizures during the acute illness  although a significant proportion of severely ill individuals have risk factors that may increase the propensity to experience seizures 
These risk factors should be promptly addressed to minimize the risk of developing seizures 
Prospective long‐term studies must be done to determine whether people who have suffered from COVID‐  have an increased risk for developing seizures or epilepsy in subsequent months or years as a consequence of their illness None of the authors has any conflict of interest to disclose 
We confirm that we have read the Journal s position on issues involved in ethical publication and affirm that this report is consistent with those guidelines Decreased prealbumin level is associated with increased risk of mortality in hospitalized elderly patients with COVID The coronavirus disease    COVID  epidemic is caused by an infection with a novel coronavirus  officially named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus    SARS COV 
The infection spread rapidly on all continents and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization 
As of April       documented cases were reported worldwide  and   patients had died 
As there are currently no specific treatments and medications against the new virus  it is crucial to identify risk factors of severe prognosis Older patients have poorer prognostic factors and are more likely to experience critical disease 
 
 
Based on recent statistical data of China  among patients who were   years and older  the mortality rate was   which was significantly higher than that of younger patients at  
The proportion of deaths over   years old accounts for   of the total deaths in the national wide  which implicates aged people are more vulnerable to the SARS CoV 
Till present there are rare reports in literature focusing on the risk factors for poor outcomes of the elderly patients with COVID Serum prealbumin  known as transthyretin  its levels may be lowered not only by malnutrition  but also by inflammation and aging 
 
 
Compared to albumin  prealbumin has a shorter half life  a more rapid rate of hepatic synthesis  and predictable catabolic rate  hence  it may be a more sensitive indicator 
However  whether prealbumin could be an independent predictor of mortality in hospitalized COVID  elderly patients needs to be further elucidated The present study aims to describe the clinical characteristics and to investigate whether the prealbumin can serve as a valuable predictor of in hospital mortality  which might provide evidence for the risk stratification in elderly and help to improve the clinical practice and reduce fatality We designed this study as a retrospective cohort study design 
The elderly patients with COVID  who were admitted to Tongji Hospital in Wuhan from January   to February     were consecutively included 
This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Tongji Hospital  Approval Number  TJ IRB  and was complied with the Declaration of Helsinki 
The data were anonymous and the study was observational  so the informed consent was not gathered 
A flow diagram illustrating patient selection was described in Figure  
 
Inclusion criteria included elderly patients  ≥   years old  diagnosed with COVID  infection 
A total of   participants have been obtained 
Patients having missing baseline or outcome data  died on admission or being transferred to other designated hospitals during hospitalization were excluded 
There were   patients were included in the final analyses Data collection of participants was performed using hospital electronic medical record system 
Information included medical history  demographic data  physical examination  and hematological  biochemical  radiological and microbiological evaluation results were reviewed 
The data collection forms were reviewed independently by   researchers  CL and LYY 
Blood examinations were assessed at the central laboratory of Tongji Hospital following standard operative procedures 
The routine blood test was analyzed using Sysmex XE  hematology analyzer  Sysmex  Kobe  Japan 
The Cobas C   Roche  Mannheim  Germany  was used to measure the biochemical parameters 
Coagulation tests were detected by STA R MAX coagulation analyzer  Diagnostica Stago  Saint Denis  France 
Throat swab samples were collected and were tested for SARS CoV  with commercial real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  RT PCR  kit from DAAN GENE  Guangzhou  China 
The diagnostic criteria and all clinical procedures in this study followed  Diagnosis and Treatment of Pneumonia Caused by New Coronavirus  Trial version   to   promulgated by the National Health and Health Commission of China Summary statistics of baseline characteristics of all patients and stratification by prealbumin tertiles were expressed as frequency and proportion for categorical variables  mean   standard deviation  SD   Gaussian distribution  or median  range   Skewed distribution  for continuous variables  and as percentages for categorical variables 
The differences between groups were analyzed using the χ   categorical variables  One Way ANOVA test  normal distribution  or Kruskal Whallis H test  skewed distribution We examined the relationship of the prealbumin as categorized into tertiles with the outcomes of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation 
Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to evaluate these relationships  then unadjusted and adjusted odds ratio  ORs  and   confidence intervals  CIs  were calculated 
Model   is the minimally adjusted model with only sociodemographic variables adjusted 
Model   is the fully adjusted model with covariates including age  sex  smoking status  history of hypertension  history of coronary heart disease  history of diabetes  history of chronic kidney disease  history of carcinoma  history of chronic liver disease  neutrophil  lymphocyte  prothrombin time  activated partial thromboplastin time  d dimer  alanine transaminase  aspartate aminotransferase  total bilirubin  blood urea nitrogen  creatinine  C reactive protein and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio 
We calculated odds ratio  ORs  and   confidence intervals  CIs 
The highest tertile was the reference for prealbumin 
We performed test for linear trend by entering the median value of each category of prealbumin tertile as continuous variable to examine the possibility of nonlinearity To ensure the robustness of our results  we also performed stratified analyses with the prealbumin as a continuous variable for the overall population and stratified by gender  age  hypertension status and coronary heart disease status at baseline 
Generalized additive models were used to visually confirm the relationship between prealbumin as continuous variable and the risk of outcomes  all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation Modeling was performed with the statistical software packages R  http www R project org  The R Foundation  and EmpowerStats  http www empowerstats com  X Y Solutions  Inc  Boston  MA 
P values less than    two sided  were considered statistically significant In our study    cases were excluded 
To avoid selection bias due to missing data  we performed a sensitivity analysis 
The results showed that there was no statistical difference between missing group and non missing group  supplemental table  Of   elderly inpatients included in the final analysis  the mean age was     years  ranging from   years to   years  and most patients were male  table  
 
The baseline characteristics of these included participants were listed in table 
The day of sample drawing after admission was       day 
No significant statistical difference in sex  smoking status  body weight  BMI  comorbidity  hypertension  coronary heart disease  chronic kidney disease  cerebral vascular disease  carcinoma  chronic liver disease  symptoms  fever  cough  headache  diarrhea and myalgia fatigue at admission  were detected across different groups of prealbumin  tertile 
When compared with subjects in the highest tertile  those in the lowest tertile were older  more likely to have diabetes medical history  with higher Neutrophil count  lower lymphocyte count  worse coagulation function and liver function 
A total of     patients required mechanical ventilation      patients admitted to intensive care unit and     patients died during hospitalization 
The incidence of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation were significantly decreased across prealbumin tertiles  all cause death    vs    vs    for tertile   vs  tertile   vs  tertile   ICU admission    vs    vs    for tertile   vs  tertile   vs  tertile   mechanical ventilation    vs    vs    for tertile   vs  tertile   vs  tertile   respectively To investigate the correlation between prealbumin and in hospital outcomes  we constructed three models using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models  table  
 
In the unadjusted model  the ORs of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation was significantly increased as the prealbumin tertiles downgraded 
The OR for tertile   was significantly higher than the OR for tertile    OR       CI    to   P   for all cause death  OR       CI    to   P   for ICU admission  OR       CI    to   P   for mechanical ventilation 
Additional adjustment for the demographic variables and comorbidities did not reduce the ORs for the association between prealbumin tertiles and in hospital outcomes 
Further adjusting for the baseline levels of blood examinations  including blood routine  neutrophil  lymphocyte  neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio  coagulation function  prothrombin time  activated partial thromboplastin time  d dimer  liver fuction  alanine transaminase  aspartate aminotransferase  total bilirubin  renal function  blood urea nitrogen  creatinine  and infection indicators  C reactive protein  did not affect the relationships in the fully adjusted models  OR       CI    to   P   for all cause death  OR       CI    to   P   for ICU admission  OR       CI    to   P     for mechanical ventilation 
Therefore  lower tertile of prealbumin exhibited an increased risk of worse in hospital outcomes  full adjusted P for trend for all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation  P     P   and P     respectively Generalized additive models  Fig  
A through  C  were used to visually assess functional relationships between the prealbumin as continuous variate and the risk of in hospital outcomes 
Serum prealbumin was found to have negative linear relationship with the risk of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation To determine the consistency of the relationship between baseline prealbumin as a continuous variable and in hospital outcomes  we conducted stratified analyses  Table  
 
For each unit increase of prealbumin  the adjusted OR for all cause death was   in males  P     and   in females  P    
The adjusted OR for all cause death for persons less than   years of age was    P     compared with    p     for persons   years and older  P interaction    
For each unit increase of the prealbumin  the OR for all cause death was    P     and    P     for normotensives and hypertensives     P     and    P     for non diabetic and diabetes respectively 
The difference of interaction was not significant between two groups  P interaction         and   stratified for gender  age  hypertention and diabetes respectively 
Moreover  the relationship between baseline prealbumin with ICU admission and mechanical ventilation stratified by gender  age  hypertention and diabetes are consistent In this study  we found that lower serum prealbumin significantly associated with an increased risk of worse outcomes and all cause death during hospitalization 
Patients in the lowest tertile of prealbumin were older  and with higher Neutrophil count  lower lymphocyte count  worse coagulation function and liver function compared with subjects in the highest tertile 
Then we adjusted relevant covariates including age  sex  smoking status  comorbidities  neutrophil  lymphocyte  coagulation function  liver function  renal function and C reactive protein to minimize the potential impact of confounding 
Compared with crude regression analyses  this association still persisted when adjusting for demographic and clinical variables in the multivariable regression analyses 
Moreover  stratified by gender  age  hypertension and diabetes  increased level of serum prealbumin was associated with the decreased risk of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation  which determine the consistency of the relationship between lowest serum prealbumin tertile and the increased risk of worse outcomes in elderly COVID  patients Several previous studies have demonstrated baseline prealbumin change in COVID  patients 
Decreased level of prealbumin was observed among COVID  patients 
Wu C et al investigated   patients with COVID  and observed that prealbumin was associated with the development of ARDS  indicating the potential value of prealbumin level on COVID  clinical ending 
Till date  no report exists on the effect of prealbumin in COVID  elderly patients High proportion of severe to critical cases and high fatality rate were observed in the elderlyCOVID  patients  and rapid disease progress was noted in the dead 
One possible explanation involves the greater potential of seniors to be in a state of inflammation  nutritional deficiency and other complications 
Prealbumin is a globular  non glycosilated protein  synthesized by the liver  and complexed with a retinol binding protein  which acts as a transporter of retinol vitamin A and thyroid hormones 
Low plasma prealbumin level has far back emerged as an earliest laboratory indicator of poor nutritional status 
 
 
In addition  prealbumin are also associated with inflammation 
Previous studies showed that in response to the inflammation  the body responds by synthesizing a large number of cytokines 
These include interleukins and tumor necrosis factors that down regulate  decrease  plasma concentrations of albumin and prealbumin 
 
 
Therefore  assay of serum prealbumin concentration is recommended by some investigators as a screening marker for both malnutrition and inflammation Elderly with low plasma prealbumin levels mean that those people are at greater risk of malnutrition and inflammatory conditions  which may lead to poor prognosis 
Malnutrition is commonly seen in hospitalized patients in both the developed and developing world  especially among elderly patients 
A review of   published studies of acute care patients reported that malnutrition incidence ranged from  –  of hospitalized elderly 
It was found that compared to non famine regions of India  experiencing famine had significantly higher influenza mortality rates during the   Influenza pandemic 
Aging  frailty  and chronic diseases are associated with impaired immune function and are compounded by immune dysregulation from malnutrition 
When immune response is dysregulated  it would result in an excessive inflammation  even death 
In the current COVID  study  it was found that elderly patients have higher levels of white blood cells counts  CRP  inflammatory cytokines and are more likely to experience critical disease than did those younger patients 
 
 This retrospective cohort study included   elderly COVID  patients  until the date of February       of patients required mechanical ventilation    of patients admitted to intensive care unit  and the total in hospital mortality was  
The mortality rate was lower than that reported by wang L et al  among elderly COVID  patients 
This may have been the reason for some patients at the date of February     are still in hospital 
Nevertheless  this would not bias the relationship between prealbumin and in hospital outcomes because of the definite observation time we set previously 
Moreover  Wuhan tongji Hospital as one of the largest third grade Class A hospitals equipped with advanced life support training and equipment may partly account for the moderate mortality The results of this study have several clinical implications and strengths 
A low prealbumin concentration can therefore be regarded primarily as a signal identifying the at risk elderly patient who would suffer worse outcomes and requires careful assessment and monitoring for whom nutritional support and Inflammation detection may be needed as part of the treatment plan 
As observational study was susceptible to various confounders  we adjusted many variables that may affect the relationship between prealbumin and in hospital outcomes to minimize potential confounding 
In addition  we tested the robustness of the results by repeating the analyses in different subgroups of gender  age  history of hypertension and history of diabetes Our study has some limitations 
First  by including patients still in hospital as of J February     the case fatality ratio in our study cannot reflect the true mortality of elderly COVID 
Second  the record of data may be affected by prehospital medication and the time interval between admission and onset 
Third  since all subjects in our study were hospitalized Chinese elderly patients diagnosed with COVID  results of this study might not directly be applied to other ethnicities and age groups In conclusion  this retrospective cohort study revealed that the prealbumin is an independent risk factor for the in hospital mortality in the Chinese COVID  elderly patients 
Nutritional support and Inflammation detection should be careful assessment and monitoring for the elderly patients with low prealbumin concentration

Coping With COVID  Emergency Stress  Secondary Trauma and Self Efficacy in Healthcare and Emergency Workers in ItalyThe coronavirus disease  COVID  or the acute respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus    SARS CoV  began spreading in China at the end of   and  to date  represents an international health emergency without precedents in terms of its health  economic  and organizational effects on people s lives  World Health Organization   
After China  Italy was the first country to be affected by this epidemic  with the first deaths on February     and a rapid increase in the spread of infection and mortality 
COVID  was first detected in Northern Italy  and it then spread  although at different rates of incidence  to the other regions 
It was immediately evident that healthcare and emergency workers were at great risk of contagion and that protection and intervention protocols needed to be introduced in the absence of adequate points of reference because of the exceptional nature of the epidemic  the rate of spread of the infection  the seriousness of patients  health condition  and the mortality index 
The extreme conditions in which health workers have had to work  especially in the most affected regions in Northern Italy  are indicated by the following data from the Italian National Institute of Health   over   doctors died and   other health workers were infected within the general context of the population of   deaths and   infections in a span of   weeks 
It was also clear that the medical staff would experience serious psychological repercussions because of the working conditions as well as the difficulty of having scientific points of reference on care and intervention procedures 
To this must be added the increase in workload  the extension of working hours and  for health workers  the frequent exposure to the suffering and death of their patients 
Therefore  healthcare and emergency workers were subjected to serious psychological as well as physical stress 
Hence  the aim of this study  which was also the aim of a previous study  Vagni et al    is to focus on the similarities and the differences in the stress management of two professional groups healthcare and emergency workers during the acute phase of the pandemic 
Both groups have had to deal with COVID patients as frontline responders and have been exposed to the related risks of infection and psychological consequences  which  to date  have not been examined in detail through a comparative analysis As regards the stress that they experience  the literature clearly explains that healthcare and emergency workers who intervene in emergency situations are exposed to the risk of developing dysfunctional reactions that can be identified at different levels physical and or physiological  e g  psychosomatic disorders  sleep wake cycle alterations  and sense of tiredness  emotional  e g  irritability  nervousness  agitation  anger  low self esteem  and guilt  cognitive  e g  distractibility  sense of ineffectiveness  and negative anticipation of events  and relational  e g  increase in conflicts within emergency teams and or with their organization institution  and social withdrawal and may also develop reactions from secondary trauma  Del Missier et al    Sbattella    Argentero and Setti    Fraccaroli and Balducci    Bellelli and Di Schiena    Walton et al   
Faced with stressful events regarding which they lack previous experience and specific  necessary knowledge  and which cause tension owing to the need for rapid decision timings and a sense of responsibility  emergency workers may experience a sense of decision ineffectiveness 
In fact  emergency situations are characterized by high levels of decisional and operational uncertainty with associated regret and guilt  Del Missier et al   Several studies have highlighted that insufficient instructions and a lack of personal protective equipment  PPE  are important predictors of stress for healthcare and emergency workers in large scale emergencies  Oh et al    Du et al    El Hage et al    Walton et al   
Oh et al 
  highlighted that nurses involved in managing the Middle East respiratory syndrome  MERS  experienced lower levels of stress when the levels of goods supply and hospital training were higher 
Some studies have highlighted that frontline healthcare workers had lower secondary traumatization scores than non frontline health workers and the general public in contrast to the findings of previous research on the SARS outbreak in the same area in Singapore  Chan and Huak   
According to Barleycorn   and Tan et al 
  these results may be due to the dedicated training and psychological support given to healthcare workers after the SARS outbreak and demonstrate the validity of policy strategies for prevention of stress in the psychological health field An analysis of   studies published from January to March   aimed at investigating the stress experience of healthcare workers in facing COVID  shows that health workers experienced symptoms of depression and anxiety related to this stressful experience 
Moreover  the severity of their symptoms was influenced by their age  gender  role  specialization  type of activity performed  and exposure to patients with COVID  however  prevention  resilience  and social support interventions mediated their response to stress  Bohlken et al   
In a review of the literature  Spoorthy   underlined that sociodemographic variables  such as age  gender  profession  and workplace  and psychological variables  such as poor social support and self efficacy  affect the stress level experienced by health workers 
In addition  COVID  emerged as an independent stress risk factor 
Xiao et al 
  found that social support plays a role in reducing the anxiety levels in medical staff and increases their sense of self efficacy According to Walton et al 
  the specific stressors that health workers face in the COVID  emergency are related to the organizational context 
The challenges for medical staff include not only an increased workload but also a fear of infection  the need to work with new protocols that change frequently  and the use of PPE 
In uncontrollable situations such as a pandemic  when specific action protocols are absent and limited resources are available  health workers must make individual decisions with a heavy burden of responsibility that may be contrary to their moral principles 
For example  in the case of COVID  they may have to choose which patients to save because only a few places are available in intensive care 
In this regard  Cai et al 
  showed that for a sample of   healthcare professionals who worked closely with COVID  patients in Hubei  the most stressful factors were the lack of protocols for the treatment of COVID  the scarcity of PPE  the exhausting work shifts  their concern about the risk of infection  and their exposure to the death and suffering of their patients 
They also found that the support of superiors proved to be one of the most important motivational factors for medical staff  and the presence of clear guidelines and effective safety protocols were protective factors against the development of stress  in particular  for females 
Further  Walton et al 
  identified the organizational stressors as the changes in work shifts  the prevalence of night shifts  an excessive workload  staff roles  autonomy  the lack of support from superiors  and the absence of adequate information and clear instructions 
On the basis of these stressors  they estimated that   of the medical staff working on the front line of this pandemic are at risk of developing post traumatic stress disorder  PTSD 
In addition  limited resources  longer shifts  decreased hours of rest  and the occupational risks associated with COVID  exposure have increased the physical and mental fatigue  stress  anxiety  and burnout of these staff members  Sasangohar et al   The loss of a social support network  which can be an important resilience factor  is another risk factor  Ozbay et al   
In the COVID  emergency  healthcare and emergency workers have often experienced a separation from their affective links  either because of the restrictions on social contacts imposed by the lockdown or the fear of spreading the infection to their family members 
To this must be added that although  at first  health workers received unanimous encouragement from the population  later  they also experienced demonstrations of stigma and isolation 
Some studies have shown that being able to resort to their own social support network is a significant protective factor for health workers dealing with this emergency  Cai et al   As Favretto   stated  when individuals experience situations that go beyond their coping strategies  their vulnerability to  and risk of developing  psychopathological reactions increases 
Studies conducted during previous epidemics  such as the SARS  MERS  and Ebola epidemics  converge in detecting how healthcare and emergency workers may experience extremely high levels of stress and even develop secondary traumatic stress or vicarious trauma 
This trauma is defined as an experience of symptoms similar to those found in people with PTSD  such as in emergency nurses working with traumatized patients  Beck   
Figley   defined it as a form of stress that derives from the feelings of empathy experienced when helping traumatized people 
The symptoms may include intrusive recurring thoughts  disturbed sleep  fatigue  physical symptoms  hyperarousal  increased stress response  anxiety  depression  and feeling emotional  Adriaenssens et al   
Wolf et al 
  described how nurses may feel  overwhelmed  and this condition becomes a source of moral distress that triggers feelings of powerlessness  guilt  fear  anger  and frustration The sense of frustration and impotence felt by nurses when they are unable to treat and save a patient has been highlighted as a risk factor for secondary traumatic stress in several studies  Missouridou   
Avoidance and emotional numbing can become tools for self protection from intrusive symptoms that exceed the personal tolerance level  Coetzee and Klopper    Mealer and Jones   
Their frustration obviously intensifies on a patient s death 
The onset of PTSD in the health workers involved in treating MERS was also detected after the acute phase of the emergency was over  highlighting a risk not only in the immediate period but also in the medium term period  Lee et al   In reference to COVID  updated studies conducted on Chinese health workers have already highlighted the strong impact of the epidemic on the psychological health of doctors and nurses 
Some studies have found that healthcare workers have high levels of anxiety  depression  insomnia  and distress  Lai et al    Li et al    Zhu et al   
In particular  female professionals with more than   years of experience and previous psychiatric pathology present more risk factors of developing the symptoms of stress  anxiety  and depression  Lai et al    Zhu et al   
Huang J 
Z  et al 
  studied stress levels during the COVID  emergency in a sample of medical staff 
They found that females showed higher levels of anxiety and PTSD than males did and that the levels were higher for nurses than for doctors 
Moreover  Li et al 
  found that nurses had developed higher levels of vicarious trauma than those of the general population and that nurses who did not work closely with COVID  patients showed a more severe symptomatology  both physical and psychological  compared with their colleagues working on the frontline emergency services 
In Italy  a study conducted on healthcare workers found that doctors and nurses developed high levels of stress and anxiety  greater than those developed by the general population  and that healthcare workers operating in the North  the area of Italy most affected by the virus  showed a more severe symptomatology  Simione and Gnagnarella   
This study also confirmed that females tend to have a greater perception of the risk of infection  which increases their risk of developing the symptoms of anxiety and distress Because of their long  intense exposure to various stressors  it is important to note the nature of the coping strategies used by these healthcare and emergency workers in these situations and their effectiveness in terms of reducing and effectively coping with stress 
Indeed  the effective management of stress levels in the acute emergency phase could reduce the risk of developing long term PTSD or other pathologies  such as anxiety and depression  Fullerton et al    Slottje et al    Argentero and Setti    Sakuma et al    Birinci and Erden    Li et al   
Coping may be defined as a series of cognitive and behavioral efforts to manage specific internal or external issues that test or exceed individual resources  Lazarus and Folkman   
A distinction can be made between problem focused and emotion focused coping strategies 
The former is aimed at modifying and solving the stressful situation through active interventions 
By contrast  emotion focused coping is aimed at managing the emotions connected to the stressful event and regulating affective reactions  such as anxiety and the tension of response to stress  for example  by trying to avoid the threat  denial  or re evaluating it  reappraisal The choice of coping strategies is influenced by the individual s cognitive evaluation of the event  termed secondary evaluation  which involves estimating the resources available and the most effective strategies to deal with the situation  Lazarus and Folkman   
A key element of this assessment is the extent to which the individual can maintain control over the outcome of the situation 
The literature indicates that individuals apply dysfunctional coping when they face an uncontrollable event by responding primarily with a coping strategy focused on the problem  and conversely  when they face a controllable situation  they respond with coping strategies focused on emotions  Strentz and Auerbach    Vitaliano et al   
A coping strategy may be defined as adaptive when the controllability of the stressful event corresponds with the choice of coping strategy  in this case  the subject will experience fewer symptoms related to stress  Park et al   The strategies used to cope with trauma may differ among individuals  but they can also vary according to the profession and the features of the traumatic event  Nydegger et al   
Individuals differ in their choice of coping strategies  Connor Smith and Flachsbart    and factors related to the situation can also have a decisive influence on such choice  Brown et al   
A few studies have considered the ways in which gender influences the perception of stress in emergency situations and the choice of coping strategy 
These studies highlight that females tend to perceive events as more negative and uncontrollable and to resort more to coping strategies focused on emotions and avoidance  whereas males tend to resort more to applying problem focused coping and to inhibiting emotions  Matud    Matud et al    Matud and Garcia   The literature on the relationship between coping strategies and the stress levels of emergency workers has shown that the use of coping strategies focused on the problem usually tends to correlate with lower stress levels  both in healthcare workers  Watson et al    Howlett et al    and in other emergency workers  such as firefighters  Brown et al   
However  a coping strategy frequently used by emergency workers is that of avoidance and minimization  and this strategy is associated with higher levels of stress  Brown et al    Chang et al    Kerai et al    Witt et al    Theleritis et al   
Loo et al 
  found that in a group of emergency workers  avoidance as well as coping strategies focused on emotions were associated with the development of post traumatic symptomatology 
Rodríguez Rey et al 
  revealed that among health workers working in a pediatric emergency department  approximately   of the variance in PTSD was explained by the frequent use of coping strategies focused on emotions and the infrequent use of those focused on the problem 
In addition  Kucmin et al 
  who considered a sample of   paramedics  highlighted that the risk of developing PTSD symptoms was predicted by the use of coping strategies focused on emotions However  the literature does not offer unanimous results 
Chamberlin and Green   found that in a group of firefighters  all coping strategies actually correlated with high levels of stress  the authors explained this finding by suggesting that it is not the individual coping strategies that are maladaptive in themselves  but that greater effort is needed to adjust in stressful situations 
By contrast  Young et al 
  indicated that firefighters use problem focused coping strategies more often at the beginning of the operation and emotion focused coping strategies more commonly in the phase of breakdown and fatigue 
However  after the incident  they use both strategies  Young et al   
A meta analysis by Shin et al 
  highlighted that different coping strategies have different effects on work burnout  in particular  emotional stress and depersonalization are associated with the use of emotion focused coping strategies  whereas professional ineffectiveness is associated with the use of problem focused strategies Further  a few studies have investigated the coping strategies that emergency workers can use during health emergencies similar to COVID 
Maunder et al 
  revealed that healthcare professionals who tended to apply dysfunctional coping strategies  based on avoidance  hostile comparison  or self blame  tended to develop higher stress levels 
Wong et al 
  highlighted that during the SARS epidemic  doctors and nurses tended to use different coping strategies 
The doctors tended to turn more to action planning  but this strategy did not affect their stress level 
Instead  their stress level was positively correlated with their use of coping strategies based on emotional outlets 
By contrast  the nursing staff tended to resort more to behavioral disengagement and distraction strategies  which  however  correlated with higher levels of stress among them In this regard  during the MERS epidemic  hospital staff tended to adopt coping strategies related to the use of PPE and the adoption of all prevention measures  as well as social support  whereas the coping strategy that they adopted the least was that based on an emotional outlet  Khalid et al   
A recent study on healthcare workers in Hubei  China  during the COVID  epidemic  Cai et al    yielded similar results  to reduce stress  the medical staff tended to rely on active coping strategies  such as using security protocols  practicing social isolation measures  and seeking support from family and friends  but they did not find it necessary to discuss their emotions with a professional 
Huang L  et al 
  found that a sample of nurses working during the COVID  emergency presented greater emotional reactions and turned more to problem focused coping compared with university nursing students 
Emergency workers must have sufficient self efficacy in terms of their coping skills to be able to manage and cope with stress levels 
Self efficacy in coping appears to be an effective protective factor in relation to stress levels and maladaptive responses  Chesney et al   
Self efficacy to cope with traumatic events has been effective in reducing the risk of developing PTSD  Bosmans et al   The main objective of this study is to identify the coping strategies activated by healthcare and emergency workers to deal with stress factors related to the COVID  emergency that may be associated with the risk of developing vicarious or secondary trauma 
Few studies have considered both groups simultaneously when analyzing the strategies they have adopted to manage stress during the COVID  emergency 
Hence  in this study  we are interested in detecting the similarities and differences in the approaches they adopted to manage their stress during the acute phase of the current pandemic According to Walton et al 
  the main acute stress reactions of emergency workers to emergency medical situations are emotional  cognitive  physical  and social reactions 
Therefore  these factors were included in the questionnaire used in the present study 
Moreover  reactions linked to stress factors for difficulties due to ineffective decision making and dealing with stress were also considered  Chesney et al   
In addition  fears regarding contracting the virus and infecting their own families because of COVID  were specifically considered  Du et al    Huang J 
Z  et al    Ornell et al    Walton et al   Based on results found in the literature  the specific objectives of this study are as follows Participants were selected on a voluntary basis through a trasversal sampling in order to take a picture of the situation caused by the pandemic emergency 
We used an internet platform to conduct the study and approached the participants using social media  dedicated mailing lists  and forums 
Participants from all Italian regions completed the questionnaire online 
The sample consists of   participants  males   and   females  whose average age was   years  SD     min   – max  
Further    of the sample were married    were separated  and the remaining   were single 
We selected various professional figures who had directly worked in various sectors during the COVID  emergency and who could be divided into two main groups 
The first  the  Health Group  consists of   participants   who were healthcare workers    doctors     nurses     psychologists   and seven healthcare assistants  
Their average age was   years  SD     and their average years of active professional service was    SD    
The second  the  Emergency Group  consists of   participants     emergency workers     firefighters   and   Civil Protection staff   whose average age was   years  SD     and average years of service was    SD    
There was an age difference between the two groups  t     p   and the distribution of the gender variable differed between the two groups  with   males and   females in the Health Group and   males and   females in the Emergency Group  χ    p    
The study involved participants from the entire national territory  and their workplace could be divided as follows      and   were from North  Central  and South Italy  respectively 
Further    of the sample worked directly with COVID  patients and   worked in specific COVID  departments 
Among the healthcare workers    had worked in direct contact with COVID  patients  whereas among the emergency workers  only   had assisted these patients  χ    p    
In the present study  we included two variables  lack of necessary instructions and lack of PPE  in accordance with the findings in the literature on their impact on the stress reactions of healthcare and emergency workers during the COVID  pandemic 
Among the participants    and   of healthcare and emergency workers  respectively  did not have sufficient instructions to intervene  χ    p n s 
  and   and   of healthcare and emergency workers  respectively  lacked adequate PPE when working  χ    p n s 
 This study used an online questionnaire and was conducted during the lockdown period owing to the COVID  pandemic 
The questionnaire had three parts  one each to collect online informed consent and baseline sociodemographic information  and one with an online series of questionnaires  as described in the next section 
Participants  anonymity was maintained in collecting the data 
The institutional Ethics Committee approved all the procedures This instrument s   items enable verification of the presence of two symptoms of vicarious trauma  Intrusion and Arousal  and their relative frequency 
The STSS was built on the basis of the conceptualization expressed in the DSM   American Psychiatric Association    regarding the characteristic PTSD symptoms 
In detail  the Arousal items describe situations characterized by anxiety  confusion  physical and psychological complaints  and agitation 
Intrusion refers to the re experiencing of the traumatic event even if not directly suffered through internal images and memories 
Instructions for the STSS I indicated that respondents should specify how frequently an item was true for them in the previous   weeks 
The statements are evaluated on a  point scale     never      very often  that provides scores for Intrusion  example items   I thought about my work with victims when I didn t intend to   Reminders of my work with clients upset me  and Arousal  example items   I had trouble concentrating   I was easily annoyed   I expected something bad to happen   I felt jumpy 
The reliability coefficients of the instrument are   and   for Arousal and Intrusion  respectively This is a  item measure of perceived self efficacy for coping with challenges and threats 
This measure focuses on the changes in individuals  confidence in their ability to cope effectively  based on the self efficacy theory  Bandura    Chesney et al   
Participants were asked   When things aren t going well for you  or when you re having problems  how confident or certain are you that you can do the following  Then  they were asked to rate on an  point scale the extent to which they believed they could perform important behaviors for adaptive coping 
The instrument yields three subscale scores   problem focused coping   α      stop unpleasant emotions and thoughts   α     and  support   α    
Anchor points on the scale are    cannot do at all     moderately certain can do  and    certain can do We constructed an ad hoc  item questionnaire that included Yes No questions to detect stress factors identified by the literature  such as the availability of suitable equipment and the receipt of clear instructions during the COVID  coping experience 
In this study  we present the results related to two of these items   Instructions  which refers to having received the necessary instructions to intervene  and  Equipment  which refers to having PPE 
Predictions of these factors have also been made in other studies  Du et al    Walton et al   
In light of the relevance and specificity of the lack of clear information or instructions and adequate PPE in the management of COVID  in the Italian context  as well as the findings in other studies  we decided to focus attention on these two risk factors Our analysis of the literature revealed that in situations in which they have to cope with a pandemic  several factors may affect the stress of medical staff and emergency healthcare workers and that COVID  represents an independent specific stressor  Spoorthy   
These stress factors have been identified as frequently affecting healthcare and emergency workers in emergency situations and leading to physical  emotional  cognitive  decision making  relational  and organizational stress  Del Missier et al    Sbattella    Argentero and Setti    Fraccaroli and Balducci    Bellelli and Di Schiena    Du et al    Walton et al   
Focusing on the specificity of the COVID  epidemic  items have been constructed regarding the fears of contracting the infection and of infecting colleagues or family members  Walton et al    since COVID  represents a factor of independent stress  Spoorthy    that has great impact  Huang J 
Z  et al   
Consequently  we constructed the ESQ consisting of   items assessed on a  point Likert scale  with scores ranging from    not at all  to    very much  grouped into six scales 
The participants were asked to indicate how often they experienced certain emotions and thoughts while performing intervention and emergency activities during the COVID  pandemic The scales correspond to the factors identified and confirmed by factorial analysis through an analysis of the main components with orthogonal rotation of factors  varimax 
The number of factors to be extracted was initially verified through the unit s largest eigenvalue criterion and  subsequently  by the scree test 
The ESQ is based on six scales The ESQ demonstrated good internal consistency  α     overall and for each individual scale  Organizational–Relational Stress  α     Physical Stress  α     Inefficacy Decisional Stress  α     Emotional Stress  α     Cognitive stress  α     and COVID  Stress  α    First  we performed Pearson s correlation analyses to identify the associations between the variables for the two groups that we considered in this study 
Subsequently  we checked for significant differences between the two groups as their stress levels  coping strategies  and secondary trauma 
We used hierarchical linear regression models to verify the predictive effect of the risk factors  lack of adequate information and PPE  on the different stress levels  in step  
Then  we verified the protective effect of the coping strategies  in step  
The models were controlled for age  gender  and group 
Lastly  we used hierarchical regression models to verify the predictive effect of stress factors on the components of secondary trauma 
The models were controlled for age  gender  and group First  we conducted correlational analyses and comparisons of averages on the reference sample 
Table   shows the correlations between the scales of the ESQ and the other instruments Preliminary comparisons were made through the Student s t test between the Health Group and the Emergency Group in relation to the ESQ  CSES SF  and STSS I scores 
Table   shows the comparison between the two groups As shown in Table   significant differences emerged between the two groups in relation to their Stress and Arousal levels 
The results indicate higher levels of both for the Health Group  and that emergency workers turn more to the Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts strategy 
Further  we performed comparisons with reference to the gender variable to detect differences in the levels of stress factors  coping strategies  and secondary trauma 
Females reported significantly higher Physical Stress than males did  Females  M     SD     Males  M     SD     t     p     as well as Emotional Stress  Females  M     SD     Males  M     SD     t     p     and COVID  Stress  Females  M     SD     Males  M     SD     t     p    
No gender difference emerged in coping strategies and secondary trauma 
Within the Health Group  there were significant differences regarding Inefficacy Decisional Stress  F     p     Doctor M     SD     Psychologist M     SD     average difference     p     and COVID  Stress  F     p     Nurse M     SD     Doctor M     SD     difference     p    
Within the Emergency Group  there were no differences in levels of stress and secondary trauma or coping strategies 
Moreover  we found similar correlations between the two groups for the Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts strategy and the stress factors  whereas for the other two coping strategies  we found a different association  particularly for the Emergency Group 
However  the t test comparisons highlight differences only at the level of the Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts strategy 
Given the findings of the preliminary analyses  we considered it necessary to include the age  gender  and group variables to test the predictiveness of the coping strategies on the participants  stress levels To test the predictive effect of the coping strategies on various levels of stress  hierarchical regression was conducted 
Considering the Age and Gender differences within the groups  we included these variables in all models together with the Group variable  Health vs 
Emergency  and the  Instructions  and  Equipment  variables 
The models generated by assuming the ESQ scales as dependent variables are shown in Table  
Regarding the coping strategies  we observed an important effect of the Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts Coping strategy on all the stress scales  except for Physical Stress where the effect of the Focused Problem Coping strategy is recorded As shown in Table   significant negative associations between stressors and secondary trauma were found for both groups 
The hierarchical regression models of stress scales were analyzed for the Arousal and Intrusion levels of secondary trauma 
The models included the Age  Gender  Health Emergency Group variables  and the ESQ scales 
The results are shown in Table  The same regression models were generated by including coping strategies as predictors and were analyzed by Age  Gender  and Health Emergency Group 
Compared with Arousal  the Health Emergency Group and Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts are predictive  R    F     p     Beta  ∗∗∗  Beta  ∗  respectively 
Compared with Intrusion  only the Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts variable  R    F     p     Beta  ∗  assumes significance This study has several limitations 
The first is the limited sample size 
The second is that our study involved participants in the very midst of the COVID  emergency  which means that the level of stress in healthcare workers may have been more severe and acute 
Moreover  the long term psychological implications for the healthcare and emergency population should be investigated for the presence of a full secondary trauma 
Therefore  a large sized longitudinal study is called for to further explore the pathogenesis of vicarious traumatization 
The third is that participants were not selected based on whether they had existing psychological problems 
In proposing the hypothesis of this study  we anticipated that we would be able to discover the relationships between coping strategies  emergency related stress  and secondary trauma in healthcare and emergency workers and commenced our investigation by assuming that the impact of stress can provoke psychological consequences in emergency situations 
In future work  this assumption could be tested to verify whether an emergency situation has a different impact on workers who have already experienced psychological problems The raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors  without undue reservation  to any qualified researcher The studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by Comitato Etico per la Sperimentazione Umana – CESU of the University of Urbino

As reported by some  the association of acute kidney injury  AKI  and COVID  has a high mortality   
However  the incidence of reported AKI associated with COVID  varies widely             
It would be expected that kidney involvement is frequent since the virus enters the cell through the angiotensin converting enzyme    ACE  which is expressed  in addition to pulmonary type   alveolar cells  on renal proximal tubular cells  glomerular visceral and parietal epithelium  and the cytoplasm of the distal tubules and collecting ducts         
In addition  COVID  induces hemodynamic instability and severe inflammation  which  in addition to direct renal infection  can induce acute tubular necrosis  ATN 
We report our experience with AKI in COVID  patients in an inner city  predominantly minority  and a low socioeconomic group and compare our experience with other studies in significantly different cohorts of patients 
We identify the incidence  risk factors  and prognosis of AKI and thus provide a broader understanding of this complication in a group of patients not specifically reported upon to date All adult patients   years of age admitted to the Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center with COVID  infection from March   through April     were studied in this retrospective analysis done in a single medical center serving a low income minority population in Brooklyn  NY 
It was one of the single centers with the most admissions of COVID  patients 
COVID  infection was diagnosed based on clinical presentation  radiographic lung abnormalities  and a positive result of real time PCR 
We excluded COVID  patients from our study if they were on maintenance hemodialysis or were renal transplant recipients 
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Brookdale Hospital and did not require patient consent because of its retrospective design We collected the demographics  the presenting clinical symptoms when available  prior medical history including outpatient medications and prior level of renal function  comorbidities  and in hospital laboratory data from the electronic medical record  Epic Hyperspace   
Laboratory data consisted of complete blood count  hemostasis parameters  renal and liver function  PF ratio  arterial oxygen partial pressure  PaO  fractional inspired oxygen  FiO   creatinine kinase  lactate dehydrogenase  and inflammatory markers including high sensitivity C reactive protein  hs CRP  ferritin  and D dimer 
Normal range of these measures was provided by our laboratory The Kidney Disease  Improving Global Outcome  KDIGO    definition was used to identify AKI 
Estimated glomerular filtration rate  eGFR  on admission was taken as baseline eGFR and was divided into   and ≥  mL min  m 
eGFR was estimated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study  MDRD  equation 
The earliest day of the serum creatinine change that met the KDIGO criteria for AKI was selected as day   of AKI 
The peak serum creatinine value was used to determine the stage of AKI  with an increase in the serum creatinine of  –   –  and   times the baseline serum creatinine defined as AKI stages     and   respectively Continuous variables were described as mean   standard deviation for normally distributed data  or median and interquartile range  IQR  values for non normal distribution 
Categorical variables were presented as frequency and percentage 
The mean of continuous variables was compared by using independent t tests  the Wilcoxon rank sum test  and the Kruskal Wallis test  across the stages of AKI 
The proportion of categorical variables was compared by using χ  test 
Fischer s exact test was used when there were only limited data available 
The Kaplan Meier method  log rank test  was used to determine the cumulative incidence of in hospital mortality 
We used the Cox proportional hazard  PH  regression to determine the association of kidney disease indicators and in hospital mortality 
The assumptions of the Cox PH model were checked using the Schoenfeld residuals  and no violations of the assumptions were present 
In the multivariable analysis  separate Cox PH models were used to determine the association of baseline eGFR and blood urea nitrogen  BUN  on admission  proteinuria  hematuria  and stages of AKI with in hospital mortality since these variables showed a highly significant correlation 
Variables for Cox PH regression were selected using stepwise regression 
Variables with α level of risk factor   were entered into the model 
While evaluating the association of hematuria and proteinuria with in hospital mortality by the Cox PH model  patients with missing values  n     were excluded from the analysis 
All statistical analyses were performed using the STATA version   software and a p value of   was used to determine statistical significance In this study    adult confirmed cases of COVID  were initially reviewed 
Patients on maintenance hemodialysis  n     were excluded from the study and   patients were used for the analysis 
Baseline characteristics of these patients are shown in Table  
  of our cohort were African Americans and   were Hispanics 
The median age of the patients was   years  IQR  –  and   of them were male 
Most of these patients presented with dyspnea   cough   and fever  
  of the patients had a systolic blood pressure below   mm Hg at presentation 
   n     of all patients were mechanically ventilated during the hospitalization 
The median values of ferritin  D dimer  hs CRP  creatinine kinase and lactose dehydrogenase were elevated above their reference ranges  see online suppl

The development of AKI was seen earlier in the course in patients with an eGFR   mL min  m  at presentation   vs    and occurred within   h of admission 
Patients who developed AKI during the hospitalization were more likely to have a systolic blood pressure of   mm Hg at presentation and a lesser PF ratio and were more likely to be intubated during the course of hospitalization  Table  
Eighteen out of   patients with documented chronic kidney disease  CKD  prior to admission developed AKI during the hospitalization

Table  The number of patients requiring renal replacement therapy  RRT  during the hospitalization was  
This represented   of all patients and   of those with AKI 
All the patients who required RRT by definition had stage   AKI 
The modalities of RRT were continuous RRT in   patients   of all those who required RRT  and intermittent hemodialysis in   patients  
Two patients   required both modalities of RRT 
    out of   of those patients who required mechanical ventilation developed AKI compared with     out of   of nonventilated patients 
Of these   patients      required RRT 
The majority of AKI stage   patients requiring RRT were on mechanical ventilation   out of   requiring RRT

The in hospital mortality was significantly higher in patients with an eGFR   mL min  m    than in patients with an eGFR ≥  mL min  m    at presentation 
The in hospital mortality of AKI patients was     out of   who developed AKI died   Table  A significantly higher in hospital mortality was observed in patients with an eGFR   mL min  m  at presentation  elevated BUN at presentation  and in hospital AKI using the Kaplan Meier analysis  Fig

In a multivariable Cox PH model  adjusted for age  gender  PF ratio  hemodynamic status  and comorbidities  diabetes  HTN  hyperlipidemia  cancer  and stroke  eGFR   mL min  m  at presentation  BUN on admission  and AKI greater than or equal to stage   was associated with a higher risk of in hospital mortality 
There was no significant association between in hospital mortality and proteinuria and or hematuria  Table  AKI is common among hospitalized patients  incidence  –  and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality       
In our cohort of   COVID  patients  a relatively higher percentage of patients     of   developed in hospital AKI 
Current evidence suggests that AKI in COVID  patients is a result of an interplay of virus mediated injury  a dysregulated inflammatory response  angiotensin II pathway activation  hypercoagulation  and microangiopathy   
These COVID specific factors likely interact with the other known risk factors for AKI  such as hemodynamic instability  hypoxia  and sepsis  which increased over time 
The increase in the cumulative incidence of AKI over time in our cohort is likely associated with concomitant clinical deterioration and less likely represent a unique renal effect of COVID 
Compared to studies of AKI in COVID  patients from other countries  we found our incidence to be higher than that reported from   Asian countries  –  and is similar to that in an Italian study             
However  it is lower than that in the more recent report by Hirsch et al 
  who detailed their experience in   academic and community hospitals in metropolitan New York   none of which are located in the inner city  lower socioeconomic neighborhoods with a predominant minority population 
As compared with the above cited studies  the incidence of stage   AKI   was highest in our cohort 
It is not possible to determine with certainty the cause s  of this wide variation 
However  we did note a higher prevalence of comorbid conditions in our group 
For example  Cheng et al 
  reported a   incidence of AKI  with a   prevalence of HTN and a   prevalence of DM in their study population 
In our cohort  roughly twice as many   had HTN  and more than   times as many   were diabetic  Table  
Also  the incidence of severe lung involvement that required mechanical ventilation was lower   than ours    Table  
Mechanical ventilation per se has been reported to be strongly associated with AKI   
In our cohort  the incidence of AKI was also higher among those requiring mechanical ventilation  We identified various risk factors for AKI in our study  Tables    
Similar to previous reports  our patients with AKI were more likely to be male  have a history of HTN  and have severe respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation     
In our study  higher BMI increased the likelihood of developing severe AKI 
A low eGFR at presentation more than doubled the risk of developing AKI  p      Table  
Patients with lower eGFR had a significantly higher cumulative incidence of AKI than those with eGFR   mL min  m   p     Fig 
 
Thus  there was a synergistic effect of reduced baseline kidney function and subsequent AKI 
We did not find an association between diabetes and in hospital AKI The role of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors  ACEi  in COVID  is a subject of ongoing debate 
ACEi can increase the expression of ACE  the receptor used by SARS CoV  to enter target cells     
However  ACE  has been shown to be beneficial in acute respiratory distress syndrome when replaced     
This possible protective effect is attributed to the degradation of proinflammatory angiotensin II to angiotensin by ACE 
At present  it remains unclear if ACEi facilitate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus    SARS CoV  cellular entry and intracellular virus replication and whether ACEi improve acute respiratory distress syndrome outcomes 
In our cohort  the use of ACEi was significantly higher in patients with a lower admitting eGFR  Table   and in those who experienced AKI  Table  
We found a similar association between AKI and non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs  but not with angiotensin II receptor blockers  ARBs  in our cohort  Table  
Further studies are necessary to delineate the relationship between ACEi  angiotensin II receptor blockers  and COVID  outcomes Markers of acute inflammation  ferritin and CRP  muscle injury  creatinine kinase  myocardial injury  and D dimer levels were significantly higher in patients with a low eGFR at presentation  online suppl 
Table   and in those with AKI  online suppl 
Table   suggesting causality by a dysregulated immune inflammatory response  the so called  cytokine storm We found an extremely high incidence of mortality in our study cohort 
High presenting BUN and low eGFR   mL min  m  were significantly associated with increased mortality  Table  
AKI was significantly associated with increased mortality 
The mortality risk was highest in stage   AKI  HR   CI  –   Table  
Mortality was   in the AKI group and   in the non AKI group  p    
Mortality rose concurrently with the AKI stages      and   for stages     and   respectively  Table  
These rates were over   and  fold higher than those reported by Hirsch et al 
    AKI    in non AKI 
However  our cohort s high mortality is similar to the findings of John Hopkins University and the American Community Survey 
They reported a   and  fold higher COVID  infection and mortality rate in predominantly African American counties than in predominantly white counties   
Wadhera et al 
  also reported a death rate of   per   in Brooklyn  about   higher than that of Manhattan 
Moreover  in New York City  current age adjusted mortality is highest among African Americans and about   times that of whites   Our hospital provides medical services for an ethnic minority and a low income population in the most impoverished neighborhood in Brooklyn  where   of the residents live below the Federal Poverty Level as per a   report   
  of our patients identified themselves as African Americans 
In comparison  in the study by Hirsch et al 
     identified themselves as whites  and only   identified themselves as African Americans 
The high representation of ethnic minorities in our study population may have contributed to the increased mortality 
This association has been widely publicized and is likely the result of a complex interplay of multiple factors 
These include  but are not limited to  a high burden of comorbidities  genetics  the pernicious influence of adverse socioeconomic determinants of health  the absence of the privilege to work from home  and the ability to follow the recommended social distancing   In our cohort      of the   patients with AKI required RRT 
Nineteen out of these   patients   were mechanically ventilated 
Thus  almost all of the additional requirements for acute dialysis during the COVID  pandemic at our institution were in intensive care units 
Overall      out of   of mechanically ventilated patients required RRT 
Elevated ferritin was associated with an increased risk of all stages of AKI and the need for RRT  online suppl 
Table  
Among those who received RRT      died versus     in the stage   AKI group who did not undergo RRT  p      Table  
Thus  there was no statistically significant improvement in survival  and the mortality remained extremely high in both the RRT and non RRT groups 
These findings should prompt the early involvement of a palliative care team to define goals of care in patients with COVID  disease and stage   AKI In our experience  ultrafiltration was not well tolerated 
It often increased pressor requirements and did little to improve the ventilatory status 
We observed a high incidence of hypercoagulability and frequent clotting of the dialysis filters  lines  and catheters 
Thus  the patients required higher than the usual doses of heparin Our study has limitations 
Although     of the study population had a low eGFR on admission  only     had a documented history of CKD 
Data were collected retrospectively from medical records and often did not have information regarding prior renal function 
Patients also may have had an elevated creatinine on admission secondary to AKI suffered prior to hospitalization 
If so  we may have underestimated the true overall incidence of COVID associated AKI 
It is not possible to rectify this problem  given the data at our disposal Our study is a single center study  with the majority of the study population identifying themselves as African Americans or Hispanics 
This limits our study s general applicability but provides a unique insight into this population and broadens our understanding of COVID  disease 
Data were missing on many patients at different stages of the hospitalization since they were collected retrospectively 
Importantly  little data were available regarding urine output  a defining characteristic of AKI 
With this lack of information  we may have again underestimated the true incidence of AKI Nevertheless  even with the above limitations of our study  the high incidence of AKI and its negative impact upon survival is abundantly clear 
In response to the high incidence of AKI in our patients with COVID  we increased our capacity to deliver RRT 
These efforts included the purchase of additional machines and dialysis solutions  additional staff training  and engineering alterations to allow dialysis on the general medical floors 
Also  we increased our stockpiles of catheters  filters  and dialysis solutions for intermittent and continuous RRT 
We also plan to establish a peritoneal dialysis program to further strengthen our acute dialysis capacity In conclusion  our data report explicitly upon a high proportion of ethnic minority patients in an inner city  severely economically deprived neighborhood  previously not studied 
Our patients experienced a high incidence of AKI and an extremely high mortality  especially in AKI stage  
Unfortunately  RRT provided little survival benefit

  supervisor Dynamic changes in computed tomography manifestations of   patients
with novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan  ChinaDuring the first week of December   a few cases of pneumonia caused by a novel
coronavirus appeared in Wuhan  Hubei Province  China 
The patients had a history of
visiting the nearby Huanan seafood market  where wild animals were sold  With the spread of the disease  such cases have also been found in other
parts of China and abroad 
As of   July     cases have been confirmed
worldwide  including   deaths and   recoveries The novel coronavirus was originally named   novel coronavirus  nCoV  it was
recently officially renamed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus  
 SARS CoV  by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses 
The disease
caused by SARS CoV  has been named coronavirus disease    COVID  by the World
Health Organization 
Like SARS CoV  SARS CoV  likely originated in bats  however 
the intermediary animal host remains unclear 
The nearest neighbor of the  nCoV
isolates from China is a bat SARS like coronavirus  Bat SL CoVZC SARS CoV  carries a high risk of human to human transmission  and such transmission
has been reported in family clusters and among medical workers  The main route of transmission
is respiratory droplets and contact transmission  the virus may also be transmitted
through the conjunctiva and via aerosols  Current epidemiological surveys indicate that the latency period generally
ranges from   to   days  with a maximum of   days 
Affected patients present with
pneumonia like symptoms  including fever  fatigue  cough  expectoration 
pharyngalgia  anorexia  and myalgia 
Some patients also have gastrointestinal
symptoms  including diarrhea  nausea  vomiting  and abdominal pain 
In severe cases 
patients may rapidly develop acute respiratory distress syndrome  septic shock 
difficult to correct metabolic acidosis  and coagulation dysfunction Increasing numbers of studies are suggesting the high clinical value of imaging
examinations  especially high resolution computed tomography  HRCT  of the chest  in
patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia –  Typical CT imaging
manifestations include multiple patchy subsegmental or segmental ground glass
opacities  GGOs  and consolidation in the bilateral lungs  The imaging manifestations in patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia often
change rapidly  and many patients thus undergo repeated CT examinations 
Some
patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia gradually improve  whereas others develop
persistent hypoxemia or dyspnea and gradually worsen 
The changes in the patient s
condition are often closely related to the severity of the lung lesions 
Therefore 
observing the evolution of the lung lesions by chest CT is very important to assess
and predict the patient s outcome This study was to performed observe the changes in the chest HRCT manifestations of
  patients with pneumonia caused by SARS CoV  from the time of the initial
diagnosis 
To our knowledge  this is the largest population evaluated to date among
studies of the dynamic changes in imaging manifestations of novel coronavirus
pneumonia Consecutive patients were retrospectively enrolled in this single center study
from   January   to   February  
These patients met the Diagnosis and
Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia  trial version   issued by the National
Health Commission of the People s Republic of China  and their diagnoses were confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction 
According to the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus
Pneumonia  trial version   issued by the Chinese National Health Committee 
patients who developed severe pneumonia during their disease course were
excluded 
Severe pneumonia was defined as severe respiratory distress
 respiratory rate of   breaths minute  a requirement for oxygen treatment
or mechanical ventilation  an oxygen saturation of   on room air  a
partial arterial oxygen pressure fraction of inspired oxygen ratio of ≤  mmHg 
shock  or pneumonia combined with other organ failure All patients were examined using a Discovery CT  HD scanner  GE Healthcare 
Chicago  IL  USA  during a single inspiratory phase 
Before the examination  the
medical staff guided the patient to hold his or her breath and inhale 
After
complete exhalation  the patient held his or her breath  and a CT scan was
performed from the bottom of the lung to the apex of the lung 
The tube voltage
was   kVp with automatic tube current modulation 
The scan time was   s  the
scan interval was   mm  and the scan layer thickness was   mm 
After scanning 
adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction of   and the standard algorithm
were adopted  and the reconstruction layer thickness was   mm 
No contrast
agent was used during the CT scan 
Most patients underwent multiple chest CT
examinations  largely because the clinicians were still unclear about the
evolution tendencies of the lung lesions associated with COVID  pneumonia 
Additionally  some patients had symptoms such as hypoxemia or dyspnea due to
rapid disease progression 
Therefore  multiple chest CT examinations were
required to observe the progress or absorption of pneumonia The major CT manifestations were described using internationally standard
nomenclature defined by the Fleischner Society glossary  using terms such as
GGO  consolidation  and fibrous strips  A semi quantitative scoring system was used to estimate the pulmonary
involvement of all of these abnormalities on the basis of the area involved  Each of the five lung lobes was visually scored from   to   as follows 
  no involvement      involvement      to   involvement      to
  involvement      to   involvement  and     involvement 
The
total CT score was the sum of the individual lobar scores and ranged from    no
involvement  to    maximum involvement 
The number of affected lung lobes was
also recorded 
The images were transferred to an AW  workstation  GE
Healthcare  and anonymized 
All images were evaluated by two radiologists with
more than   years of work experience  and the final scores were determined by
consensus Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS Statistics for Windows  Version
   SPSS Inc  Chicago  IL  USA 
Measurement data are expressed as
mean   standard deviation  minimum–maximum  and categorical data are presented
as the percentage of the group 
A P value of   was defined as
statistically significant In total    CT scans of   patients   men    women  with confirmed COVID 
were collected 
The patients  ages ranged from   to   years  and their mean
age was       years 
Fever was the most common symptom  Table  
The patients
underwent        –  chest CT examinations  and the interval between the
first and last scan was       days  –  days The laboratory results are presented in Table  
Most laboratory results were
normal  with mildly elevated concentrations of C reactive protein
      mg L  D dimers       mg L  and ferritin      
µg L Based on clinical experience  five stages were identified from the onset of
initial symptoms  Stage A  –  days  n     Stage B  –  days  n     Stage
C  –  days  n     Stage D  –  days  n     and Stage E   days 
n    
One patient had a  day history of cough with fever and was in Stage B
at the time of admission 
The frequencies of different lesions in different
stages are presented in Table  
Two patients in Stage A and one patient in Stage E had no
lesions 
Multiple lobes were involved in most of the CT scans in all stages 
Multiple lobe involvement was present in     patients in Stage A   
  in Stage B      in Stage C      in Stage D  and    
in Stage E  GGOs could be seen in all stages  and the proportion of GGOs in each
stage was similar 
The proportion of consolidation first increased and then
decreased over time 
GGOs and consolidation were present in     and  
  patients in Stage A      and     in Stage B     
and     in Stage C      and     in Stage D  and    
and     in Stage E  respectively 
The consolidations in some cases were
absorbed As shown in Table  
the total CT score also first increased and then decreased over time  and the
total CT score of pulmonary involvement was significantly higher in Stage B than
in Stage A       vs        respectively  P    
Additionally  the
total CT score of lung involvement was significantly higher in Stage C than in
Stages B and D       vs         P     and       vs       
 P     respectively 
The number of involved lobes was significantly higher
in Stage B than in Stage A       vs        respectively  P    
Notably  the CT score of the lower lobe was significantly higher than the
corresponding upper and middle lobes in Stages A  B  C  and D  P     for
all 
In Stage E  the CT score of the right lower lobe was significantly higher
than that of the right upper middle lobes  P     and P    
respectively  whereas no significant difference was observed in the CT score
between the left lower lobe and left upper lobe The CT images of a patient with novel coronavirus pneumonia are shown in Figure  
GGOs and
consolidation first increased from Stage A to Stage C  after which the
consolidation gradually absorbed  the GGOs then gradually decreased in Stages D
and E Since the end of   an outbreak of a novel pneumonia in Wuhan has been drawing
tremendous attention around the world 
Chinese government officials and researchers
have taken swift measures to control the outbreak and conduct etiological studies 
The causative agent of this pneumonia has been identified as SARS CoV  a novel
coronavirus 
As its name suggests  its genetic structure is   similar to that of SARS CoV The most frequently affected organ of the novel coronavirus is the lung 
In the
previous version of the diagnosis and treatment guideline for pneumonia caused by
novel coronavirus  the diagnosis was confirmed by the presence of viral nucleic
acids in throat swabs  sputum  and alveolar lavage fluid 
However  the more recent
guideline indicates that if typical chest CT findings are observed in patients
suspected to have COVID  the patient should be clinically diagnosed 
This
reflects the important role of chest CT in the diagnosis 
Moreover  current clinical
experience is showing that the chest CT manifestations change rapidly 
Therefore 
many patients in the present study underwent multiple repeated examinations during
treatment 
To our knowledge  this study is by far the largest case series of
follow up imaging among patients with COVID SARS CoV  infects human respiratory epithelial cells through S protein and has a
strong infection capacity for humans 
Coronavirus particles have a diameter of   to
  nm and can directly reach the bottom of the lung 
Because of lung volume and
gravity  respiratory airflow  and other factors  the type II alveolar epithelial
cells present at the bottom of the lung become the target cells of the coronavirus 
Therefore  the lesions are mainly distributed under the pleura or along the vascular
bronchial bundle  After the alveolar epithelial cells have become combined with the virus  the
alveolar wall is damaged and large numbers of immune cells and lymphocytes
accumulate  resulting in swelling around the lung leaflets and blood vessel
congestion 
The pulmonary lobules merge with each other  forming nodular or patchy
GGOs 
As the disease progresses  multiple lung segments become involved  the scope
of the lesion expands  the alveolar wall shrinks and collapses  and the exfoliated
and necrotic epithelium and the exuded inflammatory cells form a hyaline membrane 
These changes manifest as coexisting imaging abnormalities such as GGOs  nodules 
consolidation  and fibrous cord strips Several studies have focused on the evolution of CT changes in patients with COVID 
pneumonia 
Pan et al  analyzed the disease course according to  day stages and found that the CT
score was the highest on days   to   of the disease course  after   days  the CT
score of the lower lung was significantly higher than that of the middle and upper
lungs 
Zhou et al  found that CT images of patients with COVID  pneumonia showed a
predominantly peripheral  middle  lower  and posterior distribution 
The early rapid
progressive stage was   to   days from symptom onset  the advanced stage with peak
levels of CT abnormalities occurred from   to   days  and the abnormalities started
to improve after   days 
Lei et al  reported that patients with COVID  pneumonia had a typical transition from
the early stage to the advanced stage and then from the advanced stage to the
dissipating stage 
Single or multiple GGOs were distributed along the
bronchovascular or subpleural regions in the pulmonary parenchyma in the early
stage  higher density consolidations were observed in the advanced stage  and the
GGOs and consolidations were absorbed in the dissipating stage 
Xiang et al  evaluated only six patients with COVID  pneumonia and reported that the CT
score peaked at   to   days and that the CT scores of the lower lobes were
significantly higher than those of the middle upper lobes after   days from disease
onset 
These findings were consistent with those reported by Pan et al  Liang et al  reported that the majority of patients had involvement of three or more
lobes 
Bilateral involvement was more prevalent than unilateral involvement 
The
proportions of patients observed to have pure GGOs or GGOs and consolidation
decreased over time  while the proportion of patients with GGOs and linear opacities
increased 
The total severity score showed an increasing trend in the first   weeks 
Bernheim et al  divided the disease course into three stages  –   –  and  –  days  and
found that   of patients in the first stage had normal CT findings 
As the time
since onset of symptoms increased  the CT abnormalities became more frequent  these
findings included consolidation  bilateral and peripheral disease  greater total
lung involvement  linear opacities  the  crazy paving  pattern  and the  reverse
halo  sign In this study  we evaluated the CT findings of   patients with COVID  pneumonia
confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction 
The patients underwent
a mean of        range   –  chest CT examinations 
At present  the course of
COVID  pneumonia and when patients should be re examined remain inconclusive 
As
mentioned above  different studies have staged the disease according to different
time periods 
We grouped the patients  CT scans at different time intervals 
The
time interval grouping was based on current clinical experience and is consistent
with the imaging interval described in the pneumonia diagnosis and treatment guidelines  This grouping is also partially similar to that described by Pan et al  and Zhou et al  Multiple lobe involvement was observed in most patients in all stages  and
lower lobe lesions were significantly more common than upper and middle lobe
lesions  this is also consistent with the findings reported by Pan et al  and Liang et al  As mentioned above  most studies have suggested that patients with COVID 
pneumonia undergo a typical transition from the early stage to the advanced stage
and then from the advanced stage to the dissipating stage  however  the time to
reach the peak of the disease course varies among different studies  and the
patients in our study showed a similar tendency 
GGOs and consolidation were the
common chest CT manifestations  the proportion of GGOs in each stage was similar 
while consolidation and the total CT score first increased and then decreased over
time 
The total CT score was significantly higher in Stage B than in Stage A  while
the total CT score was significantly higher in Stage C than in Stage B 
These
findings suggest that the lung lesions of most patients significantly improved after
  days and that most patients with new coronavirus pneumonia had a disease course
of more than   days This study had three main limitations 
First  we did not consider the effects of
factors such as age  sex  medical history  including hypertension  hyperlipidemia 
hyperglycemia  and malignant tumors  and lifestyle habits  including smoking and
drinking history  on patient outcomes 
Second  although   patients with novel
coronavirus pneumonia were included in this study  the number of patients in Stages
B to E was limited 
Future studies should include more patients and extend the
observation time to ensure that the study results are more representative 
Third 
some studies have suggested that factors such as age  the C reactive protein
concentration  and the interleukin  β concentration may be related to patient
outcomes 
However  we did not perform a correlation analysis between the laboratory
data and patient outcomes In conclusion  we followed up and evaluated   chest CT scans of   patients with
confirmed COVID  pneumonia and found that most patients had a disease course of
more than   days and that the lung lesions of most patients improved significantly
after   days 
The purpose of this study is to help clinicians better understand the
disease course and properly perform chest CT re examinations for patients with
COVID  pneumonia to minimize the radiation dose Transdermal Delivery Systems for BiomoleculesDrug delivery is related to many problems focused on the molecular stability  pharmacokinetic  and amphoteric nature of a substance 
Due to chemical instability and high degradation by enzymatic action regardless of the distance to the specific target organ  all of this is more complicated when the bioactive substance that is intended to be administered is a biomolecule  such as peptides and proteins   Currently  there is a system that is applied to the protein drug delivery  which is a non conventional system developed primarily for protein and peptide drug delivery 
This new delivery system has a higher efficiency that improves the passage of the protein drug to the skin   
The transdermal drug delivery  TDD  system reduces potential exposure to side effects in the host and improves protein stability by also reducing enzymatic degradation  which is very common to occur when a drug takes the most conventional routes to enter the body  such as oral and subcutaneous routes 
Mainly  TDD systems avoid the first pass of metabolism  which occurs in the liver   
The protein and peptide drugs are important in many innovative treatments  such as immunotherapy  where biomolecules  such as antibodies  growth factors  and interleukins  are used 
These are proteins with high susceptibility to degradation to many endogenous and exogenous factors  such as temperature and pH  and most importantly  enzymatic degradation and immune clearance One of the most important advantages of the transdermal route is to maintain drug release in a constant and prolonged release to achieve optimal blood circulation concentrations   
For transdermal protein drug delivery systems  specific methods or devices are used to allow or enhance intact passage through the stratum corneum  SC 
The most suitable systems for the release of biomolecules are the third generation transdermal delivery systems  whose effects are directed to the SC 
For TDD systems of biomolecules and vaccines  thermal ablation and microneedles are the most widely used physical penetration enhancers 
However  there are many other systems that have been tested for transdermal release of biomolecules   that have been included in the second and third generation of transdermal delivery systems  such as iontophoresis and electroporation This article highlights the main technologies used as tools that improve transdermal protein drug delivery systems  addressing them from the point of view of research in the development of transdermal systems where many technologies and devices have a high possibility of use in conventional drug treatments  such as nanotechnology devices 
The authors provide an overview of the various systems that exist in TDD that have been tested and proposed for the transdermal delivery of biomolecules The skin is a three layer laminate that is made up of the SC  the epidermis  and the dermis   
The epidermis is the outermost layer and is formed from the stratified epithelium  the stratum germinativum  spinosum  granulosum  lucidum  and corneum   Fig 
 The SC is the outermost and impermeable skin layer that prevents the entry of most chemicals   
This barrier is formed by around   to   lines of dead keratinocytes  corneocytes  that have united with each other with corneodesmosomes forming a wall embedded in a lipidic matrix 
The extracellular matrix is formed by lipids  such as fatty acids  ceramides  cholesterol  cholesterol sulfate  and sterol wax esters arranged in lamellae  and multiple lipid bilayers  although the matrix is primarily composed of ceramides     
Corneocytes contain involucrin  loricrin  and cornifin around their periphery and have a thickness of   μm  but this can be modified by factors such as hydration and the anatomic site of the skin   
This stratum contains high amounts of keratin inside the corneocytes  and the keratin filaments provide the hexagonal shape and stratum mechanical strength of the corneocyte   
In addition  the SC acts as a barrier  preventing desiccation and pathogen entry and protecting against ultraviolet rays 
The SC also plays an important role in wound repair The transdermal delivery route has been used many times for the local application of therapeutic substances  and it is a practice that is still used and that will continue to grow in the coming years The transdermal drug delivery systems also allow homogeneous absorption and have good pharmaceutical efficiency  reducing the adverse effects that drugs could cause in the host and reduce the drug risk to suffer alterations caused by enzymatic factors and the immune system present in the intrinsic environment 
Besides that  these systems are more comfortable for the patient   This method is formed by steps that start when the therapeutic molecule enters the skin until it enters the blood circulation 
The first step is penetration  which occurs when the drug is deposited onto the specific skin layer 
Later  the permeation step occurs when the molecule diffuses from one layer to another 
Finally  in the resorption process  the drug enters the bloodstream     This type of drug delivery system has advantages over traditional systems because it can allow the storage of small amounts of drugs in the transport and delivery structure  which are developed by nanotechnology using mainly polymeric nanomaterials made with biopolymers  microneedles  and nanoparticles With these devices  it is possible to improve drug delivery and its bioavailability 
Thus  it is possible to reduce the frequency between drug administrations 
The most innovative property is that the device is only replaced when the dose is finished and it can take several days     
The exact side effects that they could trigger are unknown  since they could mainly depend on the type of bioactive drug it contains  which could be related to some effects of the mechanical properties of the skin    Table  Peptides and proteins have long been important resources in the treatment of many diseases 
Many of the therapies that are applied for many diseases have recently used peptides and proteins  which is called biological therapy and focuses on the production of the main proteins obtained from living organisms such as transforming bacteria The main diseases which are treated with proteins are diabetes  hemophilia  infectious diseases  and anemia 
These therapeutic proteins are primarily hormones  interleukins  anticoagulants  and enzymes  which are recombinant proteins 
Other protein drugs  such as calcitonin  rituximab  gemtuzumab  insulin  epidermal growth factor  and interferons  are best known for their importance in the treatment of osteoporosis  lymphoma  leukemia  and diabetes mellitus   The most employed biological protein therapy is immunotherapy  which has several applications 
One of the most important applications is cancer treatment  which is a specific treatment that employs cytokines  a kind of protein produced by the immunity system that helps the patient s immune system eliminate cancer cells and prevents the replication of cancer cells 
These immune proteins are classified in therapeutic groups known as cytokines  monoclonal antibodies  tyrosine kinase inhibitor  and rapamycin receptor inhibitors in mammals  mTOR    
Two main kinds of cytokines are the most importantly used in biological therapies  interleukins and interferons 
Production is carried out with laboratory animals and once extracted and purified  they are used by injection into a human recipient for clinical treatment  e g  monoclonal antibodies 
However  there are many applications for products  such as antibodies obtained from live organisms and these are used mainly for the prevention of diseases such as in the development of vaccines 
The most important pharmaceutical products are listed in Table     Each one of these peptides or proteins has a different method of administration  such as intravenous  oral  topical  or intravesical 
Some other proposed methods of administration that would avoid the difficulties of the route of administration and offer comfort to the user include the nasal  pulmonary  ocular  and rectal routes    which could be as invasive as the traditional routes in many cases 
The main drawback of this type of therapies is that traditional administration such as subcutaneous injection and intravenous administration can modify their effectiveness  since the route of administration may vary in different clinical circumstances  for example  it may contribute to an increase in blood pressure   When any substance  including proteins  enters the bloodstream regardless of the route of administration  these proteins are exposed to many environmental threats such as sequestration by the reticuloendothelial system mainly for macrophage internalization  enzymatic degradation and absorption and elimination of serum proteins by the liver  –   which is an important factor to consider  since it represents a low efficiency in the application of biological therapy due to its high rate of degradation and elimination   
In addition to protecting the lability of all therapeutic proteins  it is also about preventing them from exerting their activity in places that do not require it 
Although immunotherapy is more effective and less toxic than therapies made with chemical molecules  these immune proteins also trigger adverse effects in the host  such as autoimmunities and non specific inflammatory processes   
For these reasons  research is being carried out on the use of alternative technologies with which these side effects can be controlled  such as with the use of nanotechnology using polymers  with which these proteins can be protected  favoring their transport and direct delivery to their objective  preventing them from exerting their toxic effect on non specific cells and sites   Nanocarriers  such as nanotubes    microneedles  MNs   –   fusion peptide carriers    or peptide conjugated nanoparticles  NPs      are some of the main carriers and protective systems used in immunotherapy  regardless of the size or structure of the molecule to be transported and protected  which could be genetic material  interferon  interleukins  or antibodies In   the US FDA approved the use of TDD systems and their use has been increasing in relevance for protein drugs because for some molecules these delivery systems improve the solubility of the compound  in addition to allowing it to pass efficiently through the skin There are important findings in research revealing that TDD technologies allow the loading  transport  and release of protein drugs 
They are very promising for the effective treatment of local cancers  with skin location  and they have a second benefit of activating the immune system from a remote distance 
Some of them have been developed to carry ribonucleic acid  RNA  that can regulate localized gene expression within a known target 
In other cases  it is possible to use an immunologic protein that could produce a strong adaptive immune response against a specific antigen in the case of vaccines  where it could be made with the tumor antigen expressed in the gene  tumor related protein or peptide  specific epitope  or cell lysate   For immunotherapy  it might be possible to employ monoclonal antibody loaded TDD systems and tumor agnostic therapies  non specific immunotherapies  use of interferons and interleukins  and cancer theranostic treatment where SC could be interrupted by a nanogel delivering a drug through the skin and allowing it to accumulate at the tumor site   or these systems may even function by delivering vaccine antigens  cancer vaccines  using nanoparticles and liposomes as antigenic carriers loaded on nanogels to pass the antigen through the SC by iontophoresis   
It is also possible to use microneedles loaded with Dermatophagoides farinae extract to achieve effective allergen release and effective immune response induction   These strategies have a wide range of application in various skin pathological circumstances  in addition to their main role in cancer therapy  and many products are used for the treatment of cancer 
Some of the commercial pharmaceutical products used for cancer therapy  which are administered transdermally  are described in Table     Through the use of transdermal delivery systems  it is sought to increase the solubility and stability  the circulating life  and the pharmacokinetic properties of drug proteins and peptides 
It is recommended to consider that the TDD system is not applicable to many of the biomolecules that are used as medical treatments since the success in the transdermal passage could depend on certain factors 
The efficacy of this therapeutic system depends both on the physical and chemical properties of the proteins and on the percutaneous administration systems of biomolecules to be used 
Regarding protein  the main physical properties to consider are the shape and size  molecular weight  solubility  and amphoteric nature  the latter being perhaps one of the most important to consider since due to its amphoteric property it can migrate in an electric field and its migration direction depends on the net charge that it has 
The knowledge of this property could help to elucidate which are the best percutaneous administration systems to facilitate passage through the SC 
In the case of charged proteins  physical  electrical  enhancers are the best option to use 
The chemical nature of proteins is another especially important factor to know 
This composition could help us to choose the best TDD system through which the protein will pass through the SC avoiding the reactivity of some functional groups of proteins 
For these reasons  there is little increase in the development of new therapeutic formulations administered by TDD systems  since there are some protein properties that need to be studied and analyzed to know if they can be administered by this route without affecting its stability and pharmacokinetic properties Peptides are molecules that have a molecular weight between   Da and   kDa 
This molecular weight depends on the molecular structures and their lengths with a small amount of amino acids or constitutes a protein with a complex structure 
These molecules are charged in a physiological pH and are hydrophilic  which complicates their permeability across the skin 
Some drugs have a lower or higher affinity with the lipophilic condition of the SC  which determines the quantity of the molecule that can cross this layer of the skin naturally 
Therefore  it is better to use a technique that improves passage to the skin  using or not natural permeation molecular routes avoiding the degradation of peptides or proteins and ensuring passage and integrity during the transport and release processes   There are important skin conditions that can change permeability  such as age  heat  racial differences  freezing  abrasion  chemical irritant activity  and some diseases such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis 
It is very important to recognize these for the development and use of devices employed in transdermal protein drug delivery In the skin  three molecular permeation routes are the most important  intracellular  intercellular  and follicular routes 
All of these are beneficiated by the concentration gradient of the molecules present in the milieu  allowing passive diffusion across the SC   
Moreover  physicochemical properties from the molecule affect its passage through the SC 
Hydrophobic molecules can cross the SC intercellularly  whereas hydrophilic molecules cross intracellularly by corneocytes 
Passage through the skin can take place through so called cutaneous defects  in which the skin has a discontinuity  such as sweat glands or hair shafts   In the skin  the SC and lipid layers have a barrier function  as both prevent the loss of water and avoid the entry of any substances  molecules  or microorganisms from the environment or microbiome 
These layers play a crucial role in the passive passage of proteins and other chemicals into the skin 
The liquid flux between the lipid layer depends on the lamellar and linear lipid matrix arrangement 
The lamellar layer is generally oriented parallel to the SC  and linear lipids are perpendicular to the SC 
If no long periodicity phase  LPP  exists  the permeability increases   
However  if the orthorhombic phase  OP  predominates  the permeability of the lipids is reduced  and if the OP predominates in the lateral layer  the permeation decreases   
The LPP is primarily formed by ceramides  cholesterol  and free fatty acids  and these have a unique tri layer organization  while an all trans chain lipid organization exists in the OP phase  which has a rectangular crystalline lattice and no mobility Transdermal drug delivery has been used for many years  and the skin was thought to be impervious to exogenous chemical molecules 
Currently  it is known that the skin is a semi permeable barrier  which allows its use as a transport route for molecules  allowing the molecule to reach the therapeutic target intact 
However  due to its anatomy  hydrophilic molecules can only pass through the skin if they are small  and even then  in many cases  they require help from an electric field  electrotherapies  as in the case of electroporation   and iontophoresis   
These techniques use a low voltage supplementation  direct current  around the drug site  allowing and enhancing passage through the skin   
When an electric field is applied to the skin  a large molecular movement occurs and the molecule can take the path of the hair follicle through the skin or induce pore formation     There is another technology using acoustic transmission  sonophoresis  that is used in medical trials  such as hyperthermia treatment  physical therapy  and ultrasonic surgery  which has the ability to facilitate drug transport to the skin   
Through this technique  mechanical waves of medium or low frequency are transferred to a physical medium  such as a specific gel  which allows it to propagate and transmit energy 
In the ultrasonic system  wave sounds have an oscillation frequency greater than   kHz   The TDD systems are an alternative route that allows the control of the drug release and decreases the possibility of any side effects associated with levels that are higher than the minimum pharmacological concentration  reducing pharmacological dosing times because a patch is administered every   to   h  This eliminates the risk of metabolism of the therapeutic agent and the loss of the available dose 
In addition  there are other advantages  such as the noninvasive drug delivery method  which can be discontinued at any time   
To facilitate TDD to improve SC permeation  some technologies improve drug flux of difficult drugs    such as cryioneumatic and photpneumatic technologies  sonphoresis  iontophoresis  electroporation  jet injection  and MN  which are used in the delivery of many drugs   The disadvantage in the above cases is that all devices require a low voltage supplement 
In addition  it is necessary to purchase equipment to manage the electrical current 
In addition  in some people it can cause sensitivity  such as tingling and irritation  and the technique can even cause blistering of the skin 
In these cases  when the technique is not well applied  it can cause burns to the skin 
In all circumstances  these techniques must be applied by trained personnel Despite these drawbacks  considerable research has been focused on the transport of peptides through the skin with good results 
In Table   we list some examples of these studies  the biomolecules and penetration enhancers  and the main result of each 
The table also indicates whether the physical penetration enhancer acts alone or is enhanced by a combination with another enhancer or nanocarrier    –  Many compounds have been employed to improve the penetration of substances across the skin  such as azone  pyrrolidones  alkanols  sulfoxides  glycols  alcohols  and surfactants   
Each of the chemical penetration enhancers has a specific action mechanism in the skin penetration process Due to the characteristics of the upper layer of the skin  which is specialized in avoiding and preventing the entry of any molecule or pathogen  the SC is complicated in terms of the passage of molecules greater than   Da  but it is not impossible 
In many cases  this process can be carried out using penetration enhancer molecules  which have good results in terms of penetration of molecules through the skin 
However  it represents a disadvantage because it could permit not only pathogens but also microorganisms in the cutaneous microbiota to enter as a consequence of cellular disruption integrity and the focal detachment of superficial corneocytes  such as in the use of thioglycolate in depilatory treatments   
The process of percutaneous absorption of a therapeutic molecule consists of several processes  which include the dissolution and release of the therapeutic agent  partition and diffusion within the SC  partition from the SC to the aqueous phase of the epidermis and its diffusion  and finally  access to the systemic circulation and target tissue There are three routes through which any molecule can breach this and reach the microcirculation through the tissue 
These are the intercellular  transcellular  and transappendageal routes  but the route can depend on the drug s molecular weight  Fig 
    Chemical penetration enhancers are a good alternative to allow the passage of biomolecules  but most of them cause skin irritation  which is uncomfortable for patients   
In many cases  the penetration enhancers have synergic activity when they are used in combination    but they can generate more skin irritation problems 
The mode of action of these enhancers is different for each one and depends on the mechanism by which it interacts with the compounds of the SC 
Due to this capacity  it has been classified according to their interaction ability in those that  a  interact with lipid heads within aqueous domains of the lipid bilayers and interact with the lipid alkyl chain   b  interact with actin filaments in the corneocytes   c  allow partitioning augmentation and increase drug protein solubility in the SC  and  d  improve penetration indirectly  modifying the drug  Fig 
    
Some of the most studied chemical penetration enhancers are the terpenes  amide  fatty acids  monoglycerides  and surfactants  and some of the most commonly studied are  D limonene  azone  lauric acid  monoolein and sodium lauryl sulfate   Depending on their chemical structure  some polymers can transport drug molecules within their structure  as in the case of cyclodextrins and their derivatives together with other saccharides  moieties  that can transport drugs as ketoprofen   or biomolecules such as levothyroxine sodium  T  which has been used as a topical treatment to eliminate lipid deposits in subcutaneous adipose tissue 
The main problem with this type of application has been the IT  detection in rabbits   h after the application of the cream 
The use of dimethyl cyclodextrin as a solubilizer for levothyroxine increased its solubility  but unfortunately  it only succeeded in penetrating much less levothyroxine through the skin than the required dose in humans   
In this way  it is important to highlight that the complex improves the solubility of the molecule allowing it to pass through the SC  and in another specific treatment  it could recognize a specific target in the cell plasma membrane and then adhere to it and release its content in a more efficient way Proteins are a substantial problem when we try to pass them through the skin 
First  they are larger  and second  they are highly susceptible to enzymatic degradation 
Not all are thermostable  and finally  another difficulty is that proteins and peptides live for a short time in plasma 
For this  it is necessary to protect them during their trip to the place of action 
Furthermore  this protection enables controlled delivery 
Passing through the skin can be less difficult if the protein is in a capsule  which is best when the capsule size is in the nanometric range Advances in the science of polymers applied in pharmacy have allowed the development of many encapsulation techniques that range from the most impractical to the most revolutionary methods 
However  this reveals a problem  as some polymers are not soluble in water and require organic solvents 
Furthermore  the integrity of the protein to be encapsulated is compromised regardless of the encapsulation technique Many types of polymers could be used in drug delivery  however  their chemical structure and molecular weight do not allow dissolution in water in many cases  and most dissolve well in organic solvents 
The solubility of the polymer is a characteristic that is important to determine before use because it can determine the environmental resistance in the process in which it will be used Biopolymers and their combinations are best used for these procedures  helping to improve the stability of the formulation as in the case of encapsulating transforming growth factor  TGF β  in poly d l lactic co glycolic acid   PLGA  and polyethylene glycol  PEG  polymeric microparticles for bone regeneration   
Insulin loaded PCL PEG PCL NPs are another example where the NPs were prepared by the w o w double emulsion solvent evaporation method and demonstrated satisfactory insulin delivery and efficacy in treating diabetic rats   
These NPs possess a specific protein drug delivery with a delivery degradation speed 
They are hydrophobic or hydrophilic according to what is necessary for the encapsulation procedure and for improvement in the stability of the protein drug 
They have a low or no chance of rejection and are safe to use Encapsulation processes are classified into two types  chemical and mechanical  which are then classified according to the methodology used to make the capsule 
This can be determined according to the desired size  shape  and composition surface chemistry 
The encapsulation of biomolecules by these methods allows us to avoid the degradation of the free protein and allows the prolonged and constant release of a protein drug in constant time     With these methods  it is possible to obtain nano sized particles  which are especially important to avoid their elimination by the immune system and the liver   
Smaller and softer particles can better evade the immune system  and this can be compatible with the recipient organism 
It is important to note that capsules with a diameter size of ≤  μm have the risk of being engulfed by phagocytic immune cells  therefore  the recommended NP size that could have an appropriate delivery range is   to   nm   Dendrimers are three dimensional NPs  like macromolecules  and are considered based on nanometric size 
These are radially symmetric and comprise an inner core structure made up of a central atom covalently bonded between other atoms 
The external composition is highly branched  forming a dendrimer structure 
These branches allow the formation of cavities into which bioactive molecules   can be incorporated  such as proteins   and peptides used for many pathological treatments   and for storage  transport  and controlled delivery There are many types of dendrimer structures  and depending on the synthesis method  these methods could use click chemistry   and divergent and convergent strategies 
In addition  there are different designs and chemical elements 
Their application in the administration of drugs has focused on the fact that these have many biocompatible characteristics 
These characteristics include non immunogenicity  non toxicity  and a high ability to cross biological barriers  such as cell membranes  blood vessels  intestines  and the blood brain barrier   In addition  they have high stability in blood circulation and a prolonged blood circulation half life  and they target specific structures 
These NPs can be manufactured in high purity and have some degree of in vitro toxicity when manufactured with cationic and anionic surface groups 
However  it is possible to reduce this toxicity by using surface protection by PEGs or fatty acids   In TDD systems  dendrimers have been employed for the penetration of nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs  such as indomethacin  which is an arthritis and osteoarthritis auxiliary drug in the treatment of the pain generated from this disease 
There is a study that reports the progress of the TAT PAMAM dendrimer system developed as a non viral vector for the transdermal release of DNA plasmids where the dendrimer system was modified 
The HIV transcriptional transactivator  TAT  was conjugated as a cell penetrating peptide to enhance the uptake of constructed plasmid DNA pIRES H GFP by cells   
Dendrimers are an excellent drug penetration enhancer   and they are some of the best nanostructures that have high applicability in medicine for the delivery of peptides and proteins As mentioned  traditional routes  intradermal  gastric  or intravenous  have long been the main delivery route for all drugs 
Nevertheless  the appearance of an increase in chronic diseases has allowed the development of new technologies that are less invasive and have high efficiency upon reaching the target  especially in cases in which a user must take more than one medicine for the treatment of one or more diseases at a time Although the design and use of MNs can ensure the entrance of molecules across the skin  biomolecules have a high degradation risk that can occur at any time  in the charging process or at the moment of release 
Thus  it is better to protect the protein contained within a specialized structure  such as nanocapsules or dendrimers  NPs in both cases 
This procedure has no danger for the protein or peptide structural composition  which improves the conservation and passage of these compositions across the SC  Fig 
 The PLGA NPs can go through SC better with the help of MNs because the micro conduits created by these needles allow the NPs to avoid the SC barrier and arrive at other skin layers and deliver the complete contents  Fig 
    
For this procedure  it is necessary to consider that  in all cases  the penetration capacity of NPs depends on the particle and channel size   
Despite this important consideration  among others  the procedure also avoids the limitations of the skin s physicochemical properties that do not permit crossing it Some experimental studies have demonstrated the penetration and distribution of PLGA NPs in MNs   
The most common use of NPs MNs is for experimental insulin release systems using murine models in rats with induced diabetes  where the insulin is introduced into H O responsive mesoporous silica NPs  and MN patches are manufactured for later transdermal application 
Its release behavior analysis demonstrated effective release   
For immunity induction  an excellent response occurs when the NPs MNs were employed 
For example  for the induction of immunity against endogenous prostate cancer stem cell antigen RALA pPSCA  the immunization via the NP MN release system resulted in anti tumor activity in both cases of prophylactic and treatment assays in vivo   
Another experimental process that allows probing the system efficacy is the use of poly methylmethacrylate  coated with   nm of gold NPs  which has great potential in tumoral cell destruction   Currently  there are few authorized devices  however  these are increasing because for many treatments  such devices are more appropriately used  effective  and exhibit more recommended results 
Perhaps shortly  these devices will be the most appropriate techniques for drug and protein delivery systems For many decades  a great number of therapies to resolve the problems associated with drug release have been implicated to probe numerous kinds of devices and pharmaceutical innovations to solve many diseases or applications in various clinical trials for the diagnosis of diseases or treatments of diseases 
For this application  it is necessary to design new technologies  and pharmaceutical chemistry has been concerned with offering the best administration methods for therapeutic agents Lately  many research studies have reported numerous results that indicate the most appropriate technologies to use in each case of a drug delivery system 
Each of the aforementioned TDD systems has some advantages and disadvantages for use in administering protein drug delivery However  these technologies create substantial and important opportunities for administering biomolecules 
In the coming years  we will observe an increase in their design  development  characterization  and clinical trials for the treatment of many important and chronic diseases SARS CoV  recruits a haem metabolite to evade antibody immunityDNA fragments encoding SARS CoV  S   Uniprot ID  P DTC  residues  –  NTD  –  RBD  –  SARS CoV  S   Uniprot ID  P  residues  –  HCoV NL   Uniprot ID  Q Q S  residues  –  HCoV OC   isolate LRTI  NCBI accession code KX  residues  –  were codon optimised for expression in human cells and cloned into pQ C xStrep vector   under control of the cytomegalovirus  CMV  promoter for production of the recombinant proteins carrying a C terminal extension containing human rhinovirus    C protease recognition site followed by a TwinStrep tag

The model was then docked into the cryo EM map of asymmetric  RBD up reconstruction and one RBD refitted to the extended position in Chimera  the model was manually adjusted in Coot and refined using phenix real space refine 
For the spike Fab model   RBD down spike model was fitted to the map using Chimera  the RBD of chain A was fitted in to the extended position  which is less well defined  and the NTD of chain C was extensively remodelled 
The protein data bank was searched for similar structures using the sequence of the Fab chains   APC   and  PHB   were selected as templates for the heavy and light chains of the Fab respectively  variable and constant sub domains were fitted individually using either phenix dock in map   and or fitted in Chimera 
The Fab fragments were manually adjusted to match the sequence of P  antibody and fitted to the cryo EM map 
The constant domains of the Fab are less well resolved in the map and minimal adjustments were made to these domains 
The whole structure was subjected to automatic flexible fitting using Namdinator v    and then phenix real space refine before another round of manual rebuilding in Coot and a final round of phenix real space refine

The initial molecular replacement solution was subjected to morph model in Phenix before commencing with rounds of manual fitting in Coot   and refinement using phenix refine  version  rc –   
First  the protein chain was fitted and extended where possible  and refined  then glycosylation moieties were added where visualized in the positive Fo Fc density  followed by conceivable PEG and water molecules 
The electron density around the disulphide bonds suggested that they were labile and as such were modeled as alternative conformations between oxidized and reduced where appropriate and the occupancy refined between these states 
The stability of the disulphide bonds could have been affected by trace amounts of DTT introduced during the treatment of the protein with  C protease and EndoH 
The Rfree and Rwork were   and   respectively  before a biliverdin molecule was fitted into the prominent positive difference density 
The final refinement included four Translation Libration Screw groups  residues  –   –   –   –  that had been segmented by the TLSMD server

Measurements were performed in duplicate The importance of feedback for surgical teams during the COVID  pandemic
Editor
As new research has emerged about COVID  transmission  personal protective equipment  PPE  and patient management guidelines have evolved 
This has led to rapid guideline changes within healthcare systems 
Conflicting guidelines can contribute to miscommunication  increased stress  and reduced cohesion among surgical teams 
To successfully implement new guidelines during times of crisis  specific and timely feedback can be used to identify and resolve breaches in infection control  and promote feelings of support among healthcare workers Although inherently less complex than live surgery  feedback in stressful simulated scenarios can provide information about common pitfalls and provide a safe environment in which to practice new skills 
Our group found that when under stress  mental practice coaching combined with feedback significantly enhanced performance compared to simulation alone by better preparing individuals to execute action 
Feedback and mental rehearsal can help improve individuals  knowledge of guidelines and confidence in their abilities to perform under stress 
Critical skills to master in this new environment include PPE donning and doffing  performing procedures on COVID positive patients while in PPE  and new workflow protocols Within normal workflow  new technical skills and adherence to new operative safety protocols may be improved by video based feedback 
In a randomized study  coached trainees using video feedback made approximately half the number of technical errors when compared with those receiving conventional training 
This coaching has been extremely well received when implemented in multidisciplinary teams 
Non technical performance can also be improved through structured curricula combined with debriefing and feedback Under the best of circumstances  it can be challenging to provide the feedback necessary to maintain and improve individual and team performance 
Our team developed the operating room  OR  Black Box®  Surgical Safety Technologies  Inc    a technology that continuously captures and synchronizes multiple sources of intraoperative video and audio data 
Postoperatively  analysts identify safety threats and resilience supports that may respectively contribute to  or help to avoid adverse events  so targeted interventions can be implemented to promote patient safety 
Over the last ten years  our group has researched effective ways to reduce surgical error and optimize surgical safety using feedback – To address the need for feedback during the COVID pandemic at our institution  we developed the COVID Black Box 
Data from simulation scenarios on COVID positive patients recorded via the COVID Black Box is assessed to detect breaches in infection control practices  and identify suboptimal performance for improvement 
Specific and timely feedback is provided to equip OR personnel on how to correct misinformation  improve responses  and facilitate behavioural change on an operative team level 
Although formal analysis has yet to be conducted  qualitative downstream effects of feedback observed include an increased sense of control  reduced stress  improved team communication  feelings of managerial support  and more positive attitudes indicative of the organizational safety culture During this global pandemic  hospitals and surgical departments should not underestimate the importance of providing their teams with feedback 
Hospitals without comprehensive recording capabilities should establish systematic methods of providing feedback to OR teams such as video recording operations or assigning dedicated observers to record breaches in safety practices 
This feedback should be presented to surgical teams immediately and continuously  and collated for the larger institution on a regular basis to transparently communicate lessons learned from previous surgical cases 
Specific and timely feedback may reduce preventable errors in surgery during the pressures of the pandemic 
With ongoing effort to support our surgical teams and better performance  we can help our front line OR staff and patients during both the first  and subsequent waves of this pandemic The Global COVID‐  Observatory and Resource Center for Childhood Cancer  A response for the pediatric oncology community by SIOP and St  Jude GlobalAfter rapidly spreading across the globe  COVID‐  officially became a pandemic on March    
 
 Initial reports suggested that patients with comorbidities were at higher risk  causing concern that children with cancer were at risk of developing severe infection 
 
 Furthermore  measures to mitigate the spread of the virus  such as delaying medical procedures and travel restrictions  were anticipated to disturb the continuity of pediatric cancer care 
 
 It was also anticipated that the effects of the pandemic on health systems would amplify existing obstacles to caring for children with cancer 
 

Since the beginning of the pandemic  a deluge of information regarding disease characteristics and possible management strategies was disseminated 
This infodemic  an overabundance of information during an epidemic 
 
 has posed challenges never encountered before and was an early concern 
 
 The rapid spread of information and misinformation  potentiated by social media platforms  presented a public health challenge  confusing and overwhelming healthcare professionals and lay public alike In response to the need for a trusted resource with curated  reliable information and a platform to share experiences for the pediatric oncology community  the International Society of Pediatric Oncology  SIOP  and St  Jude Children s Research Hospital  SJCRH  created the Global COVID‐  Observatory and Resource Center for Childhood Cancer  GCORCCC 
The GCORCCC was launched as an open‐access website  covid childhoodcancer org  on April    The Resource Library contains updated curated peer‐reviewed manuscripts  guidance documents  and links relevant to the multidisciplinary care of children with cancer during COVID‐ 
 
 Publications are reviewed and assessed for relevance weekly for inclusion 
 
 We prioritize the dissemination of accurate data and quickly identify and address misinformation or conflicting reports 
Only peer‐reviewed articles are included  as unvetted scientific information  such as preprints  were identified as a risk for misinformation for providers 
 
  
 

The sections of the Resource Library are as follows  COVID‐  and Pediatric Oncology  General COVID‐  Information  Treatment  Prevention  For Healthcare Providers  and For Patients and Families 
Each section provides a collection of publications  guidance documents  recorded webinars  and relevant links To address the needs of healthcare professionals during this unprecedented time  resources focusing on leadership  self‐care  and resiliency are also included in the Resource Library 
Additionally  a subsection specifically aimed at nurses  with literature and guidance documents  was developed 
The Pediatric Oncology Nursing during COVID‐  Fact Sheet summarizes the most relevant guidance for caring for children with cancer and is available in six languages as a quick bedside reference 
Finally  a section with resources for patients and families aids bedside providers in educating and navigating patients and families toward trusted  accurate sources of information At the beginning of the pandemic  the natural history of COVID‐  in children and adolescents with cancer was unknown 
To gain an accurate picture of the burden of COVID‐  among this patient population  we developed the Global COVID‐  Registry 
Healthcare providers worldwide were invited to voluntarily report any patient  under   years of age  with a malignancy or history of hematopoietic stem cell transplant at the time of a laboratory‐confirmed SARS‐CoV‐  infection 
The Registry was approved by the SJCRH Institutional Review Board As of December      cases from   countries have been reported 
Using aggregate data  we created an interactive data visualization dashboard to provide updates in a dynamic format  Figure  
The data visualization allows providers to filter cases by variables such as underlying diagnosis  cancer treatment  and COVID‐  outcomes Creating an opportunity to bring the global community of healthcare professionals together is an essential component of the GCORCCC 
The Collaboration Space provides a forum for healthcare professionals to interact and share their experiences and questions about caring for children with cancer during the COVID‐  pandemic 
The Collaboration Space has language translation capabilities  making it accessible to a large number of providers globally 
Here  users are also able to access content  such as videos  blog posts  and live events Through sharing experiences  providers can support and learn from each other 
From the Frontlines is a blog series published to highlight unique accounts of childhood cancer providers navigating COVID‐  around the world 
To date  the blog features stories from   providers in   countries 
These providers discuss the challenges their teams have faced and innovative solutions they have employed to continue to treat children with cancer during the pandemic 
Currently  there are   total active users registered in the Collaboration Space who have connected and interacted over   times with content elements A rapidly evolving pandemic poses many challenges in caring for children with cancer 
The GCORCCC established a mechanism to generate and transfer knowledge for the pediatric oncology community during a global pandemic and infodemic 
Through its various elements  users can access relevant information to help them adapt and respond to the rapidly shifting situation Academic institutions and professional societies should play central roles in the accurate and timely dissemination of information 
For professionals caring for children with cancer  the sharing of experiences from regions that were affected early in the pandemic was essential for formulating the initial responses to the evolving pandemic 
 
  
 
  
 
In addition  guidance for the management of COVID‐  for different patient populations was generated by government agencies and professional societies with remarkable speed 
 
  
 
  
 
Importantly  information sufficiency has been linked to less stress and worry amongst health care professionals 
 
 For this reason  a resource like the GCORCCC can support individuals to decrease burn out and improve resilience 
This effort brought colleagues together and facilitated a sense of community in these trying times  in an innovative approach to addressing global challenges in pediatric cancer care 
Many organizations attempted to compile listing of resources that are relevant to their specific populations  but few of them also sought to create knowledge about COVID‐  in their populations to add to the evidence‐based literature At a time of exceptionally high stakes for children with cancer  the multi‐stakeholder collaboration that led to the GCORCCC represents a framework for global cooperative efforts in the future 
SIOP and SJCRH formed a partnership aimed at disseminating the GCORCCC widely and rapidly throughout the global network  leveraging the strengths of both organizations 
This platform shows that novel  dynamic information resources can help provide guidance to frontline providers across the globe  facilitating the rapid sharing and adoption of new information in highly dynamic situations 
The collaborations built through this rapid multidisciplinary implementation and global dissemination process provide a foundation upon which the global community can collectively build to ultimately improve outcomes for all children with cancer everywhere In memoriam  This manuscript is dedicated to Dr  Arturo Moreno  past president of SLAOP SIOP Latin America  a tireless advocate for children with cancer in Mexico  Latin America  and the world The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest The Psychodynamic Approach During COVID  Emotional CrisisThe health emergency we are experiencing due to COVID  has strongly influenced not only physical health but also the mental health of the general population as well as collective behavior  Gray et al    Orrù et al   b  Lenzo et al   
The understanding of mental health consequences must consider individual emotional responses associated with the ongoing stressful experience of the COVID  pandemic  Di Giuseppe et al   a  Venuleo et al   
Negative emotions such as fear  anger  frustration and significant economic worries are associated with higher levels of anxiety  depression  sleep disturbances  maladaptive behaviors  and psychosomatic symptoms  Conversano et al   b  Franceschini et al    Parola et al   
As expected  the severity of clinical conditions is observed to be higher in vulnerable groups such as children  the elderly  psychiatric patients  and front line workers  Aafjes van Doorn et al   b  Elbay et al    Elkholy et al    Merlo et al    Shen et al    Singh et al    Orrù et al   
Research has demonstrated that emotion regulation plays a key role in stress management and adaptation helping the individual to cope with discharged feelings and thoughts related to the COVID  crisis  communication of the final stage of the individual s life  Iasevoli et al    and  therefore  protecting them from developing clinical levels of psychological distress  Di Giuseppe et al   e  Prout et al    Walker and McCabe   
The role of dynamic psychotherapy is essential in moderating people s emotional reactions  although its implementation requires the adjustment of therapeutic strategies enhancing adaptation and resilience  Aafjes van Doorn et al   a  Békés et al   
From this perspective  it is imperative to improve public awareness and establish adequate procedures and prompt responses of intervention Due to uncertainty surrounding COVID  collective distress and individual suffering  the psychodynamic approach may be able to consistently identify and manage stressful life event dynamics  Afari et al    Di Giuseppe et al   a  as well as fostering emotional regulation in order to prevent possible relevant factors involved in the pathogenesis of both psychological and psychosomatic syndromes  Lenzo et al    Martino et al   a b  Conversano and Di Giuseppe    Sardella et al   
This is of particular relevance at present with many experiencing grief and sorrow for the loss of a family member  a reduction of freedom  changes in daily routines and fears associated with uncertainty and the intolerance of uncertainty  Conversano et al   a  Orrù et al   a 
In response to these stressors  the individual activates unconscious defense mechanisms  psychological strategies that help in reducing the anxiety associated with the awareness of internal conflicts and externally charged situations  Perry    American Psychiatric Association   
Since defense mechanisms are hierarchically organized and own specific psychological functions  they may cause a wide number of negative consequences as well as playing a significant role as protective factors against psychological distress and psychopathological symptoms caused by the COVID  outbreak  Marazziti et al   
The use of high adaptive defense mechanisms promotes increased awareness of one owns feelings related to difficult life experiences and leads to better adjustment and resilience  whereas the use of immature defenses protects the self from painful feelings and thoughts at the cost of developing maladaptive affective  cognitive and relational disfunctions  Di Giuseppe et al    Perry et al   
Recent studies demonstrate that specific therapeutic intervention may increase the overall defensive maturity and improve psychological well being and adjustment  Hoffman et al    Prout et al   b    Di Giuseppe et al   d In this opinion article the relevance of the implementing psychodynamic approach in the prevention of individuals  mental health during the ongoing COVID  crisis has been highlighted 
In accordance with Marčinko et al 
  the inclusion of psychodynamic interventions within the public mental health emergency system is recommended  considered as an effective strategy in reinforcing the individual s well being both during and after the COVID  pandemic crisis 
The application of specific therapeutic interventions derived from the psychodynamic approach can enhance emotion regulation and adaptive responses as the COVID  pandemic progresses Understanding how the ongoing pandemic is influencing human reactions to such a stressful event is essential for developing ad hoc effective interventions 
The systematic assessment of unconscious psychological aspects of personality should be promoted for the early detection of vulnerable individuals and for improving research and clinical practice toward a personalized therapeutic approach  Lingiardi and McWilliams    Lingiardi et al    Tanzilli et al    Barber and Solomonov    Talia et al    Di Giuseppe et al   c  Zilcha Mano and Ramseyer   The author confirms being the sole contributor to this work and approves it for publication The author declares that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest Recombination Every Day  Abundant Recombination in a Virus during a Single Multi Cellular Host InfectionAs increasing numbers of full length viral sequences become available  recombinant or mosaic viruses are being recognized more frequently   
Recombination events have been demonstrated to be associated with viruses expanding their host range   or increasing their virulence    thus accompanying  or perhaps even being at the origin of  major changes during virus adaptation 
It remains unclear  however  whether recombination events represent a highly frequent and significant phenomenon in the everyday life of these viruses Viruses can exchange genetic material when at least two different viral genomes co infect the same host cell 
Progeny can then become hybrid through different mechanisms  such as reassortment of segments when the parental genomes are fragmented    intra molecular recombination when polymerases switch templates  in RNA viruses     or homologous or non homologous recombination  in both RNA and DNA viruses 
Quantification of viral recombination in multi cellular organisms has been attempted under two distinct experimental approaches  in vitro  in cell cultures     and in vivo  in live hosts    
The in vitro approach  which has so far been applied only to animal viruses  allows the establishment of the  intrinsic  recombination rate in experimentally co infected cells in cell cultures   
However  it does not necessarily reflect the situation in entire  living hosts  where the frequency of co infected cells is poorly known and depends on many factors such as the size of the pathogen population  the relative frequency and distribution of the different variants  and host defense mechanisms preventing secondary infection of cells 
The in vivo experimental approach is closer to biological conditions and may thus be more informative of what actually happens in  the real world However  as discussed below  numerous experimental constraints have so far precluded an actual quantification of the baseline rate of recombination 
First  many experimental designs have used extreme positive selection  where only recombinant genomes were viable  e g    
Other studies did not use complementation techniques but detected recombinants by PCR within infected hosts or tissues    which provides information on their presence but not on their frequency in the viral population 
So far  no quantitative PCR or other quantitative method has been applied to evaluate the number of recombinants appearing in an experimentally infected live host 
Finally  recent methods based on sequence analysis inferred the population recombination rate  rather than the individual recombination rate   
While results from these methods certainly take in vivo recombination into account  there are other caveats  isolates have often been collected in different hosts sometimes in different geographical regions and sometimes the selective neutrality of sequence variation on which these estimates are based is not clearly established 
Estimates from such studies by essence address the estimation of the recombination rate at a different evolutionary scale Taken together  the currently available information indicates that no viral recombination rate has ever been estimated directly at time and space scales corresponding to a single multi cellular host infection  although this level is most significant for the biology and evolution of viruses 
This study intends to fill this gap by evaluating the recombination frequency of the cauliflower mosaic virus  CaMV  during a single passage in one of its host plants  the turnip Brassica rapa CaMV is a pararetrovirus  which is a major grouping containing hepadnaviruses  e g  hepatitis B virus  badnaviruses  e g  banana streak virus  and caulimoviruses  e g  CaMV 
Pararetroviruses are characterized by a non segmented double stranded DNA genome 
After entering the host cell nucleus  the viral DNA accumulates as a minichromosome   whose transcription is ensured by the host RNA polymerase II   
The CaMV genome consists in approximately   bp and encodes six viral gene products that have been detected in planta  Figure     
Viral proteins P  to P  are expressed from two major transcripts  namely a  S RNA  encoding P  and a  S RNA corresponding to the entire genome and serving as mRNA for proteins P –P    
Using the pre genomic  S RNA as a matrix  the protein P   product of gene V  reverse transcribes the genome into genomic DNA that is concomitantly encapsidated   The detection of CaMV recombinants in turnip hosts has been reported numerous times 
Some studies have demonstrated the appearance of infectious recombinant viral genomes after inoculation  i  of a host plant with two infectious or non infectious parental clones   or  ii  of a transgenic plant containing one CaMV transgene with a CaMV genome missing the corresponding genomic region   
While the former revealed inter genomic viral recombination  the latter demonstrated that CaMV can also recombine with transgenes within the host s genome 
Another study based on phylogenetic analyses of various CaMV strains has clearly suggested different origins for different genomic regions and  hence  multiple recombination events during the evolution of this virus   
Indirect experimental evidence has indicated that  in some cases  CaMV recombination could occur within the host nucleus  between different viral minichromosomes  presumably through the action of the DNA repair cellular machinery   
Nevertheless  the mechanism of  template switching  during reverse transcription  predominant in all retroviruses  most certainly also applies to pararetroviruses 
For this reason  and on the basis of numerous experimental data  CaMV is generally believed to recombine mostly in the cytoplasm of the host cell  by  legal  template switching between two pre genomic RNA molecules    or  illegal  template switching between the  S and the  S RNA   
Under this hypothesis  recombination in CaMV could therefore be considered as operating on a linear template during reverse transcription  with the  ′ and  ′ extremities later ligated to circularize the genomic DNA  position   in Figure  
The above cited studies clearly demonstrate that CaMV is able to recombine 
However  since these studies are based on complementation techniques  non quantitative detection  or phylogenetically based inferences of recombination  they do not inform us on whether recombination is an exceptional event or an  everyday  process shaping the genetic composition of CaMV populations In the present work  we aimed at answering this question 
To this end  we have constructed a CaMV genome with four genetic markers  demonstrated to be neutral in competition experiments 
By co inoculating host plants with equal amounts of wild type and marker containing CaMV particles  we have generated mixed populations in which impressive proportions of recombinants distributed in several different classes corresponding to exchange of different genomic regions have been detected and quantified 
Altogether  the recombinant genomes averaged over   of the population 
Further analysis of these data  assuming a number of viral replications during the infection period ranging from five to   indicates that the per nucleotide per replication cycle recombination rate of CaMV is of the same order of magnitude  i e  on the order of a few   across the entire genome 
We thereby provide the first quantification  to our knowledge  of the recombination rate in a virus population during a single passage in a single host From Figure   and supposing that all marker containing genomic regions can recombine  we could predict the detection and quantification of seven classes of recombinant genotypes   bcd a  a cd b  ab d c  abc d   cd ab  a d bc  and a c b d 
Indeed  all classes were detected  and their frequencies in the ten CaMV populations analyzed are summarized in Table  Altogether  the proportion of recombinant genomes found in the mixed viral populations was astonishingly high and very similar in the ten co infected plants analyzed  Table   last column  ranging between    plant   to    plants     and   with a mean frequency   standard error  of      
This result indicates that recombination events are very frequent during the invasion of the host plant by CaMV and represents  to our knowledge  the first direct quantification of viral recombination during the infection of a live multi cellular host The inferred per generation recombination and interference rates  assuming that CaMV undergoes ten replication cycles during the   d between infection and sampling  are given for each of the ten plants in Table  
Recombination rates between adjacent markers are large  on the order of   to  
Taking the distance in nucleotides between markers into account yields an average recombination rate per nucleotide and generation on the order of      
Interestingly  this recombination rate does not vary throughout the genome  Kruskal–Wallis test  p    To relax the assumption of the number of replications during the   d  we calculated the recombination parameters assuming five or   generations 
The effect of the number of generations on the estimates is linear  doubling the number of generations results in a halving of the recombination rate  detailed results not shown 
For example  the average recombination rates r
  r
  and r
  assuming   generations were equal to     and   respectively  compare with values in Table   yielding per nucleotide per generation recombination rates of             and      Inspection of Table   also shows that first order interference coefficients were in general negative  indicating that a crossing over in one genomic segment increases the probability that a crossing over will occur in another genomic segment  while the second order coefficient parameter had an average value close to zero with a large variance 
The mechanism leading to these results will be discussed in the following section One major breakthrough in the work presented here lies in the space and time scales at which the experiments were performed 
Indeed  the processes occurring within the course of a single infection of one multi cellular host are of obvious biological relevance for any disease 
Previous studies on viral recombination suffered from major drawbacks in this respect  basing their conclusions on experiments relying on complementation among non infectious viruses or between viruses with undetermined relative fitness  on phylogenetically based analyses  or on experiments in cell cultures 
For reasons detailed in the Introduction  the first two methods either do not provide information on the frequency of recombination  but only its occurrence  or address the question at a different temporal  and often spatial  scale 
Results from cell cultures  on the other hand  impose cell co infection by different viral variants  potentially overestimating the frequency of recombination events 
Our study circumvents these limitations by analyzing viral genotypes sampled from infected plants after the course of a single infection  and therefore the invasion and co infection of cells in various organs and tissues is very close to natural More than half of the genomes       see Table   present in a CaMV population after a single passage in its host plant were identified as recombinants  and these data allowed us to infer a per nucleotide per generation recombination rate on the order of       to      
The time length of one generation  i e  the time required for a given genome to go from one replication to the next  is totally unknown in plant viruses 
The only experimental data available on CaMV are based on the kinetics of gene expression in infected protoplasts  where the capsid protein is produced between   and   h   
The reverse transcription and the encapsidation of genomic DNA being two coupled phenomena    we judged it reasonable to assume a generation time of   d and  thus  an average of ten generations during our experiments 
In case this estimate is mistaken  we have verified a linear relationship between r and the number of generations  thereby allowing an immediate adjustment of r if the CaMV generation time is more precisely established 
At this point  we must consider that all cloned genomes may not have been through all the successive replication events potentially allowed by the timing of our experiments 
It was previously shown that about   of CaMV mature virus particles accumulate in compact inclusion bodies    where they may be sequestered for a long time  as such inclusions are very frequent in all infected cells  including those in leaves that have been invaded by the virus population for several weeks 
The viral population may thus present an age structure that could bias the estimation of the recombination rate 
In order to minimize this bias  the clones we analyzed were collected in one young newly formed leaf  where the chances of finding genomes from  unsequestered lines  were assumed to be higher 
In any case  our data analysis is conservative  since this age structure can only lead to an underestimation of the recombination rate Our results show that interferences between pairs of loci are negative  a recombination event between two loci apparently increases the probability of recombination between another pair of loci 
We believe that the most parsimonious explanation of these negative interferences is based on the way the infection builds up within plant hosts 
Indeed  one can divide infected host cells into those infected by a single virus genotype and those infected by more than one viral genotype 
In the former  analogous to clonal propagation  recombination is undetectable 
In the latter  recombination is not only detectable but  as our results indicate  very frequent 
Samples consisting of viruses resulting from a mixture of these two types of host cell infections will thus contain viruses with no recombination and viruses with several recombination events  thus yielding an impression of negative interference 
These conceptual arguments are supported by mathematical models 
It is indeed easy to show  detailed results not shown  that if a proportion F of the population reproduces clonally  analogous to single infections  while the remaining reproduces panmictically  negative interferences could be inferred even if they do not exist 
For example  assuming a three locus model with real recombination rates r
  and r
  and interference i
  the  apparent  recombination and interference parameters  would be r
        F r  r
        F r
  and i
     F   i
    F 
Interestingly  this example also shows that our estimates of the recombination rate are conservative  that a fraction F of host cells are singly infected while others are multiply infected leads to an underestimation of the recombination rate As judged by r
  r
  and r
  calculated between markers a–b  b–c  and c–d  respectively  we found evidence for recombination through the entire CaMV genome 
The values for r
 
r
  and r
  are remarkably similar  hence the recombination sites seem to be evenly distributed along the genome 
We considered the template switching model as the major way recombinants are created in CaMV 
As already mentioned in the Introduction  hot spots of template switching have been predicted at the position of the  ′ extremities of the  S and  S RNAs   
If other recombination mechanisms  such as that associated with second strand DNA synthesis or with the host cell DNA repair machinery  act significantly  hot spots would be expected at the positions of the sequence interruption     and     
Due to the design of our experiment and the position of the four markers  we have no information on putative hot spots at positions corresponding to the  ′ end of the  S RNA and to    at nucleotide position  
Nevertheless  the putative hot spots at the  ′ end of the  S RNA and at   and    nucleotide positions   and   respectively  fall between marker pairs c–d  b–c  and a–b  respectively 
Our results indicate that either these hot spots are quantitatively equivalent though predicted by different recombination mechanisms or  more likely  that they simply do not exist 
Whatever the explanation  what we observe is that the CaMV can exchange any portion of its genome  and thus any gene thereof  with an astonishingly high frequency during the course of a single host infection To our knowledge  the viral recombination rate has never previously been quantified experimentally for a plant virus   
In contrast  retroviruses and particularly HIV  have been extensively investigated in that sense 
As we have already discussed for these latter cases  the quantification of the intrinsic recombination rate was carried out in artificially co infected cell cultures 
The estimated intrinsic per nucleotide per generation recombination rate in HIV  is on the order of      less than one order of magnitude higher than our estimation for CaMV 
Because for various reasons detailed above we probably underestimate the within host CaMV recombination rate  we believe that the intrinsic recombination rate in CaMV is higher and perhaps on the order of that of HIV Other pararetroviruses such as plant badnaviruses or vertebrate hepadnaviruses have a similar cycle within their host cells  including steps of nuclear minichromosome  genomic size RNA synthesis  and reverse transcription and encapsidation 
Nevertheless  vertebrate hepadnaviruses  e g  hepatitis B virus  infect hosts that are very different from plants in their biology and physiology  and this could lead to a totally different frequency of cell co infection during the development of the virus populations 
Thus  even though our results can be informative for other pararetroviruses because of the viruses  shared biological characteristics  they should not be extrapolated to vertebrate pararetroviruses without caution We used the plasmid pCa  which is the complete genome of the CaMV isolate Cabb S  cloned into the pBR  plasmid at the unique SalI restriction site   
To analyze recombination in different regions of the genome  we introduced four genetic markers  a  b  c  and d  at the positions       and   respectively  thus approximately at four cardinal points of the CaMV circular double stranded DNA of   bp  Figure  
All markers  each corresponding to a single nucleotide change  were introduced by PCR directed mutagenesis in pCa  and resulted in the duplication of previously unique restriction sites BsiWI  PstI  MluI  and SacI in a plasmid designated pMark S  Because  in this study  we targeted the possible exchange of genes between viral genomes  all markers a  b  c  and d were introduced within coding regions corresponding to open reading frames I  IV  V  and VI  respectively 
Another important concern was to quantify recombination in the absence of selection  i e  to create neutral markers 
Consequently all markers consist of synonymous mutations  see below To generate the parental virus particles  plasmids pCa  and pMark S were mechanically inoculated into individual plants as previously described   
All plants were turnips  B  rapa cv   Just Right  grown under glasshouse conditions at   °C with a    light dark  photoperiod 
Thirty days post inoculation  all symptomatic leaves were harvested and viral particles were purified as described earlier   The resulting preparations of parental viruses  designated Cabb S and Mark S  were quantified by spectrometry using the formula described by Hull et al 
  
We fixed the initial frequency of markers to a value of   and a solution containing   mg ml of virus particles of both Cabb S and Mark S at a   ratio was prepared 
Plantlets were co infected by mechanical inoculation of two to three leaves with   μl of this virus solution  using abrasive Celite AFA  Fluka  Ronkonkoma  New York  United States 
The mixed CaMV population was allowed to grow during   d of systemic infection We designed an experimental protocol for quantifying marker frequency within a mixed Cabb S Mark S virus population after a single passage in a host plant 
Twenty four individual plants  inoculated as above with equal amounts of Cabb S and Mark S  were harvested   d post inoculation  when symptoms were fully developed 
The viral DNA was purified from   mg of young newly formed infected leaves according to the protocol described previously   
After the precipitation step of this protocol  the viral DNA was resuspended and further purified with the Wizard DNA clean up kit  Promega  Fitchburg  Wisconsin  United States  in TE  X   mM Tris HCl and   mM EDTA  pH   
Aliquots of viral DNA preparations were digested by restriction enzymes corresponding either to marker a  b  c  or d and submitted to a   agarose gel electrophoresis  colored by ethydium bromide and exposed to UV 
Each individual restriction enzyme cut once in Cabb S DNA and twice in Mark S  thus generating DNA fragments of different sizes attributable to one or the other in the mixed population of CaMV genomes 
After scanning the agarose gels  we estimated the relative frequency of the two genotypes in each viral DNA preparation and at each marker position  by densitometry using the NIH   Image program 
The statistical analyses of the frequency of the four markers are described below To identify and quantify the recombinants within the CaMV mixed populations  aliquots from ten of the   viral DNA preparations described above were digested by the restriction enzyme SalI  and directly cloned into pUC  at the corresponding site 
In each of the ten viral populations analyzed    full genome length clones were digested separately by BsiWI  PstI  MluI  and SacI  to test for the presence of marker a  b  c  and d  respectively 
In this experiment  with the marker representing an additional restriction site  we could easily distinguish between the Cabb S and the Mark S genotype at all four marker positions  upon agarose gel   electrophoresis of the digested clones 
Clones with none or all four markers were parental genotypes  whereas clones harboring     or   markers were clearly recombinants 
Due to the very high number of recombinants detected  markers eventually appearing or disappearing due to spontaneous mutations were neglected Here we present the different methods we used to quantify recombination in the CaMV genome 
Because all these methods assume that the different markers are neutral  we first discuss assumption We used two datasets to test the neutrality of markers  both resulting from plants co infected with a   ratio of Mark S and Cabb S 
The first consisted of viral DNA densitometry data derived from   plants  described above  where for each plant we have an estimate of the frequency of each marker in the genome population 
The second consisted of the restriction of   individual full genome length viral clones obtained from one co infected plant  described above  yielding an estimate of the frequency of each marker  and this was repeated on ten different plants 
The frequencies of the different markers were       and   for markers a  b  c  and d in the first dataset and       and   in the second dataset 
We tested whether these frequencies were significantly different from the expected value under neutrality    using either t tests  for datasets where normality could not be rejected  seven out of eight cases  or Wilcoxon signed rank non parametric tests otherwise  marker c in the first dataset 
In all cases p values were larger than  There are several cautionary remarks regarding these analyses 
First  in all cases we found an excess of markers 
Unfortunately  the two datasets cannot be regarded as independent because  even though the methods through which the frequency estimates were obtained were different  the plants used in the second dataset were a subset of the plants of the first 
We thus have only four independent estimates in each case  and there is minimal power to detect significant deviations from neutrality with such a small sample size 
It should be noted at this stage that deviations from the expected value could also be caused either by slight deviations from the   ratio in the infecting mixed solution  or by deviations from that ratio in the frequency of the viral particles that actually get into the plants 
Second  because of the relatively small sample sizes and low statistical power  the tests presented above could have detected only large deviations The results clearly show  however  precisely that the markers do not have large effects  if any  and that therefore recombination estimates would be affected only very slightly by any hypothetical selective effects of the markers 
Because of this  along with the fact that the introduced markers provoke silent substitutions in the CaMV genome  we assumed that markers were effectively neutral in the rest of the analysis The dataset used to estimate the recombination frequency consisted of the   full genome length viral clones   from each of ten co infected plants  individually genotyped for each of the four markers 
As discussed in detail in the Results  recombination was very frequent and concerned all four markers 
Indeed  approximately half of the genotyped clones exhibited a recombinant genotype 
It was therefore meaningful to try to obtain quantitative estimates of recombination from our data Our aim was to analyze viral recombination in a live host 
Consequently  we had to deal with the fact that more than one viral replication cycle occurred during the   d that infection lasted in our experiment  we had to wait that long for the disease to develop and to be able to recover sufficient amounts of viral DNA from each infection 
Based on the kinetics of gene expression    we postulate that each replication cycle lasts between   and   d  and that therefore seven to ten cycles occurred between infection and the sampling time 
In case this assumption is incorrect  we did calculations assuming five  seven  ten  or   replication cycles during these   d  As shown  the results were not affected qualitatively  and only slightly quantitatively 
It is important to note that we assumed that recombination occurred through a template switching mechanism  and that therefore  from a recombination point of view  the CaMV genome is linear 
The reverse transcription starts and finishes at the position   in Figure   which is the point of circularization of the DNA genome 
This implies that changes between contiguous markers a–b  b–c  and c–d can be considered as true recombination whereas those between a and d cannot  as they may simply stem from circularization of DNA  during the synthesis of which the polymerase has switched template once anywhere between a–b  b–c  or c–d To estimate the recombination rate between markers  we wrote recurrence equations describing the change in frequency of each genotype over one generation  assuming random mating and no selection  i e  the standard Wright–Fisher population genetics model 
We then expressed the frequency of all possible genotypes n generations later as a function of their initial frequency and of the recombination parameters 
Subsequently we calculated the maximum likelihood estimates of the recombination parameters and their asymptotic variances given initial frequencies  we assumed that the two  parental  genotypes  Mark S and Cabb S  had equal initial frequencies of   and that all other genotypes had initial frequencies of zero  and frequencies after n generations  the observed frequencies  as stated above we used different values of n 
All algebraic and numerical calculations were carried out with the software Mathematica The recombination parameters are the recombination rates between two adjacent loci  e g  r
  for the recombination rate between markers a and b  and the interference coefficients  e g  i
  for interference between recombination events in the segments between markers a and b and b and c  To define these parameters we followed Christiansen    and in particular the recombination distributions for two  three  and four loci  respectively  Tables     and   of   
It is important to realize that given the definitions of these parameters  the estimator of the recombination rate between two loci is not affected by the number of loci considered 
In other words  we obtain the same estimation of the recombination rate between markers a and b whether we consider genotypic frequencies at just these two loci  or the frequencies at these two loci plus a third locus  or the complete information to which we have access  the four marker genotypes 
Information on additional loci only affects the estimates of the interference coefficients It proved impossible to carry out the calculations for four loci algebraically 
Instead  we used a computer program to calculate the expected genotypic frequencies at all four loci after n generations  given the above stated initial frequencies and specified recombination parameters 
For each combination of recombination parameters we calculated a Euclidean distance between the vector of the expected genotypic frequencies and the observed genotypic frequencies  and considered that the estimated recombination parameters were those yielding the minimal Euclidean distance 
In all cases  the estimated recombination rates between pairs of loci were equal to the second decimal to those estimated algebraically from data for three or two loci Tumor Restrictions to Oncolytic VirusIn most solid tumors the tumor interior displays a high cellular density with multiple cell types  both malignant and normal  stromal  cells  interdigitated by strands of extracellular matrix  ECM  and other poorly defined tissue 
Stromal cells typically consist of fibroblasts  macrophages  neutrophils and other immune cell types 
Tumor associated fibroblasts are a source of the bulk acellular tissue in tumors    which is largely made up of polysugars and glycoproteins  such as collagens  laminins  fibronectins  proteoglycans  hyaluronan and water  forming a dense matrix around and between the cancer cells   
This matrix provides structural support but also haptotactic and chemotactic guidance for cancer cells   
Moreover  the prevailing tumor interstitium is rich in soluble angiogenic factors  such as members of the vascular endothelial growth factor  VEGF  family    cellular growth factors  including endothelial growth factor  EGF  basic fibroblast growth factor  FGF  platelet derived growth factor  PDGF  and pleiotrophic factors  particularly transforming growth factor  TGF  beta   
Additionally  both tumor  and stromal cells secrete cytokines and chemokines  such as interleukin  IL    IL   tumor necrosis factor  TNF  alpha  stromal cell derived factor  SDF    macrophage migration inhibitory factor  MIF    which on one hand recruit more stromal and progenitor cells into the tumors and on the other hand curb the activity of antigen presenting cells and anti tumor T cells   
In several independent cancer types  high serum levels of IL   and IL   are indicators of poor prognosis   Aberrant tumor and stromal growth combined with an overproduction of matrix leads to high interstitial pressure in the tumor  preventing lateral diffusion of therapeutic compounds within the tumor 
Tight cellular compactness combined with a high tumor proliferation rate also causes physical crowding and puts constraints on oxygenation  which due to aberrant angiogenesis and rupture of the haphazard vessels is mostly incomplete and results in chronic tissue hypoxia toward the tumor cores 
As cancer cells exist in a crowding hypoxic  and cytokine growth factor perpetuated chronic state of stress  they upregulate a number of key cellular molecules that function as a collective defense against a wide range of therapies  including oncolytic viruses 
The properties of oncolytic viruses and their status in clinical development as well as various delivery options have been reviewed elsewhere   
In this review  we provide an overview of two of the main intratumoral barriers to oncolytic virus spread  the extracellular tumor make up and the intracellular antiviral defense mechanisms Tumor cellular structure and composition may in concert with abundant extracellular matrix  ECM  deposition pose a severe hurdle for systemic virus entry and propagation of infection within the tumor 
The extracellular matrix is a complex dense network consisting of multiple proteins  glycoproteins and polysaccharides including collagens  laminins  fibronectins  proteoglycans and hyaluronic acid   
The interstitial fluid pressure  IFP  in the tumor surrounding blood and lymphatic vessels is mainly created by the high cell density that forms an increased physical pressure outwards and does not allow free diffusion of therapeutics   
A high IFP generally predicts an aggressive tumor phenotype as tumor cells tend to escape from tumor margins where the pressure drops  thus facilitating spread of metastatic cells   
On the other hand  for therapeutic virus  interstitial fluid concentration gradients may pose a hurdle as passive diffusion in viable regions  typically the rim  may occur mainly outward   
Given the limited arsenal of known chemicals alleviating tumor compactness and the poor penetration drugs in general into the tumor tissue  this is a considerable problem that may not be easy to tackle 
Some strategies are discussed below Viruses are passive particles and rely either on radial cell to cell spread or on soluble diffusion across concentration gradients to reach their target cells and to propagate the infection 
Tumor matrix is critical in this regard  as it can block both forms of spread 
Passively diffusing viruses may physically not fit through the strands of the ECM 
This was shown for oncolytic herpes virus  which has an outer diameter of over   nm  and whose spreading could be improved by matrix degrading bacterial collagenase co injection   
Bilbao and coworkers showed that adenovirus entry into experimental hepatocellular carcinoma nodules in the livers of immunocompetent rats following intravenous or intraportal injection was directly related to the thickness of the ECM capsule enveloping the nodules   
On the other hand  we found using Semliki Forest virus  which has an outer diameter of about   nm  that even upon intratumoral injection spread was blocked by ECM  which formed a physical barrier for virus infection  Figure  The foremost option to reduce interstitial fluid pressure and to remove physical molecule barriers imposed by the ECM is to use matrix degrading enzymes 
These act by digesting collagen  fibrin  and other types of fibrillar matrix deposits  creating more space between cell clusters  and glycosaminoglycan polymers  known to limit fluid movement in tumors 
Simultaneously  such strategies may also expose more cell surface to viruses  increasing the likelihood of infection 
In a study by Kuriyama  trypsin or collagenase dispase was injected into subcutaneous U  and U  glioma xenografts in immunocompromised mice  followed by a reporter adenovirus   
Both types of ECM degrading enzymes increased tumor transduction by the virus  but when doses got too high  transduction efficacy suffered  demonstrating a balance between ECM degradation and oncolytic virus efficacy 
In another study  treatment of PC  tumors with vaccinia virus producing matrix metalloprotease  MMP    resulted in reduction of collagen IV fibrils and increase in virus penetration into tumor  which yielded elevated virus titers   
Hong et al 
targeted orthotopic neuroblastoma xenografts engineered to express MMP  with oncolytic HSV  achieving increased virus distribution compared to control tumors   
Similar results were obtained when human soft tissue sarcoma HSTS T overexpressing MMP  or MMP  were injected with oncolytic HSV   
MMP expressing tumors contained significantly less sulfated glycosaminoglycans compared to control tumors 
Other enzymes and protein effectors  either engineered into virus expression cassettes or provided exogenously  include hyaluronidase  decorin  various other MMPs  and notably relaxin a peptide hormone normally expressed during particular phase of pregnancy that does not possess tissue degrading activity itself  but instead induces a number of key collagen degrading proteases seemingly in a tumor specific manner   
Beyer showed that relaxin expressed by murine stem cells improved trastuzumab penetrance and therapy outcome in syngeneic tumor models   
In another study  chimeric adenovirus Ad  expressing relaxin showed increased tumor transduction and virus dissemination   Several other strategies to increase penetration of therapeutics in tumors have been developed   
While the stromal ECM capsule of tumor nodules acts as a physical barrier to virus entry following intravenous injection  it was possible to improve tumor infection by administering vaso active compounds  angiotensin II  histamine  nitroglycerine  before the virus   
This is interesting  as vasculature per se would not be expected to alter or influence the physical composition of the ECM  such as collagen strand thickness 
Instead  virus access to the tumor was improved  most likely by increased access from the blood via tumor stromal adjoining vessels 
Interestingly  in a study with oncolytic herpes virus  anti VEGF monoclonal antibody Bevacizumab given before intravenous virus injection gave poorer anti tumor efficacy than when given after the virus   
The study showed that while HSV is able to enter and infect tumors better through their leaky vasculature compared to Bevacizumab normalized vasculature  vascular normalization by Bevacizumab still gave superior combination efficacy when the virus was already in the tumor 
This effect was likely dependent on altering both physical and biological properties of the tumor  including interstitial pressure and oxygenation 
In another study  anti VEGF A antibody injections in nude mice harboring U  human glioma xenografts led to an increase in MMP  expression and reduction in collagen fiber content  facilitating improved distribution of oncolytic adenovirus within the tumor tissue   
In general  targeting tumor vasculature by oncolytic viruses and including agents that affect tumor vasculature in combination regimens is gaining interest    and it will be interesting to see more specific studies on how vascular acting agents may affect the physical barriers to oncolytic viruses Some viruses do not need an extracellular step for propagating infection  such as members of the herpes and poxvirus families  and may be able to spread from cell to cell 
For example  HSV  is able to infect neighboring cells via lateral tight junctions in a manner dependent on its glycoproteins E and I   
Vaccinia virus  on the other hand  induces so called actin tails  which are actin filament driven membranous protrusions of the plasma membrane harboring a single virus particle at the outer tip 
These actin tails actively deliver and deposit virus particles onto or even into neighboring cells   
Because lateral spread without an extracellular step may circumvent neutralizing immunity as well as some of the physical obstacles the tumor microenvironment imposes  this ability has been engineered into viruses that normally do not possess it 
A promising strategy is to engineer OVs to express membrane fusogenic genes  MFGs  such as gibbon ape leukemia virus  GALV  glycoprotein  reptilian reovirus p  protein  FAST  or the membrane glycoproteins H and F of measles virus   
Quite intriguingly  expression of several different MFGs by oncolytic adenovirus synergized with chemotherapy in anti tumor efficacy both in vitro and in vivo    suggesting that membrane fusion facilitated lateral spread of also chemotherapeutics  which otherwise would not have occurred in a compact tumor 
The potential limitation of cell to cell dependent spread  however  may be that membrane free physical barriers  such as the ECM  may still pose a barrier to spread 
Also  it is unclear whether MFGs or other mechanisms of lateral spread may assist in reaching distant tumor nests Some other strategies to alleviate matrix imposed restrictions to oncolytic viruses have been discussed elsewhere   Tumors of epithelial origin mostly retain the firm cellular integrity seen in their original adhesive intercellular configuration 
Several viruses use cellular receptors which are located in paracellular tight junctions  which may be problematic in tightly packed tumors   
Adenovirus C group viruses use coxsackie adenovirus receptor  CAR  as their primary entry point  whereas adenovirus B  group members and measles virus Edmonston use CD  complement binding molecule as their cellular receptor   
Adenovirus B  group  serotypes       and   entry occurs using desmoglein   DSG    
Of these  CAR and DSG  are preferentially located within tight junctions and are hidden from virus binding   
Also the complement receptor CD  was ascribed a role in maintenance of epithelial cell integrity by interactions with the E cadherin catenin network   
These observations imply that before reaching the potential entry site on the tumor cell the virus must find its way into the junctional space 
Moreover  it has become increasingly clear that for example glioma tumors traditionally targeted by Ad  serotype adenoviruses often express only low levels of CAR and instead much higher levels of CD    Beyond that tight junctions hide multiple virus receptors  they contain a network of adhesion molecules  including ZO  cadherins  claudins and occludin  which  if perturbed  is associated with more aggressive disease in many types of cancer   
Since tight junctions also contain important receptors that mediate tumor promoting signaling and which have been targeted by monoclonal antibodies  notably Her  it would be highly useful to develop strategies that temporarily loosen the tight junction contacts even at cost of a transient increase in tumor metastatic risk 
One of the most interesting approaches has been to exploit the natural propensity of adenovirus serotype   which as part of its natural life cycle creates dodecahedral particles  PtDd  consisting of viral capsid proteins  penton base and fiber that open tight junctions by binding to and dissolving desmoglein  dimers and reducing E cadherin expression  to develop a specific tight junction opening molecule  JO    
Adenovirus type   uses PtDds to promote its own infection  opening the tight junctions ahead of infection to maximize access to desmoglein 
Analogously  when administered to human tumor xenografts  JO  facilitated penetration of trastuzumab much deeper into the tumor tissue than when the monoclonal antibody was administered on its own   
Moreover  JO  synergized with several chemotherapeutics in solid tumor models   
Backed by our own findings with oncolytic SFV  showing that both extracellular matrix and tumor cell compactness restrict virus spread and oncolytic efficacy  we believe combination approaches that target both tight junctions and extracellular matrix will prove effective in future virotherapy development  Figure  An alternative approach to increasing tumor penetration by oncolytic viruses is to alter tumor cell morphology and status 
Notably  cell death and in particular the type of cell death induced by virus has been shown to affect virus distribution within a tumor mass  in a study by Nagano et al  administration of apoptosis inducing paclitaxel before injecting oncolytic herpes simplex virus increased virus dissemination in the tumor  allowing its diffuse in  tunnels  created by shrinking dying tumor cells   Maintenance of physiological adherence is essential for proper ECM function and for retaining cellular integrity 
Therefore  a potential caveat of using ECM degrading proteolytic enzymes or tight junction openers is the risk of neoplastic cell detachment from the tumor ECM and increased risk of metastasis 
While ECM degradation or tight junction opening may operate innocuously  there is also a chance that loss of E cadherins via proteases or via non specific deregulation of tight junction integrity during ECM modulating therapy could trigger pro tumorigenic Wnt β catenin signaling  possibly driving epithelial to mesenchymal transition   
One study showed that ectopic relaxin expression stimulated MMP expression and enhanced breast cancer invasiveness    whereas another paper found short term relaxin exposure to increase breast cancer cell motility whereas long term expression reduced both motility and cancer invasiveness   
In the context of oncolytic viruses  Lavilla Alonso tested several proteases  including hyaluronidase  relaxin  and macrophage metalloelastase  and showed they all could assist adenovirus entry into tumors  yet  the authors did not detect treatment induced metastases or increase in tumor invasiveness   
Another strategy possibly balancing some of the putative risks of tight junction disruption could be to use Wnt dependent oncolytic viruses   Tumors are invariably fenestrated by host fibroblasts  myeloid cells and other non transformed cells  which driven by cancer induced cues can adopt various reprogrammed phenotypes to promote tumor angiogenesis and growth and to alter tumor responses to therapies   
As most of them normally play a role in immune homeostasis and pathogen sensing  they also respond to and influence oncolytic virus infection of tumors Fulci et al 
reported that injection of oncolytic HSV  directly into glioblastoma tumor parenchyma triggered upregulation of CD  and CD  monocytic markers and rapid clearance of virus  likely executed by infiltrating phagocytic cells   
When clodronate liposomes were used to deplete macrophages in vivo  the authors observed a  fold increase in virus titers in the brain tumors concomitant with an   reduction in peripheral CD  macrophages in animal spleens  suggesting that CD  cells migrate into the tumors upon virus injection and limit overall oncolytic efficacy 
While CD  cells were not reduced by peripheral macrophage depletion  arguing that these cells had been recruited to the tumors before the treatment  they could be eliminated in live glioma slices ex vivo  resulting in a  fold increase in virus replication 
Macrophages may secrete antiviral type I interferon constitutively at very low  subnanomolar  levels   and recently Liu et al 
showed that tumor resident CD  macrophages induced a protective antiviral state in ovarian and breast tumors which led to resistance to oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus  VSV  infection   
Type I IFN signaling  JAK  inhibitor Ruxolitinib reversed the resistance  facilitating VSV replication in the macrophage protected cancer cells 
It is tempting to speculate that tumor resident macrophages also rendered syngeneic GL  and DBT mouse gliomas completely refractory to VA  oncolytic alphavirus  as these cells were quite infectable in vitro and live glioma slices regained their sensitivity to virus within   h  indicating dilution of IFN I   Macrophages or the closely related myeloid suppressor cells are the predominant stromal cell type in many tumors and are actively recruited during cancer progression   
Heavy macrophage presence in the tumors indicates that such tumors may be resistant to oncolytic virotherapy  unless depleting preconditioning would be used 
Moreover  as part of the early immune response to virus infection  monocytic cells are rapidly recruited to tumors following intratumoral virus injection 
In one study  depletion of either CD b  cells or VEGF secreted by these cells in mice treated with oncolytic HSV  greatly increased oncolytic efficacy  tentatively linking pro tumorigenic and antiviral angiogenic mechanisms   Another key pro tumorigenic signaling employed by many tumors is up regulation of CXCR  the receptor for chemokine CXCL   also known as SDF  and recruitment of stromal cells expressing CXCL  which maintain the tumor and recruit additional cells to support tumor expansion and invasion  such as endothelial cell progenitors which contribute to neovascularization   
Indeed  high CXCR  expression is a negative prognostic factor for many cancers 
Oncolytic vaccinia virus engineered to express a soluble antagonist of CXCR  showed improved intratumoral virus replication  increased vascular disruption and a markedly reduced infiltration of the tumors by putative immune suppressive and tumor promoting stromal cells   
This study highlights how reducing pro tumor stromal cell effects may alleviate antiviral resistance and yield increased overall therapeutic efficacy 
On the other hand  if the paracrine antiviral effects of tumor homing monocytic cells could be selectively abrogated these cells could favorably be used to ferry oncolytic viruses into tumors 
Indeed  a significant delay in metastatic tumor potential was achieved when macrophages were harnessed to deliver a tumor specific oncolytic adenovirus   What is the antiviral status in human cancer 
Recent analyses from different normal cells that occupy the same organ reveal striking functional variation in components of the type I IFN signaling pathway that correlate with the tissue tropism and virulence of some virus strains   
Can similar variation in such components be found in cancer cells  or do cancer cells make an exception Transformed cells undergo selective elimination by the immune system before becoming cancerous  termed immunoediting  based on observations of differential capacity of immunocompetent mice to reject tumors previously grown in immunocompromised hosts versus syngeneic animals   
Cancer cell responsiveness to type I and type II IFNs plays a role during immunoediting  cancer cells that eventually progress to form a tumor display reduced capacity to respond to IFN gamma  which otherwise would upregulate MHC class I molecules and render the tumors amenable to CD  T cell mediated destruction  whereas responsiveness to type I interferon initially helps tumors avoid immune purging during the editing phase and is then irrelevant   
Of note  the anti tumor effects of type I IFN  still exploited today in several cancers  were shown to depend on host NK cells  and mice in which IFNAR was blocked by monoclonal antibody failed to reject even highly immunogenic tumors  as opposed to mice treated with control antibody  who all rejected the immunogenic tumor challenge   
Thus  whereas tumor responsiveness to type I IFN is not predetermined after immunoediting  other factors post immunoediting may influence it In several tumor types  varying levels of expression of components of the type I IFN signaling cascade have been detected  and in some tumor types these components have been found to have prognostic value  whereas in others they do not seem to influence survival   
However  emerging data suggests that antiviral genes may predict poor survival because they increase treatment resistance 
In one study  poor prognosis of several types of cancer due to genotoxic treatment resistance was found to correlate with increased activity of IFN I pathway genes   
In this study  a triad of type I IFN signaling pathway genes  STAT  ISG  and IFIT  formed a pan tumor type negative prognostic factor  and a broader seven gene cluster established negative prognostic criteria for treatment resistant breast cancer 
Treatment resistance was subsequently shown to depend on STAT  signaling  STAT expressing tumor clones were positively selected in animals in vivo  demonstrating increased proliferation and metastatic potential  and STAT expression mediated resistance against genotoxic assault by doxorubicin or ionizing radiation  knockdown of STAT  resulted in lower proliferation rate and metastatic capacity and increased sensitivity to genotoxic stress    
In another study  resistance to epigenetic DNA modifiers  AZA dC  a methyltransferase inhibitor  and LBH  or MGCD  both histone deacetylase  HDAC  inhibitors  was correlated with increased expression of IFN I pathway genes in small lung cancer cells   
Basal IFN related gene expression in several different SML cell lines was upregulated Interestingly  in many cancers  STAT proteins are not phosphorylated and persist in unphosphorylated form  U STAT 
Like its phosphorylated counterpart  U STAT  increases expression of genes contributing to resistance to DNA damaging agents   
While it is currently unknown why cancers may prefer to use unphosphorylated forms  it is known that U STATs activate distinct signals compared to their phosphorylated counterparts 
However  importantly for oncolytic viruses  in many tumors  constant expression and release of type I IFN leads to a constitutively high level of unphosphorylated forms of STAT  STAT  and IRF  which together form an unphosphorylated but functional ISGF like complex that relocalizes to the nucleus and drives expression of a specific set of ISGs distinct from acute IFN I exposure   
These ISGs are sufficient to maintain a functional antiviral defense and they play a critical role in resistance to DNA damaging agents On a cellular level  virus replication is controlled by antiviral defense molecules    which in turn are primarily controlled by type I IFN signaling 
In addition to classical type I IFN  or cytokine induced antiviral signaling  tumors may employ other antiviral defense mechanisms 
For example  stromal cells may secrete peptides with antiviral properties called defensins   
The defensins are amphiphatic and typically  –  amino acids in length and interfere with viruses by physically binding to and disrupting virus particles and or by inducing antiviral responses in target cells via pattern recognition receptors 
At least oral squamous cell carcinomas were found to overexpress defensins compared to normal control tissues   
While the role of defensins in oncolytic virus infection of tumors is unclear  one study showed that the immune stimulating properties of defensins may be exploited to increase overall therapeutic efficacy 
In this study  expression of beta   defensin from a conditionally replicating adenovirus yielded a superior therapeutic entity compared to the unarmed parental virus via enhanced anti tumor immune responses mediated by TLR dependent activation of dendritic cells   In summary  human cancers display varying degrees of expression of antiviral proteins or their signaling regulators at baseline 
Some of these may increase in response to genotoxic anti cancer treatments 
In the next chapter we will highlight some of the consequences to oncolytic virotherapy of the heterogeneity in type I IFN responsiveness in tumor cells All oncolytic viruses tested to date display variable infectivity in different cancer cell lines 
This variability is likely at least partly dependent on type I IFN as most oncolytic viruses are IFN sensitive 
IFN secretion follows virus sensing by the cells via Toll like receptors expressed on both the plasma membrane and in endocytotic vesicles  NOD like receptors  STING  AIM  NLP inflammosome and other danger sensing molecules  summarized elsewhere   
While all viruses carry an arsenal of counteracting molecules    no virus goes completely undetected 
Even HSV amplicons  which are devoid of functional virus genes  induce a type I IFN response that mediates a STAT dependent system wide antiviral defense in mice within one hour of intravenous vector injection  resulting in significant reduction of transgene expression compared to expression in STAT  knockout animals   During our own studies with attenuated SFV vector VA  it became apparent that the dramatic and lasting therapeutic efficacy achieved following mere single intravenous  or intratumoral  injection of the virus in immunocompromised mice bearing human A  melanoma or U  glioma xenografts   was not going to be recapitulated easily in immunocompetent animals   
The paradox in our studies was that while oncolytic SFV vector VA  effectively replicated in and destroyed a variety of IFN responsive cancer cell lines in vitro  it consistently failed to eradicate tumors generated from the same cell types in vivo  even if large doses of virus were injected directly into the tumor mass and even if the tumors were void of visible physical barriers  Figure  
Conversely  only tumors generated from IFN unresponsive cancer cells have seemed infectable in vivo by VA  so far 
In light of earlier findings by others  showing that type I IFN receptor knockout mice are highly susceptible to SFV infection and quickly succumb to multi organ systemic infection    the parameters for oncolytic SFV efficacy seem clear  tumor cells must be defective in type I IFN response for the virus to be effective These findings are in line with emerging data from other groups  showing a remarkably strict dependence of oncolytic virus replication on defective type I IFN responsiveness  a dogma introduced at the turn of the  st century   
For example  sarcomas and melanomas display differing permissiveness to oncolytic VSV  an obstacle which may be overcome by blocking type I IFN signaling   
In eight sarcoma cell lines  basal up regulation of RIG I and IFIT  and rapid induction of STAT  phosphorylation upon IFN I treatment correlated with resistance to oncolytic measles virus   
In other studies  human pancreatic and ovarian cancer cells display resistance against Rb dependent oncolytic adenovirus  strongly correlating with intracellular levels of MxA  and acquired resistance to repeated oncolytic adenovirus injections in an intraperitoneal ovarian carcinoma model was associated with an increase in MxA as well as several other key ISGs in the tumors   
A study comparing normal human or mouse melanocytes to a panel of melanoma cells revealed strong correlation between permissiveness to oncolytic VSV and capacity to mount antiviral defense in response to type I IFN   
In this study  VSV rp  harboring two mutations in P and L genes  was superior to several other tested oncolytic VSV strains  but the dependence on defective IFN responsiveness was still retained 
In yet another study  oncolytic VSV replicated in four out of twelve mesothelioma cell lines which were unable to mount antiviral defense upon IFN beta pretreatment or to respond to infection by up regulation of PKR  MxA or  OAS mRNA   
In contrast  the non permissive mesothelioma cells mounted antiviral defense  associated with PKR  MxA or  OAS mRNA up regulation  in response to infection or to exogenous type I IFN 
The authors of this study further linked the observed pattern of virus resistance to clinical mesothelioma samples  where in a mesothelioma tissue array  significant variance in immunoreactivity against PKR  p  and or IFNAR was observed  with only a few samples displaying lack of reactivity against all three components  arguing that most tumors in clinical settings would display at least some level of resistance to oncolytic VSV Oncolytic adenoviruses are often deleted for E A  which normally binds Rb and prevents it from sequestering E F  which results in the viruses being unable to replicate in normal cells 
However  since adenovirus  as with all viruses  contains elements that antagonize antiviral defenses  such elements have also been targets for deletion to render the virus sensitive to innate antiviral defenses  which would be expected to remain intact only in normal cells 
Cancer cells expressing Ras may down regulate protein kinase R and inhibit type I IFN induction by interfering with RIG I signaling   
Also  select interferon stimulated genes appear to be repressed by the Ras MEK ERK signaling cascade   
PKR activation shuts down E F dependent translation  including translation of virus messenger RNAs 
Therefore  an adenovirus deleted for VA RNA  which antagonizes PKR  should be capable of replicating in Ras overexpressing  tumor  cells 
However  while this was seemingly the case    it was later discovered that Ras is not an obligatory determinant for PKR inactivation and that virus replication was halted even in Ras overexpressing cells via functional PKR mediated E F phosphorylation  implying that the parameters of VA RNA deleted adenovirus replication had to be revised   
Similar findings were obtained with oncolytic reovirus  against which Ras independent tumor resistance emerged in vivo   
Thus  under some circumstances even tumor cells over expressing Ras may respond to type I IFN or to stimulants of pattern recognition receptors  activating PKR and inhibiting virus translation 
To complicate matters  MEK inhibitors have been shown restore antiviral signaling capacity in Ras overexpressing tumors   
This implies that human tumors treated with MEK inhibitors  such as Trametinib which was recently approved for treatment of BRAF mutated melanoma  may be poor targets for oncolytic viruses as antiviral signaling capacity in such tumors may be restored Some oncolytic viruses  such as members of the poxvirus family  are seemingly resistant to the antiviral effects of type I IFNs in vitro and may be controlled by other cellular factors   
However  in most cases  sensitivity or resistance to type I IFN is assessed in vitro and using only one cytokine  which may mask synergies with other factors present in vivo 
One possible explanation for the in vitro–in vivo discrepancy is the tumor micro environment  which not only imposes physical barriers to oncolytic viruses but also alters intracellular antiviral defenses 
For example  glioma cells were found in the brain to spontaneously secrete type I IFN  which conferred resistance against oncolytic HSV 
Resistance was linked to ECM protein CCN  interaction with glioma cell surface receptor alpha   beta   integrin  which activated interferon secretion   
It is tempting to speculate whether this or a similar ECM glioma interaction could have contributed to the resistance of syngeneic glioma cells we observed in vivo but not in vitro to both oncolytic SFV and vaccinia virus  FIG    
Also  while critical in many respects  antiviral signaling may occur without signaling via type I IFN receptor  IFNAR 
For instance  upon infection of IFNAR KO mice with murine hepatitis virus  MHV  brain cells were found to have upregulated antiviral GTPase TGTP and IFITm  and IFITm  all of which have confirmed antiviral activity in vivo against a variety of viruses   
In these cases  IFN gamma and TNF alpha likely account for at least part of the observed ISG activity  where e g  TGTP is upregulated by IFN γ signaling and TNFα has been shown to induce ISG  independently of IFNAR   Interestingly  while most cancers are heterogeneous in antiviral defence signaling  one broad class of tumors in particular may display consistently low capacity to ward off oncolytic viruses  oncovirus induced cancers 
This is because oncoviruses  as all viruses  carry a complement of factors that abrogate antiviral sensors and effectors  which may result in tumors that are uniformly devoid of antiviral signaling 
In an intriguing study  oncolytic VSV infected and destroyed human papilloma virus  HPV positive cervical carcinoma cells more effectively than HPV negative head  and neck cancer cells due to HPV E mediated suppression of antiviral signaling   
HPV positive or E expressing xenografts were efficiently eradicated from nude mice following VSV injection 
The potential of this approach is that even oncolytic viruses that are extremely sensitive to type I IFN  such as attenuated SFV or M mutated VSV  may function well against oncovirus induced cancers where the oncovirus machinery ensures the lack of antiviral defense While on first thought it would appear counterintuitive to antagonize the very factors that keep oncolytic viruses tumor specific  emerging data shows that this can be accomplished in a safe way 
One of the foremost strategies to increase oncolytic virus efficacy is to combine them with drugs that lower tumor antiviral defenses 
In this regard  a primary target for interference is the prototypical type I IFN signaling cascade 
While small molecular inhibitors against IFNAR are not available  activity of downstream signaling transducers may effectively be blocked 
Human pancreatic cancer cells were shown to constitutively express high levels of MxA and OAS and to mount type I IFN dependent resistance to oncolytic VSV 
Resistance could be overcome by blocking activity of IFNAR associated Janus kinase  JAK      
Similarly  JAK  inhibitor ruxolitinib overcame type I IFN dependent resistance of human SCC  head and neck cancer cells against oncolytic VSV   
Ruxolitinib also successfully abrogated type I IFN mediated antiviral effects elicited by macrophages    highlighting that this drug might also alleviate type I IFN dependent tumor resistance to oncolytic viruses imposed by stromal cells 
However  the obvious downside to using JAK inhibitors is their effects on critical host defense mechanisms  which may result in increased infection of normal cells 
Moreover  JAK inhibitors may reduce anti tumor immune responses elicited by oncolytic virotherapy 
For example  ruxolitinib was shown to impair the capacity of dendritic cells promote CD  T cell responses against model tumor antigens   
On the other hand  in this study clearance of adenovirus was delayed in ruxolitinib treated normal animals  which makes it difficult to predict the overall impact of JAK inhibitors on tumor therapy where prolonged virus presence might translate to better therapeutic efficacy 
Also  while the immune stimulating and anti tumor effects of type I and type II interferons may be adversely affected by JAK inhibitors  central tumor promoting cascades mediated by JAKs  such as IL STAT  may also be inhibited    yielding a difficult to predict net therapeutic outcome 
At the moment  more studies are needed to establish the overall impact of interference with JAK  signaling in cancer therapy Spurred by earlier reports of oncovirus reactivation and promoter enhancement by histone deacetylase  HDAC  inhibitors  this class of agents was assessed for capacity to enhance oncolytic virus potency by inhibiting antiviral responses 
Indeed  such enhancement was observed with oncolytic VSV and SFV  and while it has been difficult to pinpoint the exact mechanisms that underlie HDAC inhibitor enhancement of oncolytic virus replication in cancer cells  antiviral defenses in general are inhibited for yet unknown reasons mainly in cancer cells and not in normal cells  which indirectly facilitates virus replication   
Interestingly  combination of HDAC inhibitors with conditionally replicating   E A deleted adenovirus gave improved virus replication rate and therapeutic efficacy in subcutaneous xenograft models only when the inhibitors were given before the virus  otherwise inhibition of replication was observed   
Similarly  HDAC inhibitors increased replication and oncolytic efficacy of HSV when given before the virus but not when given at the same time   
With nuclear DNA viruses  such as adenovirus and HSV  it is possible that HDAC inhibitors also alter virus genome accessibility to transcription factors  resulting in reduced replication or other adverse effects  implying that with these viruses HDAC inhibitors should be administered before the viruses Recently  it was found that HDAC inhibitor vorinostat activates NfκB signaling by facilitating hyperacetylation of the p  subunit  which in turn activates cellular autophagy   
Autophagy was in another study shown to be important for VSV replication  presumably by inhibiting antiviral signaling 
This is interesting  as a previous study revealed enhancement of VSV replication by inhibiting TNF alpha induced antiviral signaling mediated by p  using NfκB inhibitors BMS  or TPCA    
In this study  neither inhibitor had an effect on STAT  or STAT  phosphorylation or their nuclear relocalization in response to type I IFN but the authors observed clear induction of ISG  GBP  and MX  in response to type I IFN in U  glioma cells  with the latter two being dependent on NfκB signaling 
Taken together  NfκB pathway activation may result in different antiviral responses in different cancer types  and inhibition or enhancement of oncolytic viruses by NfκB inhibitors is dependent on other concomitant cellular mechanisms  such as autophagy Since HDAC inhibitors modulate promoter activity accessibility  it is conceivable other epigenetic or promoter modifying agents could work in a similar manner to repress antiviral defense induction and enhance oncolytic viruses   
DNA demethylating agents  azacytidine  Aza  and decitabine synergized with oncolytic herpes simplex type   virus in glioma models in vitro and in vivo  as did HDAC inhibitor valproic acid  VPA  which was already shown before to work well with oncolytic HSV as well as several other oncolytic viruses   
Moreover  inhibition of cancer antiviral defenses  specifically RNAseL and PKR  resulted when cancer cells were exposed to sunitinib  a multi tyrosine kinase inhibitor originally developed as an inhibitor of VEGF R and PDGF R signaling  yielding strong anti tumor synergy with IFN sensitive oncolytic VSV   
Since sunitinib is approved for renal cell carcinoma and imatinib resistant gastric cancers  combination with oncolytic VSV constitutes a promising and clinically relevant approach warranting further investigation 
Interstingly  sunitinib as well as several other receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors displayed antiviral effects against polyomavirus BK    arguing that these compounds are not universal virus enhancers Cyclophosphamide  CPA  is a general immunosuppressant used to minimize Treg presence during immunotherapy and also oncolytic virotherapy 
CPA may  however  also enhance replication and efficacy of oncolytic viruses by diminishing cytokine secretion by stromal cells  including type I IFN   
Another compound enhancing oncolytic virus efficacy by lowering cell responsiveness to type I IFN is triptolide  which acts downstream of IRF  activation   
Further  the kinase mammalian target of rapamycin  mTOR  enhances the antiviral effects of type I IFN by activation of its effector proteins  E BP  which binds and inactivates translation factor eIF E  and S K  which carries out cell type specific signaling functions of type I IFN  such as activation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor  B and promotion of ISG  transcription 
Consequently  rapamycin was able to enhance oncolytic VSV replication and anti tumor efficacy by inhibiting type I IFN mediated antiviral signaling via mTOR   Several other compounds synergizing with oncolytic viruses have been identified via high throughput drug library screening  many of which seem to act by antagonizing antiviral defenses 
For instance  a novel virus sensitizer  Vse  was found to greatly diminish antiviral effects of type I IFN against oncolytic VSV in several cancer cell types  and the drug also synergized with the virus in subcutaneous mouse tumor models   
For many of these new compounds  the mechanism of action is still poorly understood  necessitating extensive safety studies to exclude undesirable effects against normal cells Apart from classical type I IFN induced antiviral defenses  which typically prevent virus translation and degrade virus genomes  other cellular machineries regulate oncolytic virus efficacy 
Notably  strategies to increase cancer cell death in response to oncolytic viruses have been tested 
In a recent study  a class of compounds called SMAC mimetics synergized in several cancer models with oncolytic VSV by removing cancer cell block to apoptosis in response to virus induced type I IFN  TNF α or TRAIL   
Interestingly  since virus infection triggered cytokines act on nearby non infected cells  SMAC mimetics may in combination with oncolytic viruses also cause significant bystander tumor destruction 
Normal cells are not affected by the IFN SMAC mimetic synergy  providing an important safety aspect 
In another study  blocking the ER stress response circuitry triggered by oncolytic rhabdovirus infection by a small molecular inhibitor of serine threonine protein kinase and endoribonuclease IRE α  which was identified in a genome wide siRNA screen  greatly enhanced cytotoxicity via caspase induced apoptosis and increased oncolytic efficacy in refractory tumor models in mice   
This effect was independent on induction or responsiveness to type I IFN 
Conversely  inhibitors of nucleoside transporter   ENT  were discovered from a high throughput screen of enhancers of oncolytic HSV  and to date such inhibitors have not been reported to alter cellular antiviral responses   
Other compounds  such as common chemotherapeutics  and their mechanisms synergizing with oncolytic viruses have been discussed elsewhere for most of them the possible role of antiviral defense antagonism in enhancing oncolytic virus efficacy remains to be studied   Thus  many compounds are available to interfere with tumor antiviral defenses 
The outstanding question for most of them  however  seems to be why such compounds do not render normal cells sensitive to oncolytic viruses 
Elucidation of the exact mechanisms of action and the differences between normal and cancer cells constitute a worthy goal for studies in the near future Already in the  s it became clear that using certain pathogenic wildtype viruses  such as West Nile virus and Bunyamwera virus  in cancer patients would result in off target toxicity   
Characteristic for pathogenic viruses is a greater ability to circumvent or antagonize cellular innate antiviral defenses than attenuated strains 
For example  unlike the prototypical oncolytic reovirus strain type   Dearing  the T L strain of reovirus causes accumulation of IRF  in the nucleus and inhibits activation of a select group of ISGs yet because of this property the T L strain is myocarditic unlike the oncolytic type   Dearing strain   
For these reasons  many oncolytic viruses used today  such as reovirus type   Dearing  oncolytic strains of Newcastle disease virus and M mutated VSV have either a stronger capacity to induce or a weaker capacity to resist antiviral type I IFN than the corresponding wildtype strains   An open question  however  is whether strain specific or virus specific differences that relate to specific components of the cellular antiviral machinery may be exploited for greater anti tumor efficacy  i e  if one virus fails  could another be used in its stead 
While Ras expression was critical for oncolytic reovirus replication in cells overexpressing CUG  oncogene  oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus was unable to replicate in the same cells due to increased activation of STAT  and OASL    
Thus  in these cells reovirus was not affected by STAT  or OASL  and it therefore remains interesting to see which other antiviral effectors may have been lacking in the CUG expressing cells and  conversely  how reovirus and VSV differ in terms of sensitivity to antiviral effectors 
While several oncolytic viruses have been compared to each other in terms of replication rate and cytotoxicity  systematic studies with regard to tumor antiviral defenses have not been conducted As any attenuated virus is likely to replicate effectively only in its own niche  i e  to be restricted by a specific set of ISGs  and as wild type strains may be too toxic for use in humans  a compromise may be achieved by incorporating select elements from wild type viruses into oncolytic virus backbones 
Indeed  several chimeric and recombinant viruses have been generated that harbor specific elements of wild type strains or even of other unrelated viruses in order to better resist cancer antiviral defenses  Table  
As an example of introducing wild type elements into attenuated viruses  Haralambieva reported on a measles virus Edmonston vaccine strain in which P gene was replaced with the counterpart from the wild type IC B strain   
Later  Meng et al 
included N  P  and L genes from wild type measles in Edmonston backbone  producing an enhanced but still safe oncolytic virus   
Edmonston vaccine virus induces a more robust IFN response compared to wild type measles virus partly due to the weaker ability of V protein to suppress MDA mediated activation of IRF  and IFN I induction   
In vivo  P gene encoded proteins  particularly V  control the quality of the cytokine response to measles so that vaccine strains qualitatively induce a stronger inflammatory response compared to WT strains  where WT V protein suppresses multiple cytokine secretion 
V protein short cytoplasmic tail has been shown to bind and inactivate STAT  IRF  MDA  and the Rel homology domain of the NfκB subunit p  but not of p    
Also  V causes LGP  protein to bind and inactivate RIG I    but it seemingly does not interfere with TICAM   TRIF  multiple TLR adaptor  including TLR mediated IFN β induction 
Thus  if cancer and normal cells would differ with regard to TICAM  or IRF  then such a virus could potentially target specifically cancer cells rather than normal cells 
So far  the measles Edmonston WT chimeras have proven safe in animals As an example of heterologous virus constructs  lentogenic Newcastle disease virus engineered to express influenza virus PR   H N  NS  showed enhanced oncolytic efficacy in vivo due to dampening of antiviral responses   
While such a virus did not display enhanced pathogenicity in that study  a mesogenic NDV virus harboring NS  from influenza strain H N  did show increased pathogenicity in chickens as well as an increased ability to replicate in human cells    raising some cautionary warnings for future engineering of similar replicative viruses 
As another example  vaccinia virus soluble type I IFN scavenger B R  NOTE  B R is often used in the literature  has been engineered into both oncolytic HSV and oncolytic rhabdoviruses  resulting in all cases in more effective therapy agents without loss of tumor specificity   
Oncolytic γ  gene deleted HSV was complemented by two different PKR antagonists from human cytomegalovirus  TRS  and IRS  generating a chimera capable of reaching wild type virus replication levels in cancer cells in vitro and in tumor models in vivo   The selection of various viral IFN I antagonists that potentially could be used to augment attenuated oncolytic viruses is vast   
For example  increased replication of several viruses  including HIV  Sindbis virus and E deleted adenovirus in mammalian cells was observed when the cells were engineered to express vaccinia virus E L protein  influenza A virus NS  protein  ebola virus VP  protein or HIV  Tat protein   
The choice of antagonist must primarily be made with safety in mind  but virus specific and cell specific differences in antagonist functions may potentially be exploited rationally when considering the overall combination 
For example  vaccinia virus E L is able to rescue VSV but not EMCV from exogenous IFN  whereas vaccinia virus K L partially rescued EMCV but not VSV   In anticipation of systematic  perhaps bioinformatically guided   super chimera  studies  two or more viruses that may complement each other s shortcomings in antiviral defense antagonism have been considered 
Notably  vaccinia virus was favorably combined with IFN I sensitive oncolytic VSV and SFV  yielding tumor model dependent increases in overall therapy efficacy that were dependent on vaccinia virus antagonism of type I IFN responses  which increased the replication of the IFN sensitive viruses   
Such heterologous virotherapy approaches may also be used to generate immunological synergy  similar to heterologous prime boost vaccination  anti tumor immune responses may be increased due to targeting of the tumor by two different viruses  on two separate occasions  but anti virus immune responses would be generated against different viruses each time  avoiding the problem of neutralizing immunity to and predominance of antivirus immune responses   
Some other ideas explored experimentally include engineering oncolytic viruses to express other oncolytic viruses 
For example  the entire oncolytic parvovirus H  genome was placed under a regulatable promoter in oncolytic adenovirus  resulting in a more effective therapeutic entity than either virus alone without loss of tumor specificity   
The genetic material of Semliki Forest virus replicons has been engineered into adenovirus and vaccinia virus backbones   and several other virus chimeras have been constructed   
However  the effects on tumor antiviral defenses of such a constructs remain to be studied The attribute  oncolytic  implies for a virus that it infects and  indeed  lyses the infected tumor 
This property is primarily tested in vitro in cultured tumor cells 
We have learned  however  that in the native tumor microenvironment in living hosts many viruses are no longer able to infect tumor cells or to kill them even if they manage to infect them 
Tightly packed tumor cells and the network of supportive molecules of the extracellular matrix form a physical barrier to virus particle diffusion 
It has also become evident that the tumor cells themselves may be much more capable of thwarting oncolytic virus advances than previously thought  with some tumor cells residing in a seemingly permanent non permissive antiviral state 
Tumors harbor multiple cell types in addition to the neoplastic cells  which may promote and propagate both physical and cellular virus resistance 
As the efficacy of virotherapy in human cancer patients still falls shy of the achievements in animal models  it appears quite plausible that one or more of the barriers described in this review indeed constitute a real and formidable obstacle for oncolytic virus advancement into routine clinical use 
Fortunately  some of the most difficult barriers have been identified  and a rapidly expanding arsenal of countermeasures is at our disposal 
Our task is now to separate the wheat from the chaff and to systematically evaluate the proposed combination regimens that will yield the best results without compromising patient safety Evidence of prenatal toxicity of herbal based indigenous formulations for sex selection in rat modelsTraditional or indigenous preparations  IPs  are getting considerable attention in global health debates  It continues to be used widely in several countries and its consumption is rapidly increasing 
 
  Many reports have documented the use of such preparations 
For instance  in China  traditional herbal medicines played a critical role during the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome  SARS  In fact  many drugs in modern medicine had their roots in the traditional system of medicine 
Drugs like Penicillin  from Penicillium fungi  and Digoxin  from Digitalis purpurea  are some such examples 
One of the promising therapies for Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus  MRSA  infection is a ninth century treatment for eye infections which is a recipe consisting of garlic and onions  wine  and bile from a cow s stomach brewed in a brass cauldron 
It is however important to note that culture specific practices are not always safe 
Digitalis is a classic example where herbalists use this plant in allopathic treatment strategies  while in some countries such as Britain  law restricts their vast availability  A report from Australia describes the adverse effects of ‘herbal  preparations or IPs  Problems arise when people do not report about the consumption of such preparations assuming that these are devoid of any side effects by virtue of them being natural products  The need for research in this field is huge and scientific research into the quality  safety  molecular effects and clinical efficacy is crucial 
 
 
Pregnancy is considered a time of minimal intervention  and a period when herbal medicines are usually contraindicated  It is reported that many women consume indigenous medicines  that contains Bryonia laciniosa  Quercus infectoria and Putranjiva roxburghii along with other ingredients  during early pregnancy to beget a male child in India 
These preparations  often called sex selection drugs  SSD  contain herbal ingredients but these are off the label prescriptions and hence cannot be certified as ‘herbal  medicines 
The prevalence of consumption varies from   to as high as         Studies have indicated that there is  –  times higher risk of birth defects including major malformations of internal organs like urogenital and renal malformation  trachea esophageal fistula  and visible defects like spina bifida  cleft lip palate and imperforate anus 
 
  Risk of stillbirths also increases   folds 
Studies suggest that a single exposure during pregnancy can be deleterious 
 
 
 
  SSDs are reported to contain phytoestrogens  steroids and heavy metals 
 
 
 
  It is also known that although placenta serves as a barrier  most drugs and environmental chemicals enter the foetal circulation by passive diffusion or active transport  However  despite growing evidence on deleterious effects of these herbal formulations  few studies have attempted to systematically understand the risk of such preparations using animal models 
Genetic sex of a child is determined at the time of conception by the fertilization of the ovum with X or Y sperms and intake of so called preparations for sex selection can never alter that In view of these  the current study was conducted with an objective to determine the embryo foetal and development toxicity of SSDs following maternal exposure during critical period of organogenesis using a small animal model The study was guided by the OECD guidelines for testing of chemicals  Guideline no    adopted on  nd January   Prenatal Developmental Toxicity Study  and was based on a mutually approved protocol 
Personal protection equipment was employed as required while handling the test system The test facility is registered and renewed  No 
 PO RcBi S CPCSEA dated July     for breeding and to conduct research on animals for commercial purpose by the committee for the purpose of control and supervision of experiments on animals  CPCSEA  Ministry of Environment  Forests and Climate Change  Government of India 
The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee  Venus Medicine Research Center 
Due permission was taken from the Ethics Committee of Indian Institute of Public Health Delhi For this experiment  strain of Sprague Dawley of rats  Rattus norvegicus  was used 
The number of dams per group was   instead of   as laid down under OECD guidelines 
Rats of both sexes  –  g  were obtained from National Institute of Biologicals  India at  –  weeks of age  acclimatized for five days and then subjected to the experiment at  –  weeks of age 
They were housed in standard polypropylene rat cages with stainless steel top grill  one dam per cage  at a temperature of       °C  with  –  relative humidity 
Bedding material and cages were changed once in six days and   hourly light dark cycle was followed 
Animals were identified by their existing ear numbering 
Cages were labelled by tags indicating the study number  sex  group of the animals  experimental start and completion dates 
Standard pelleted feed  from Ashirwad Industries  Mohali  India  was provided ad libitum to all the animals 
They also had free access to purified water via drinking bottles throughout the study 
The feed  cages and drinking bottles were not analysed for the presence of phytoestrogens and bisphenol A 
However  similar materials were used for all the rats across all groups The drug comprised of IPs for sex selection  SSD 
These non branded locally made preparations are made available  –  days after placing an order and are never sold openly 
These preparations essentially contain herbal ingredients such as Shivlingi  Bryonia laciniosa  Majuphal  Quercus infectoria  Putrajeevak  Putranjiva roxburghii  Nagkesar  Mesua ferrea  and feather of peacock  Pavo cristatus 
A total of   such samples of SSDs were procured from varied sources like ‘pansari  shop owners  grocers  local alternative medicine practitioners  rickshaw pullers  drivers and commoners from different states 
SSDs are advised to be consumed between   and   weeks of pregnancy The samples were categorized into   groups based on redundancy of the preparations and common ingredients reported 
This was followed by chemical analysis in an accredited laboratory to detect the presence of phytoestrogens and steroids 
Since we explored the toxic effects of these preparations we wanted to select two samples that would be most predictive of toxicity 
Due to resource constraints  we did not want to subject all the   samples for animal study 
Hence  three samples of SSDs  found to be most rich in phenols and steroids were selected for toxicity study  All the three samples were also tested for heavy metals which suggested that Lead and Mercury were in very high quantities  The toxicity was examined using C  elegans  an alternate animal model 
Survival analysis and reproductive toxicity was assessed from the brood size and progeny count assay  The two SSDs that were found to be most toxic were selected as test items for the subsequent study in rat models 
SSD   was reported to contain Shivlingi and Putrajeevak while SSD   contained Shivlingi  Majuphal  Putrajeevak  Nagkesar and feathers of peacock 
Both the samples were obtained from grocers 
Local preparations like these are bound to have certain degree of variability in concentrations but more often than not  these remain the major ingredients According to studies reported  women consume such preparations along with cow s milk in dosages and schedule that are quite varied 
While some advise these IPs to be consumed for one day  others prescribe it for   days  to be taken thrice a day 
We considered the amount of SSDs most commonly reported by pregnant women  weighing   kg  which was  –  g daily for   days 
The dose of the test item   mg kg  was calculated by using conversion factor of  Conversion factor is the ratio of the correction factors  estimated by dividing the average body weight in kgs of species by the body surface area in m  of the species  Km 
Human equivalent dose  HED in mg kg    Animal dose  mg kg  X correction factor  Km animal Km human 
Kms of every species are constant 
For humans it is    assuming average weight of adults to be   kg a surface area of   m  and for rats it is  Therefore  HED   mg  kg    animal dose X  
Or  animal dose         mg kg           mg kg Since pregnant women consume these orally  these were administered to rats by oral route The test items were coded as SSD   and SSD   and were provided to the experimental laboratory  Venus Medicine Research Center  Baddi  in powder form 
On the day of dosing  the doses were administered between  –  h  The test items were administered in fresh cow s milk at a final volume of   ml kg 
The doses were calculated on the basis of the latest body weight recorded for the study 
A stainless steel gavage cannula fitted to a calibrated syringe was used for dosing the animals For control animals  cow s milk was used as a vehicle while feeding The study was performed in two phases to evaluate the effect of SSD consumption duration during gestation period Adult  nulliparous female rats were mated with males of same species and strain in  
Each morning  dams were examined for the presence of a vaginal plug and vaginal smear was taken from each dam by using pipette smear technique 
The day of vaginal plug formation or sperms observed in vaginal smear  also known as successful mating  were considered as GD   Gestation day  
The mated females were housed individually in clear polycarbonate cages with stainless steel wire lids 
Mating process was carried out to result in   pregnant animals per group 
Successfully mated females were randomized into control and treatment groups 
All the rats were sacrificed on GD  
According to OECD guidelines  the test chemical should be administered daily from implantation to the day prior to scheduled caesarean section in order to assess toxicity 
Test chemicals were administered to pregnant animals and sacrificed as per the schedule  which was as close as possible to the normal day of delivery without risking loss of data resulting from early delivery i e GD  
The females were killed  before caesarean section  the uterine contents were examined  and the fetuses were evaluated for soft tissue and skeletal changes The pregnant rats were randomized to two intervention and one control groups 
SSD was given during pre implantation to implantation stage  GD  – 
Each group of rats was treated either with vehicle  G  VC  SSD   G    mg kg  or SSD   G    mg kg SSDs were given from GD  – 
Each group of rats was treated with either vehicle or SSD  or SSD 
Allocation of animals was randomized to the following groups  G   Control  VC  G   SSD    mg kg  G   SSD    mg kg  G   SSD    mg kg  G   SSD    mg kg  G SSD    mg kg  G   SSD    mg kg The following parameters were observed •Clinical Signs  Animals were observed once after successful mating or on GD  and after administration of the first dose 
Cage side observations for clinical signs of toxicity in the animals were recorded once daily until the day before necropsy •Body weight  Body weight of all experimental animals were recorded once before mating  initial body weight  and then after confirmation of mating 
Body weights were recorded on days               and on terminal day before sacrifice 
These recorded body weights were used for calculating the dose volume to be administered •Food consumption  Food consumption was evaluated once after successful mating or on day   of gestation  the day of vaginal plug formation or sperms observed in vaginal smear  and on days             and one day prior to sacrifice 
Calculated amount of feed were placed in the trough of each cage and the quantity of feed remaining after approximately   h were weighed and recorded •Morbidity Mortality  All the animals were observed twice daily  once in the morning between   and   h and once in the evening between   and   h  for incidence of morbidity and or mortality •Maternal examination related parameters  At the end of the observation period  all the dams were sequentially euthanized  by CO  asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation  and subjected to gross necropsy 
After termination  dams were examined macroscopically for any structural abnormalities or pathological changes 
Blinding was done while evaluation of the dams during caesarean section and subsequent foetal analyses to minimize bias 
Pregnancy rate was calculated as the proportion of mated pairs that had produced at least one pregnancy within a fixed period where pregnancy was determined by the earliest available evidence that fertilization has occurred 
Gestation index was calculated to indicate number of females with live born as a proportion of number of females with evidence of pregnancy •Examination of uterine contents  Immediately after termination  the uteri were removed and the pregnancy status of the animals ascertained 
Gravid uteri including the cervix were weighed  and number of corpora lutea were determined 
The uterine contents were examined for numbers of embryonic or foetal deaths and live foetuses 
The degree of resorption was described in order to estimate the relative time of death of the conceptus 
Any increase in the number of resorption and or implantation loss is an indicator of litter size for the individual dam •Examination of foetuses  The sex and weight of each foetus were determined 
Approximately one half of each litter were prepared and examined for skeletal alterations from selected dams 
The remainder were prepared and examined for soft tissue alterations  using accepted or appropriate serial sectioning methods or careful gross dissection techniques 
Each foetus was examined for external alterations 
Foetuses were examined for skeletal alterations  using Alizarin Red S staining method 
The fetuses for skeletal staining were kept in pre labelled plastic containers containing   ethanol before staining 
After skinning  we processed the foetus for staining by immersing in   alcian blue   GX for three days  then performed rehydration through a gradient series of ethanol   ethanol   –  h twice    ethanol   –  h  ethanol   –  h  distilled water until the samples sank to the bottom of a conical tube 
Samples were further treated with   KOH for  –  days or until it became clear and again treated with   alizarin red for next  –  days until bones became purple 
Samples were rinsed   times in   KOH  for  –  h at each time point 
Samples were further treated with a gradient series of glycerol  KOH    h   glycerol   h X  Visceral examination was done by micro dissection technique 
Fetuses were preserved in   formalin until they became fixed 
An illuminated magnifier was used for visceral examination 
We placed the foetus in a supine position on a paraffin wax block tray covered with paraffin wax  secured the fetal limbs by paper pins to the paraffin wax block  made a ventral midline incision from the umbilicus  cutting caudally to the genital tubercle and cranially to the diaphragm 
Once incision was completed  we located the ventral attachment of the diaphragm and lifted the liver carefully to examine the diaphragm for abnormal opening 
After observation  the diaphragm was clipped 
We gave a longitudinal cut to open the rib cage slightly lateral to and on the right of the sternebrae and then extended the cut anteriorly to neck region 
The rib cage was opened gently and secured to the paraffin block petridish tray with pins Foetuses were examined for soft tissue alterations  e g 
variations and malformations or anomalies  using Wilson s Technique 
The fetal viscera were examined sequentially  beginning with thoracic organs and moving caudally 
We performed hearts cuts after completion of other observations 
We examined the bilobed thymus for size  shape  coloration and presence of haemorrhages and then removed it for observation of trachea and esophagus 
We observed the lungs for size  color and number of lobes  observed the trachea  esophagus for normal alignment and presence of fistula  opened the pericardial sac and cut off pericardium to expose the heart for observation 
We checked the size  shape  color of the heart and normal development of major blood vessels 
After observation of thoracic viscera  we observed the abdominal viscera and liver for size  shape  color  texture  and number of lobes 
External anatomy of heart was examined by making two incisions using micro dissecting scissors We examined the stomach  spleen  pancreas  small and large intestines for size  position or any other developmental anomalies 
The intestines were moved aside after observation for seeing the underlying structures 
Ureters were checked for normal size and location and for continuity from the renal hilus to the urinary bladder 
One kidney was cut transversely and another was longitudinally to examine renal papilla and renal pelvis 
To confirm the sex of the foetus  the gonads were inspected carefully 
We examined the reproductive organs for size  shape and location GraphPad Prism® statistical software version   was used to analyze the data and all the results were represented as mean   S E M 
Intergroup variance for most of the parameters was calculated by one way analysis of variance  ANOVA  followed by Tukey s test 
A value of p     was regarded statistically significant 
Linear regression was performed to examine the weight change of dams during pregnancy for each group comparing with the control after adjusting for the litter size 
The malformations were analysed by performing Chi square test for trend for two groups  SSD  G  G  G  G  and SSD  G  G  G  G The ARRIVE guidelines were followed to report the findings 
In phase   pre natal study  all the dams dosed with SSD  and SSD  had normal food intake and weight gain 
The average gain in weight from GD  to GD   was       gms for controls while it was       gms in SSD   and       gms in SSD 
 Webtable  
No test item related mortality or clinical sign of toxicity was encountered during the study 
All dams in treatment groups and control group survived to scheduled terminal sacrifice 
They showed normal behaviour until euthanized 
There were no differences in mean maternal body weights  body weight gains  pregnancy rate  gestational index  pre and post implantation loss  and resorptions 
No significant differences were observed in foetal sex ratio  foetal body weights 
However  one dam from SSD  had all male foetuses 
No abnormality was detected in skeletal and visceral examination In phase   controls and SSD  and SSD  treated dams exhibited a comparable food intake  Table  
 
However  a dose response relationship was observed with reduced weight gain with higher doses of SSDs 
 Table  
 
Two dams  one in G   SSD    mg kg  and the other in G   SSD    mg kg  categories showed decreased or consistent body weight GD  onwards 
On an average  the weight on GD   was       gms in controls while it was       with SSD    mg kg  and       gms with SSD    mg kg 
The adjusted analysis indicated that except in G  there was a significant reduction in weight gain in all the intervention groups as compared to the control group after controlling for litter size  Table  
 During follow up  one dam from SSD    mg kg  and one from SSD    mg kg  showed haematuria during gestational day  – 
However  no another clinical sign of toxicity was encountered during the study 
All the dams in treatment and control groups showed normal behaviour and survived to scheduled terminal sacrifice 
In phase   pregnancy rate and gestational index were found to be   at all dose levels with SSD  whereas  in SSD  it decreased to   in G   SSD    mg kg  and G   SSD    mg kg  groups 
One dam from G   SSD    mg kg  and another one from G   SSD    mg kg  group showed mating confirmation during vaginal smear examination and showed positive sign in initial days of pregnancy but during necropsy on expected day of delivery  GD   no foetus was found 
Body weights of dams increased in the initial stages that became constant at a later period 
To reconfirm it  non gravid uterus was stained in salewski strain and presence of conceptus was found 
This indicated the possibility of miscarriage Increased pre and post implantation losses as well as resorptions and reduced live foetuses were observed with both SSD  and SSD 
No significant differences were observed in foetal sex ratio  but decreased foetal body weights were noted in both sexes 
On an average one early resorption in a group was a normal observation 
More than one late resorption was observed in all treatment groups while there was none in the control group 
Total count of live foetuses count was significantly reduced with SSD  and SSD  treatment in a dose dependent manner 
Total number of live foetuses were reduced up to   in SSD  at   mg kg treatment group and   in SSD  at   mg kg treatment group Both SSD  and SSD s at different dose levels showed decreased fetal weight in dose dependent manner  although the difference was not significant 
Skeletal and soft tissue alterations were observed in both treatment groups 
In general  the embryo–foetal examination showed abnormalities  which could have caused some functional damage to these foetuses if allowed to grow in the normal course 
In visceral examinations  slight dilation of the renal pelvis  reduced papilla size  urinary bladder hypertrophy was observed in few foetuses from both SSD  and SSD  treatment groups 
Few incidences of foetal soft tissue abnormalities encountered in this study were normal variants 
Skeletal examination showed variations in the ossification patterns like incomplete or poorly ossified skulls  ossification of sternebra  cleavage ossification of thoracic centrum  asymmetric thoracic centrum  and supernumerary rib in many foetuses in SSD  and SSD  groups  Table  
 
A trend was noted with increased incidence of certain malformations with increasing dosages of SSDs that was statistically significant for most malformations with SSD The results of this developmental toxicity study suggest that administration of SSDs to pregnant rats had significant impact on intrauterine foetal growth  early and late resorption as well as developmental anomalies 
These formulations have teratogenic potential but does not affect sex ratio IPs contain phytoestrogens like diadzein and genistein  In vitro rat whole embryo culture assay  WEC  studies of genistein in rats have indicated fetotoxic and teratogenic potential at concentration of ≥  μg mL  However  in vivo  an oral  gavage  embryonic and fetal development pilot study could not demonstrate any teratogenic effect in the same study 
These findings are different from our study probably because we used SSDs containing natural herbal and non herbal ingredients unlike those studies where synthetic genistein was used 
In both the studies  decreased body weight was observed indicating slight maternal toxicity 
Food consumption was unaffected in our study which is contrary to what was reported 
In another study  pregnant rats exposed to oral isoflavones  diadzein and genistein in varying combinations  showed alterations in the number of live foetuses  lysed foetuses  number of resorption sites  and implantation sites while no clinical signs suggestive of maternal toxicity  seizures  tremors and salivation  that was observed similar to our study 
Maternal mass gain was significantly reduced in rats treated with   mg kg of isoflavones  Ratio of females to males in the litter of different groups was similar akin to our finding  These observations clearly nullify the claim that consumption of SDDs could alter the sex of the growing foetus 
An analysis done by the same authors earlier revealed that SSDs contain testosterone and steroids 
 
  The prenatal testosterone in pregnancy is known to affect sexual development adversely      The principles of reproductive biology state that the genetic sex of an individual is determined at the time of conception and can never be altered under any circumstances 
However  phenotypic sex of the growing foetus is likely to be influenced by the hormonal milieu of in utero environment 
Our analysis was confined to phenotypic sex only and hence it is difficult to state if any differences existed with reference to genetic and phenotypic sex 
This requires further inquiry Evidence on the effects of SSDs on humans should best be obtained from human beings 
The findings of the current study corroborate well with the evidence generated from observational studies in human beings      Presence of skeletal and visceral malformations could explain why stillbirths are likely to be more in women who consume SSDs 
The dosing of the test drugs was intended not only to examine the period of organogenesis solely but to assess effects from preimplantation  through the entire period of gestation to the day before caesarean section 
The results were based on observations of more than   female animals with implantation sites at necropsy that added to its strength 
Unnecessary handling of pregnant animals as well as any stressors from outside was avoided 
At least three dose levels and a concurrent vehicle control were used with dams randomly allocated to different treatment groups that support the validity of the results 
However  absence of   rats per group does not support it to be a fully OECD compliant study 
We did follow the principles of Good Laboratory Practices  GLP  but due to constraints of resources the study could not be conducted as a GLP compliant study  though this is optimal for academic interests There is a lack of systematic approach to assess the safety and effectiveness of herbal preparations 
Ingredients for herbal medicines are often drawn from different sources and are used in combination  which may exhibit variability in terms of species  growing conditions  and biologically active constituents 
To isolate each active ingredient from each herb and then to establish its toxicity is time consuming  resource intensive and not practical 
Moreover  drug approval process does not accommodate undifferentiated mixtures  Though important  it surpasses the herb herb interaction and the potentiating effect of one compound over another 
Therefore  in our study  we administered the herbal mixture to assess the effects 
Real time evaluations have yielded important observations for several herbal drugs especially related to pregnancy 
For instance  Wang et al 
  used mice model to evaluate the adverse pregnancy outcomes after maternal exposure to the herbal medicines  particularly during early pregnancy  The major events included maternal and perinatal mortality 
Maternal weight gain  embryo growth and post natal weight gain were significantly decreased 
Moreover  foetal resorption and skeletal malformations were increased  signifying potential toxicity of Chinese herbal medicines 
This is comparable to our findings To conclude  the results of this developmental toxicity study suggest that administration of SSD  and SSD  to pregnant rats exerted significant impact on intrauterine foetal growth and development without any effect on sex ratio when administered during the period of organogenesis 
The prenatal exposure of SSD  and SSD  at dosage level of   mg kg day and   mg kg day during gestational days  –  to female rats had demonstrable effect on maternal or embryo foetal toxicity and teratogenicity SBN and AG conceptualized the study  AS and DD developed the study protocol and conducted the experiment  analysed the data and interpreted the findings

It is therefore natural to expect that the distribution of amino acids  across all protein sequences  would appear to be fixed  given no mutations over a specific period of time 
Of the   naturally occurring amino acids  each seems to appear randomly located at a particular position within the sequence of a protein 
However  when the sequences of a group of proteins are compared to one another  specific patterns begin to emerge 
These patterns are commonly referred to as motifs and frequently produce similar structural elements and in many cases  similar functions between the proteins that contain them 
In recent years  significant efforts have been made to reduce sequences into discrete motifs  so that each can be linked to some specific biological function based on particular rules      
Databases that consist of identifiable amino acid motifs  such as PROSITE  Pratt and EMOTIF  have been constructed to allow researchers an easy classification of unknown proteins into families based on their common motifs               
All of these methods share one property  they depend on specific alignment algorithms  such as the basic local alignment search tool  BLAST or PSI BLAST  to perform the sequence comparison between diverse families of proteins being analyzed      
These methods have already led to a number of key discoveries and offer the promise of determining biologically meaningful information about function from a protein s primary sequence It is generally accepted that a strong correlation exists between a protein s amino acid sequence and its resulting structure and function         
Techniques that can quickly determine significant similarities between protein sequences are valuable in predicting an unknown protein s function within the cell 
Here we describe a procedure that  by computing the frequency of key amino acid pairs  can quickly classify large groups of proteins into functional groups 
In order to uncover any relevant amino acid strings  we have utilized statistical methods applicable to datasets with large fluctuations in the search of human protein sequences within both the Swiss Prot and Complete Human Genebank databases The goal of this manuscript is to demonstrate how these two residue motifs can be used to develop rapid methods for searching protein or genomic databases in order to locate potentially interesting or aberrant protein sequences 
As an example  we describe the distribution of select amino acid pairs within the genome of the Coronavirus  Tor  which is responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome  SARS    
We have examined additional sets  but the limited format of this paper precludes a large presentation of potential applications The set of all   naturally occurring  amino acids are described by their standard single letter representations  and are taken as the complete set contained within all protein sequences as shown below Zq A R N D C Q E G H I L K M F P S T W Y V Residues that are arranged in a certain order can be referred to as vectors and are represented symbolically as b n b b bn bj Zq The coordinates of each vector represent the amino acid symbols contained within any given protein  where n is the total length of the vector 
The collection of all vectors b n  in the proteome can therefore be denoted simply by Zq n The underlying structure of a protein sequence  which is the order of the amino acids  has unique and identifiable characteristics 
As an analogy  in written English  the letter q is almost always followed by u 
Also  the frequency of the word  and  is much higher than that of the related three letter strings   nad   nda   dan  and  dna  which are simply permutations of the same set of individual letters to construct a word with a different meaning 
Utilizing similar characteristics  we can intuitively scan for unique sequence vectors contained within any given protein 
We expand on these characteristics  by utilizing the concepts of affinity and order stability in Section  Using the entire Swiss Prot database  release number   as the basis for our calculations  we have constructed a probability table for the occurrence of the   naturally occurring amino acids  see Table  
    
In addition to the Swiss Prot database  we have also included data from Complete Human Genebank  NCBI Build Number   March    as a source for all characterized and hypothetical human protein sequences We use the symbol Ω to denote the Swiss Prot database  and the letter M to denote the number of proteins in the database  
Hence we can state that Ω As s M  where As a a as Ns  is the sth protein  ai with i Zq is the ith amino acid in the sequence  and Ns is the length of the protein sequence As 
For any vector b n  if there is a sequence As in Ω such that b n  is a segment of As  then we can say b n  occurs in Ω 
We can then use NΩ b n  to denote the total number of outcomes that b n  has occurred in Ω  and let NΩ n  be the total number of all vectors occurring in Ω with length n  Therefore p b n NΩ b n NΩ n is the probability that the vector b n  occurs in Ω 
We then introduce k p q b n log p b n q b n where p b n  and q b n  are any two probability distributions on Zq n  and b n  belongs to Zq n 
The quantity k p q b n  in Eq 
  is defined for any two probability distributions p b n  and q b n  on Zq n  where the distribution q arises from independent letter  i e  amino acid  probabilities 
Then  k p q b n  can be viewed as a random variable about b n  and its probability distribution is defined as follows F p q x PI k p q b n ⩽x b n k p q b n ⩽xp b n The expectation value μ p q  and variance σ p q  of p b n  are expressed mathematically as μ p q b n Zq n p b n k p q b n 
 σ p q b n Zq n p b n k p q b n μ p q  Hence we see that μ p q  is simply the Kullback–Leibler entropy   
As a consequence  μ p q  is always non negative and μ p q  if and only if p b n q b n 
As a result  the amino acid sequence of b n  can be represented by k p q b n In Eq 
  the probability distributions p  q in the k p q b n  have several possible values 
For example  if we let p be the probability of b n  and only change the value of q in k p q b n  we obtain the following expression q b n j np bj p b p b p bn Based on Eqs 
  and   the value of k p q b n  gives us the affinity for all amino acids within vector b n 
Here two situations are identified as especially interesting i When k p q b n  implies that among the amino acids in vector b n  there is an increased affinity 
That is  the vector b n  occurs more frequently than expected 
 ii When k p q b n  implies that among the amino acids in vector b n  there is a decreased affinity 
That is  the vector b n  occurs less frequently than expected In a similar approach to the condition described above  we may choose q b n p πn b n  where πn b n  is a permutation of b n  and πn denotes a permutation transform 
In this case  the order sensitivity of b n  can also be reflected by the value of k p q b n  and produces the following outcomes i when k p q b n  implies that b n  occurs much more often than πn b n ii when k p q b n  implies that πn b n  occurs much more often than b n In addition to the concepts of affinity and order sensitivity  we can also design other analysis techniques by choosing alternate representations of q b n 
Quantifying the terms k p q b n  we can represent vector frequency numerically 
In cases where k p q b n μ p q ⩾ σ p q  the corresponding vector b n  is called  positive  while in those cases where the opposite takes place  k p q b n μ p q ⩽ σ p q  the vector b n  is called  negative 
By judiciously choosing a   equal to   we obtained   two residue  positive pairs  and   two residue negative pairs  see Table  
  out of a total of   possibilities of amino acid pairs Using any one of the positive motifs from Table   we can develop a test method to detect changes in their distribution through any protein database 
If b b b  is  positive  then p b b μ σp b p b  where p ⋅  is the probability of the amino acids or vectors ⋅ in the database 
Since NΩ μ M Nμ p bj NΩ bj μ MNμ we have NΩ b μ M Nμ μ MNμ μ σp b NΩ b or NΩ b μ M Nμ μ MNμ μ σp b NΩ b and since μ M Nμ is very close to μ MNμfor Swiss Prot database we have NΩ b μ σp b NΩ b and NΩ b μ σp b NΩ b As a consequence of Eq 
  the detection of a deleterious mutation based on the increased appearance of an arbitrary string of these residues becomes possible 
For example  according to Table   CC is an attractive motif with   then NΩ CC μ σp C μ M Nμ μ MNμNΩ C ≈ μ σp C NΩ C Let Ns CC  and Ns C  be the number of CC and the number of C in the sth protein 
Then we have NΩ CC NΩ C  because μ σ  and p C  since NΩ CC s MNs CC NΩ C s MNs C Based upon the result that the CC pair represents a rare event  proteins satisfying Ns CC Ns C  as defined in Eq 
  suddenly become interesting 
We can therefore consider the number Ns CC  as an index to develop detection methods to test for the presence of a CC containing protein within a database 
Using this same reasoning  one can also use any other one of the remaining motifs in Table   to develop detection methods for additional proteins In an identical fashion to the previous example using the positive two residue motifs in Table   we can also use any of the  negative  two residue motifs to develop search methods 
For example  the CM pair is a  negative  two residue  word  with  
That is  p CM μ σp C p M 
Using identical arguments to those described in Section   we obtain NΩ CM NΩ M  and NΩ CM NΩ C 
Since both Ns M  and Ns C  are small numbers for fixed proteins  the overall number of CM pairs in most proteins should be close to zero 
Therefore  we can also use any of the remaining seven  negative  motifs in Table   to develop additional detection methods In contrast to the CC motif  the total number of proteins in the Swiss Prot database having more than one CM pair is quite small 
For example  among the   proteins contained within this database  the number of proteins such that Ns CM ⩾  is   and the number of proteins satisfying the condition Ns CM ⩾  is only  
For human proteins in Swiss Prot  the total number of proteins containing CM pairs is   and there are only   proteins that satisfy Ns CM ⩾   Table  
However  we would expect to find about   proteins having CM pairs in the Swiss Prot database  based upon the amino acid frequencies given in Table   which is greater than the number observed Cysteine rich proteins and the presence of CC pairs in proteins are both concepts that have been studied previously      
If we combine these two concepts and describe them in mathematical terms  we observe that the rates q Ns C Ns and q Ns CC Ns C  describe these two conditions  where Ns  Ns C  and Ns CC  are the numbers of all amino acids  cysteine  and CC  respectively 
We can then derive proteinsNs C Ns p C σ Ns CC Ns C p ξτ C ξτ C σ where σ  and σ  are the standard deviations about Ns C Nss Mand Ns CC Ns C s M respectively We have found the following computational results based on Swiss Prot database σ ≈ σ ≈ andp ξτ C ξτ C ⩾ p C For   we have a much simpler method to determine that a protein sequence is both C  and CC rich if proteinsNs C Ns ∩proteinsNs CC Ns C So  a much simpler method to test whether a protein is a both C  and CC rich for   isNumber of CC  Number of C Number of C  Length of protein Using this principle  we found a total of eight proteins that are both C  and CC rich within the Swiss Prot database For   there is an easier method to determine whether a protein sequence is both C  and CC rich if proteinsNs C Ns ∩proteinsNs CC Ns C So  a much simpler method to test whether a protein is both C  and CC rich for   is based on the inequalitiesNumber of CC  Number of C Number of C  Length of protein Using this principle  we can get a total of   proteins that are both C  and CC rich within the entire Swiss Prot database For   there is also an easier method to determine if a protein sequence is both C  and CC rich sequence when proteinsNs C Ns ∩proteinsNs CC Ns C So  a much simpler method to test whether a protein is both C  and CC rich for   is based on the inequalitiesNumber of CC  Number of C Number of C Length of protein Using this principle  we have identified a total of   proteins that are both C  and CC rich within the Swiss Prot database 
From these results  it becomes clear that there are many C rich proteins and many CC rich proteins that are not mutually inclusive 
The sets of both C  and CC rich proteins are only subsets of the set containing all C rich proteins or that containing all CC rich proteins Because the Swiss Prot database is somewhat biased to those proteins that are of interest to researchers  we have decided to examine a database that was  in essence  complete 
For this  we chose the human subset sequences contained within the Complete Human Genebank database 
This was the most complete and readily available source of human genetic sequences and should therefore provide us with an accurate representation of both CC and CM pair distributions 
We observed that the total number of CC pairs within the human subset of sequences contained in Genebank  a total of   proteins  was  
These pairs were contained within a total of   proteins  Table   a number that is substantially larger than the   we obtained from Swiss Prot data  Table  
Since the total number of amino acids in The Complete Human Genebank is   we can easily get the expected number of CC in Complete Human Genebank is   which is much less than this actual value  
The same also holds true for the CM pair  where we would expect to see   CM pairs  but actually observe    Table  
 
This result is surprising but true and shows that there are fundamental difference between the Human and other species in terms of the frequency of CC and CM pairs To create a single CM pair  it is obvious that one needs only a single C  If a protein sequence also contains a CC pair  the total number of cysteines available to create a CM pair has been reduced by a factor of  
Using the cutoff value of four CC pairs as statistically significant  we determined the probability of finding a CM pair within proteins that already contained a CC pair  Table  
Even though both CC and CM can occur in the same protein  the total number of proteins in Genebank that contain both CC and CM pairs is   and these pairs almost always occur at different locations in the sequence 
However  in some rare cases the second C within the CC pair is shared with the first C within the CM pair  giving us a new triplet CCM If we filter the set of proteins described above for redundant entries  we obtain a set of   unique proteins that contain the CCM triplet in the human proteome 
Using the probability distributions obtained from Swiss Prot  we obtained the probability of CCM as  
Since the total of all protein lengths in the Swiss Prot database is   there should be a total of   CCM triplets 
This value is almost identical to the predicted number of CCM of  
This result suggests that the CCM triplet at least in Swiss Prot occurs randomly 
However  we can also analyze the CCM probability using a different approach  putting q CCM p CC p M  into Eq 
 
If CCM occurs randomly  then we have p CCM p C p C p M  and since p CC μ σp C p C  we will get k p q CCM log p CCM q CCM log p C p CC ⩽ μ σ Based on Eq 
  it is clear that the presence of a CC pair strongly excludes M  Therefore  the probability of the CCM triplet should occur less frequently than that of CC or M individually We have obtained the following statistical results with regard to the total number of CC and CM pairs contained in the Swiss Prot database i The total number of these proteins satisfying Ns CC ⩾  is   and   of these are found in humans 
 ii The total number of human proteins in Ω that satisfy Ns CC ⩾  is  
 iii The total number of the proteins in Ω that satisfy Ns CM ⩾  is     of these are found in humans 
 iv The total number of human proteins in Ω that satisfy Ns CM ⩾  is only  
The genome of the SARS associated Coronavirus contains a total of   open reading frames  which code for six characterized and five uncharacterized proteins   
After examining the complete proteome the SARS associated Coronavirus we observed a statistically significant increase in the occurrence of the CC and CM pairs in the SARS associated Coronavirus  genome Of the   putative proteins  four contain either CC or CM pairs 
Two large poly proteins  GI  and GI  contain   CC and   CM pairs  as well as   CC and   CM pairs  respectively 
The putative spike glycoprotein  GI    contains   CC and   CM  while the small envelope protein  GI    contains only   CC pair 
The remaining   proteins  of which two have been identified as a nucleocapsid and matrix protein  contain no CC or CM pairs 
When compared to the occurrence of CC and CM pairs within all human proteins found in the Swiss Prot database  it becomes clear that there is an increased occurrence of these pairs within the SARS associated Coronavirus proteome It is clear that the frequency of CC and CM pairs is significantly higher in the SARS genome than it is in the human genome 
It is our hope that these unique two residue motifs could be used as a means of identifying a virus such as SARS 
While currently impossible to determine  one can see a possible clinical use for determining the frequency of CC or CM pairs in an individual 
If a person has been infected by SARS  we would expect the numbers of CC and CM pairs to be much higher than in a healthy individual 
If we were then able to develop a clinically feasible technique that could identify the CC or CM pair content in total cellular protein  without damaging the cell  it could be possible to implement a detection method simply by counting the numbers of CC or CM pairs in all proteins examined 
If the presence of increased CC or CM pairs was indicative of infection by SARS we could develop new drugs to inhibit the translation of proteins that contain these pairs within infected cells 
As a very specific example  this could be accomplished through the use of specific tRNA mimics that could block translating ribosome when these pairs appear at the P and A site simultaneously      
While tRNA mimics could normally be seen as non specific protein synthesis inhibitors  the lower frequency of the CC or CM motifs in host proteins as compared to the relatively high occurrence in viral protein provide a starting point for the analysis of treatments using methods such as these In this paper we have performed a detailed search of the Swiss Prot and Complete Human Genebank database in relation to the frequencies of each of the   natural amino acids and motifs made up of two residues 
This has provided us with a new insight into the distribution of proteins within these databases and the information that may be contained within a protein s primary amino acid sequence 
Our focus in this quest has been to examine specific pairs or triplets of residues and use probability theory to assess whether or not particular strings of residues occur more frequently than their probability would indicate 
By analyzing affinity and anti affinity  we developed a procedure to search out all two  and three residue clusters within these databases 
Through this technique  we can rapidly classify large groups of proteins into families based on the occurrence of these motifs 
Combining this concept with a specific knowledge of protein function  we propose novel ideas aimed at developing fast detection methods for specific diseases based on the unusually high occurrence of some of these motifs when compared with the expected probabilities 
A timely example of the application of this method is given  namely the analysis of the SARS virus 
This method will hopefully lead to the discovery of new diagnostic techniques and possible treatment of diseases  by recognizing the location of target domains in the expressed sequence Cell type specific expression of the putative SARS CoV  receptor ACE  in human heartsThe coronavirus disease    COVID  caused by SARS CoV  infections imposes a major threat for the world s healthcare systems and is leading to thousands of deaths 
Angiotensin converting enzyme    ACE  has been identified as a potential receptor for SARS coronavirus  and is also considered the main receptor for SARS CoV  SARS CoV  binds to ACE  via its glycosylated outer membrane spike proteins 
ACE  is highly expressed in the lung and heart  and is known for its vital role in the cardiovascular system –  Although SARS CoV  mainly invades alveolar epithelial cells  it can also cause myocardial injury  as assessed by increased troponin T and NT proBNP levels accompanying increased cardiovascular symptoms in COVID infected patients  It is unclear whether elevated biomarkers of cardiac injury  or long term effects on the cardiovascular system  are directly caused by viral infection of cardiac tissue or are secondary to hypoxia and systemic inflammation 
However  patients with underlying cardiovascular disease represent a significant proportion of the patients who may suffer from a severe course after COVID  infection  This situation may be aggravated by findings showing that ACE inhibitors  which are often used to treat cardiovascular diseases  augment the expression of the SARS CoV  receptor ACE  in lung cells  This is probably mediated by an effect on angiotensin II  which is known to reduce ACE  expression  Thus  ACE inhibition decreases angiotensin II  leading to an indirect up regulation of ACE  The effect of angiotensin II receptor blockers  ARBs  which primarily target the angiotensin receptor   is unclear 
One may speculate that ARBs indirectly reduce ACE  levels by augmenting free angiotensin II levels  which in turn is expected to down regulate ACE  via activating the angiotensin receptor  
However  the effect of the two different treatments on the expression of ACE  in the heart requires further investigation Therefore  we used single nuclei RNA sequencing to determine the expression of ACE and ACE  in the different cell types of the human heart 
Gene expression signatures were detected in cardiac tissues of five patients with aortic stenosis  AS  and two patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction  HFrEF   Figure  A  and compared with with samples of one healthy donor heart  age    years  male  that was not used for transplantation 
After single nuclei RNA sequencing  data were pooled  and unsupervised clustering was performed with a total of     nuclei 
We found   distinct clusters 
Using cell type specific gene markers  major cell types were annotated  including cardiomyocytes  six clusters  fibroblasts  one cluster  endothelial cells  three clusters  leucocytes  two clusters  pericytes  one cluster  and smooth muscle cells  one cluster   Figure  B–D 
ACE  was expressed in cardiomyocytes  Cluster   and   and mural cells  particularly pericytes  Cluster   and was detected at a lower expression level in fibroblasts  endothelial cell  and leucocytes  Figure  D 
Comparison of ACE  in a pooled analysis of nuclei of the different groups showed that ACE  was significantly elevated in cardiomyocytes of patients with heart disease compared with healthy controls  Figure  E 
ACE  was also slightly  but not significantly  increased in endothelial cells  and the expression was lower in fibroblasts of patients with heart disease compared with healthy controls  Figure  E 
Immunostaining confirmed an increased expression of ACE  in cardiomyocytes of patients with aortic stenosis  Figure  F 
In addition  ACE was augmented in cardiomyocytes of patients with AS and HFrEF  Figure  G 
Interestingly  cardiomyocytes of patients who were treated with ACE inhibitors showed a significantly higher ACE  expression compared with ARB treated patients  Figure  H 
Moreover  patients treated with ACE inhibitors had an imbalance of ACE to ACE  expression  with a more than four fold higher ACE ACE  ratio compared with healthy control cells  Figure  I In conclusion  these data provide novel insights into the cell type specific expression and regulation of ACE  in the heart 
Patients with varying heart disease aetiology show augmented expression of ACE  levels particularly in cardiomyocytes 
Treatment with ACE inhibitors tends to be associated with increased ACE  mRNA and unfavourable ACE ACE  ratios  which are believed to be a driver of cardiovascular pathologies  This study is limited by its small sample size and therefore is only hypothesis generating 
However  these novel data suggest that it will be important to monitor SARS CoV infected patients for cardiovascular complications and assess the impact of ARB ACE inhibitor therapy 
Conflict of interest  none declared New onset acute symptomatic seizure and risk factors in coronavirus disease   A retrospective multicenter studyIn December   pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus  later called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus    SARS‐CoV‐  was first reported in Wuhan  China 
On March     the World Health Organization  WHO  declared the syndrome caused by SARS‐CoV‐  infection  coronavirus disease    COVID‐  a pandemic 
According to a WHO Situation Report of April    
 
 there are   confirmed COVID‐  cases and   deaths globally 
COVID‐  affects people of all ages 
 
  
 
 and in severe cases  it may cause dyspnea  hypoxia  acute respiratory distress syndrome  and septic shock 
 
  
 

The current situation has raised concerns regarding whether people with epilepsy have a higher risk to be infected with COVID‐  and whether people would develop acute seizures during the course of COVID‐ 
The objective of this study is to clarify the incidence and the risk of acute symptomatic seizures during acute COVID‐  infections This retrospective multicenter study was approved by the ethics committee of West China Hospital  Sichuan University  approval   
The study was conducted in   officially designed hospitals in Hubei province  the epicenter of the COVID‐  epidemic in China  Sichuan province  and Chongqing municipality 
These hospitals included the East Branch of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University  West China Ward  Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital  and hospitals in Sichuan province designated by the government to treat COVID‐   see the list of hospitals in Appendix S People with COVID‐  who were discharged from or died in the participating hospitals between January   and February     were consecutively enrolled 
All cases were diagnosed according to the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for COVID‐   trial version  
 
 All those enrolled tested positive through nucleic acid detection 
Disease severity was classified as mild  moderate  severe  or critical according to the national guidelines  see Box   for classification criteria 
 
 For our study  we aggregated severe and critical cases into a single severe group  whereas mild and moderate cases were aggregated into a single milder group 
The clinical outcome at discharge was either cured or death Electronic medical records of all enrolled cases were reviewed by   neurologists using a standard case report form  Appendix S 
Data were extracted on demographic characteristics  medical history  complications  treatments  and presence of risk factors for seizures 
These risk factors were considered to be the following  acute cerebrovascular disease  traumatic brain injury  TBI  central nervous system  CNS  infection  shock  hypoxia  severe metabolic disturbance  based on criteria from the International League Against Epilepsy
 
  multiple‐organ dysfunction syndrome  sepsis  and exposure to drugs or toxic substances Continuous variables were presented as median  interquartile range  and categorical variables as n  All of   people discharged from or who died at participating hospitals were consecutively identified and enrolled 
Most were from Sichuan province  n     followed by Chongqing  n     and Hubei  n    Ten individuals died  giving case fatality rates of    n     in Hubei     n     in Chongqing  and    n     in Sichuan 
Of the   severe cases      received mechanical ventilation  and     were given sedatives 
Apart from the effect of sedatives  mental state was relatively normal in   people 
Eight were encephalopathic  one was obtunded  one was delirious  and six were comatose 
The diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus was not made in any of these cases based on clinical presentation  results of investigations  or response to therapy 
No routine or long‐term electroencephalogram  EEG  was recorded due to exposure concerns None in this cohort had a past history of epilepsy 
None had any seizures  including febrile seizures  or status epilepticus during hospitalization 
Seizurelike events were seen in two people  it was believed that this was the result of an acute stress reaction in one and hypocalcemia in the other The first was a  ‐year‐old woman who reported bilateral bodily spasms lasting for about   minute  with mouth deviation but no impairment of awareness 
She was evaluated neurologically and psychiatrically and was diagnosed with an acute anxiety disorder  which was treated with olanzapine  paroxetine  and diazepam The second case was a  ‐year‐old woman who displayed bilateral myoclonus in the limbs with no impairment in consciousness   hours after admission 
Although this was initially suspected to represent seizures  she was found to have an electrolyte disturbance including hyponatremia  hypokalemia  and hypocalcemia  and the myoclonus resolved with correction of the metabolic disturbances Eighty‐four   cases reported systemic or direct brain insults that increased their risk for acute symptomatic seizures  Table  
The most common risk factor was hypoxia 
No severe electrolyte disturbance was seen  but hypokalemia  n       hyponatremia  n       and hypocalcemia  n       were frequently seen in the cohort 
Urea  creatinine  and serum glucose levels were moderately altered in most of cases 
In two cases who had chronic kidney dysfunction  substantial increases in creatinine levels were noted 
Results of investigations are shown in Table  
One case with TBI had an epidural hematoma  cerebral contusion  and skull base fracture 
Five people with severe COVID‐  experienced septic shock 
Three other cases of shock had hypovolemia or cardiac problems 
Ninety‐four   were given antibiotics  moxifloxacin  n       piperacillin sulbactam sodium  n       and third‐generation cephalosporins  n       were most commonly used We found no new onset seizures or status epilepticus in a large cohort of people hospitalized during the acute phase of COVID   infection despite a substantial proportion having risk factors for acute symptomatic seizures 
This is useful information  given the prior lack of knowledge about seizure risk during the acute phase of infection No individual in this cohort had a history of epilepsy prior to hospital admission 
To date  there is not much information available on people with epilepsy during the COVID‐  crisis 
There is one report of epilepsy in a case COVID‐  from Wuhan 
 
 As information is limited  it is not possible to establish whether this was a patient who had a history of epilepsy or whether the patient presented acute seizures 
There is at this time little if any evidence indicating that people with epilepsy are at an increased risk of COVID‐  infection 
A major challenge for people with epilepsy in this outbreak is nonadherence with the prescribed antiseizure medication  which was seen during the in SARS endemic in  
 
 This indicates the need to ensure the availability of supplies of medications and to advocate patients  self‐management 
Possible strategies for coping could also include online consultations and telemedicine networks Although many neurological and systemic disorders regarded as potential triggers
 
 of acute symptomatic seizures were identified in this cohort  seizures and status were not seen 
Stroke is one such risk factor 
The risk of developing acute symptomatic seizures after stroke ranges from   to  
 
 Acute cerebrovascular disease is considered a major cause of seizure and status epilepticus 
An earlier study from Hubei
 
  
 
 also reported six people with COVID‐  who had acute cerebrovascular disease without seizure 
Infection of the CNS can also give rise to seizures 
Although there is limited evidence of the presence of the SARS‐CoV‐  in the cerebrospinal fluid  CSF  the co‐occurrence of tubercular meningitis
 
 had been reported  with no seizure or status observed 
To determine whether COVID‐  can cause direct CNS insults requires further follow‐up 
In the earlier outbreaks of another coronavirus  a generalized convulsion with a positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for SARS‐CoV in CSF was reported  which could have been a coincidence 
 

Disturbances of homeostasis may lead to acute symptomatic seizures 
Hypoxia  the most common complication in our cohort  may trigger anoxic encephalopathy  particularly in refractory hypoxia 
Electrolyte disturbances as seen in COVID‐  are considered to be potential causes of acute symptomatic seizure 
 
 The severity and speed of such disturbances may affect onset of seizures  so these parameters should be carefully monitored The cytokine storm syndromes
 
 behind severe infection may cause the production of inflammatory cytokines systemically  with the consequence of acute toxic encephalopathies 
Although sepsis is a common cause of encephalopathy in intensive care medicine 
 
 hypoxia appears far more often than sepsis in COVID‐ 
There was also a high rate of septic shock in the COVID‐  population  varying from  
 
 to   in earlier studies in Hubei 
 
  
 

Certain antibiotics have been associated with symptomatic seizure 
 
 Antibiotics were used in a large number of people in our cohort without problems  but the most used antibiotics in the cohort were of low or moderate risk 
Clinicians should keep this seizure risk in mind when prescribing antibiotics  especially for people with renal dysfunction 
 

Our study has several limitations 
First  as a cross‐sectional study  we only have data from the acute phase of the disease 
A follow‐up study is underway to evaluate longitudinal seizure outcomes 
Second  the retrospective study design meant that we could not collect data on all relevant variables  for example  EEG was not recorded  so subclinical seizures could have been missed 
As all health care costs of COVID‐  treatment are covered by the government  all those suspected of infection are screened 
This may assure the objectivity and reliability of study materials  and it will allow for a future follow‐up study Our analysis suggests that COVID‐  poses minimal risk for seizures during the acute illness  although a significant proportion of severely ill individuals have risk factors that may increase the propensity to experience seizures 
These risk factors should be promptly addressed to minimize the risk of developing seizures 
Prospective long‐term studies must be done to determine whether people who have suffered from COVID‐  have an increased risk for developing seizures or epilepsy in subsequent months or years as a consequence of their illness None of the authors has any conflict of interest to disclose 
We confirm that we have read the Journal s position on issues involved in ethical publication and affirm that this report is consistent with those guidelines Decreased prealbumin level is associated with increased risk of mortality in hospitalized elderly patients with COVID The coronavirus disease    COVID  epidemic is caused by an infection with a novel coronavirus  officially named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus    SARS COV 
The infection spread rapidly on all continents and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization 
As of April       documented cases were reported worldwide  and   patients had died 
As there are currently no specific treatments and medications against the new virus  it is crucial to identify risk factors of severe prognosis Older patients have poorer prognostic factors and are more likely to experience critical disease 
 
 
Based on recent statistical data of China  among patients who were   years and older  the mortality rate was   which was significantly higher than that of younger patients at  
The proportion of deaths over   years old accounts for   of the total deaths in the national wide  which implicates aged people are more vulnerable to the SARS CoV 
Till present there are rare reports in literature focusing on the risk factors for poor outcomes of the elderly patients with COVID Serum prealbumin  known as transthyretin  its levels may be lowered not only by malnutrition  but also by inflammation and aging 
 
 
Compared to albumin  prealbumin has a shorter half life  a more rapid rate of hepatic synthesis  and predictable catabolic rate  hence  it may be a more sensitive indicator 
However  whether prealbumin could be an independent predictor of mortality in hospitalized COVID  elderly patients needs to be further elucidated The present study aims to describe the clinical characteristics and to investigate whether the prealbumin can serve as a valuable predictor of in hospital mortality  which might provide evidence for the risk stratification in elderly and help to improve the clinical practice and reduce fatality We designed this study as a retrospective cohort study design 
The elderly patients with COVID  who were admitted to Tongji Hospital in Wuhan from January   to February     were consecutively included 
This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Tongji Hospital  Approval Number  TJ IRB  and was complied with the Declaration of Helsinki 
The data were anonymous and the study was observational  so the informed consent was not gathered 
A flow diagram illustrating patient selection was described in Figure  
 
Inclusion criteria included elderly patients  ≥   years old  diagnosed with COVID  infection 
A total of   participants have been obtained 
Patients having missing baseline or outcome data  died on admission or being transferred to other designated hospitals during hospitalization were excluded 
There were   patients were included in the final analyses Data collection of participants was performed using hospital electronic medical record system 
Information included medical history  demographic data  physical examination  and hematological  biochemical  radiological and microbiological evaluation results were reviewed 
The data collection forms were reviewed independently by   researchers  CL and LYY 
Blood examinations were assessed at the central laboratory of Tongji Hospital following standard operative procedures 
The routine blood test was analyzed using Sysmex XE  hematology analyzer  Sysmex  Kobe  Japan 
The Cobas C   Roche  Mannheim  Germany  was used to measure the biochemical parameters 
Coagulation tests were detected by STA R MAX coagulation analyzer  Diagnostica Stago  Saint Denis  France 
Throat swab samples were collected and were tested for SARS CoV  with commercial real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  RT PCR  kit from DAAN GENE  Guangzhou  China 
The diagnostic criteria and all clinical procedures in this study followed  Diagnosis and Treatment of Pneumonia Caused by New Coronavirus  Trial version   to   promulgated by the National Health and Health Commission of China Summary statistics of baseline characteristics of all patients and stratification by prealbumin tertiles were expressed as frequency and proportion for categorical variables  mean   standard deviation  SD   Gaussian distribution  or median  range   Skewed distribution  for continuous variables  and as percentages for categorical variables 
The differences between groups were analyzed using the χ   categorical variables  One Way ANOVA test  normal distribution  or Kruskal Whallis H test  skewed distribution We examined the relationship of the prealbumin as categorized into tertiles with the outcomes of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation 
Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to evaluate these relationships  then unadjusted and adjusted odds ratio  ORs  and   confidence intervals  CIs  were calculated 
Model   is the minimally adjusted model with only sociodemographic variables adjusted 
Model   is the fully adjusted model with covariates including age  sex  smoking status  history of hypertension  history of coronary heart disease  history of diabetes  history of chronic kidney disease  history of carcinoma  history of chronic liver disease  neutrophil  lymphocyte  prothrombin time  activated partial thromboplastin time  d dimer  alanine transaminase  aspartate aminotransferase  total bilirubin  blood urea nitrogen  creatinine  C reactive protein and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio 
We calculated odds ratio  ORs  and   confidence intervals  CIs 
The highest tertile was the reference for prealbumin 
We performed test for linear trend by entering the median value of each category of prealbumin tertile as continuous variable to examine the possibility of nonlinearity To ensure the robustness of our results  we also performed stratified analyses with the prealbumin as a continuous variable for the overall population and stratified by gender  age  hypertension status and coronary heart disease status at baseline 
Generalized additive models were used to visually confirm the relationship between prealbumin as continuous variable and the risk of outcomes  all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation Modeling was performed with the statistical software packages R  http www R project org  The R Foundation  and EmpowerStats  http www empowerstats com  X Y Solutions  Inc  Boston  MA 
P values less than    two sided  were considered statistically significant In our study    cases were excluded 
To avoid selection bias due to missing data  we performed a sensitivity analysis 
The results showed that there was no statistical difference between missing group and non missing group  supplemental table  Of   elderly inpatients included in the final analysis  the mean age was     years  ranging from   years to   years  and most patients were male  table  
 
The baseline characteristics of these included participants were listed in table 
The day of sample drawing after admission was       day 
No significant statistical difference in sex  smoking status  body weight  BMI  comorbidity  hypertension  coronary heart disease  chronic kidney disease  cerebral vascular disease  carcinoma  chronic liver disease  symptoms  fever  cough  headache  diarrhea and myalgia fatigue at admission  were detected across different groups of prealbumin  tertile 
When compared with subjects in the highest tertile  those in the lowest tertile were older  more likely to have diabetes medical history  with higher Neutrophil count  lower lymphocyte count  worse coagulation function and liver function 
A total of     patients required mechanical ventilation      patients admitted to intensive care unit and     patients died during hospitalization 
The incidence of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation were significantly decreased across prealbumin tertiles  all cause death    vs    vs    for tertile   vs  tertile   vs  tertile   ICU admission    vs    vs    for tertile   vs  tertile   vs  tertile   mechanical ventilation    vs    vs    for tertile   vs  tertile   vs  tertile   respectively To investigate the correlation between prealbumin and in hospital outcomes  we constructed three models using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models  table  
 
In the unadjusted model  the ORs of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation was significantly increased as the prealbumin tertiles downgraded 
The OR for tertile   was significantly higher than the OR for tertile    OR       CI    to   P   for all cause death  OR       CI    to   P   for ICU admission  OR       CI    to   P   for mechanical ventilation 
Additional adjustment for the demographic variables and comorbidities did not reduce the ORs for the association between prealbumin tertiles and in hospital outcomes 
Further adjusting for the baseline levels of blood examinations  including blood routine  neutrophil  lymphocyte  neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio  coagulation function  prothrombin time  activated partial thromboplastin time  d dimer  liver fuction  alanine transaminase  aspartate aminotransferase  total bilirubin  renal function  blood urea nitrogen  creatinine  and infection indicators  C reactive protein  did not affect the relationships in the fully adjusted models  OR       CI    to   P   for all cause death  OR       CI    to   P   for ICU admission  OR       CI    to   P     for mechanical ventilation 
Therefore  lower tertile of prealbumin exhibited an increased risk of worse in hospital outcomes  full adjusted P for trend for all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation  P     P   and P     respectively Generalized additive models  Fig  
A through  C  were used to visually assess functional relationships between the prealbumin as continuous variate and the risk of in hospital outcomes 
Serum prealbumin was found to have negative linear relationship with the risk of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation To determine the consistency of the relationship between baseline prealbumin as a continuous variable and in hospital outcomes  we conducted stratified analyses  Table  
 
For each unit increase of prealbumin  the adjusted OR for all cause death was   in males  P     and   in females  P    
The adjusted OR for all cause death for persons less than   years of age was    P     compared with    p     for persons   years and older  P interaction    
For each unit increase of the prealbumin  the OR for all cause death was    P     and    P     for normotensives and hypertensives     P     and    P     for non diabetic and diabetes respectively 
The difference of interaction was not significant between two groups  P interaction         and   stratified for gender  age  hypertention and diabetes respectively 
Moreover  the relationship between baseline prealbumin with ICU admission and mechanical ventilation stratified by gender  age  hypertention and diabetes are consistent In this study  we found that lower serum prealbumin significantly associated with an increased risk of worse outcomes and all cause death during hospitalization 
Patients in the lowest tertile of prealbumin were older  and with higher Neutrophil count  lower lymphocyte count  worse coagulation function and liver function compared with subjects in the highest tertile 
Then we adjusted relevant covariates including age  sex  smoking status  comorbidities  neutrophil  lymphocyte  coagulation function  liver function  renal function and C reactive protein to minimize the potential impact of confounding 
Compared with crude regression analyses  this association still persisted when adjusting for demographic and clinical variables in the multivariable regression analyses 
Moreover  stratified by gender  age  hypertension and diabetes  increased level of serum prealbumin was associated with the decreased risk of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation  which determine the consistency of the relationship between lowest serum prealbumin tertile and the increased risk of worse outcomes in elderly COVID  patients Several previous studies have demonstrated baseline prealbumin change in COVID  patients 
Decreased level of prealbumin was observed among COVID  patients 
Wu C et al investigated   patients with COVID  and observed that prealbumin was associated with the development of ARDS  indicating the potential value of prealbumin level on COVID  clinical ending 
Till date  no report exists on the effect of prealbumin in COVID  elderly patients High proportion of severe to critical cases and high fatality rate were observed in the elderlyCOVID  patients  and rapid disease progress was noted in the dead 
One possible explanation involves the greater potential of seniors to be in a state of inflammation  nutritional deficiency and other complications 
Prealbumin is a globular  non glycosilated protein  synthesized by the liver  and complexed with a retinol binding protein  which acts as a transporter of retinol vitamin A and thyroid hormones 
Low plasma prealbumin level has far back emerged as an earliest laboratory indicator of poor nutritional status 
 
 
In addition  prealbumin are also associated with inflammation 
Previous studies showed that in response to the inflammation  the body responds by synthesizing a large number of cytokines 
These include interleukins and tumor necrosis factors that down regulate  decrease  plasma concentrations of albumin and prealbumin 
 
 
Therefore  assay of serum prealbumin concentration is recommended by some investigators as a screening marker for both malnutrition and inflammation Elderly with low plasma prealbumin levels mean that those people are at greater risk of malnutrition and inflammatory conditions  which may lead to poor prognosis 
Malnutrition is commonly seen in hospitalized patients in both the developed and developing world  especially among elderly patients 
A review of   published studies of acute care patients reported that malnutrition incidence ranged from  –  of hospitalized elderly 
It was found that compared to non famine regions of India  experiencing famine had significantly higher influenza mortality rates during the   Influenza pandemic 
Aging  frailty  and chronic diseases are associated with impaired immune function and are compounded by immune dysregulation from malnutrition 
When immune response is dysregulated  it would result in an excessive inflammation  even death 
In the current COVID  study  it was found that elderly patients have higher levels of white blood cells counts  CRP  inflammatory cytokines and are more likely to experience critical disease than did those younger patients 
 
 This retrospective cohort study included   elderly COVID  patients  until the date of February       of patients required mechanical ventilation    of patients admitted to intensive care unit  and the total in hospital mortality was  
The mortality rate was lower than that reported by wang L et al  among elderly COVID  patients 
This may have been the reason for some patients at the date of February     are still in hospital 
Nevertheless  this would not bias the relationship between prealbumin and in hospital outcomes because of the definite observation time we set previously 
Moreover  Wuhan tongji Hospital as one of the largest third grade Class A hospitals equipped with advanced life support training and equipment may partly account for the moderate mortality The results of this study have several clinical implications and strengths 
A low prealbumin concentration can therefore be regarded primarily as a signal identifying the at risk elderly patient who would suffer worse outcomes and requires careful assessment and monitoring for whom nutritional support and Inflammation detection may be needed as part of the treatment plan 
As observational study was susceptible to various confounders  we adjusted many variables that may affect the relationship between prealbumin and in hospital outcomes to minimize potential confounding 
In addition  we tested the robustness of the results by repeating the analyses in different subgroups of gender  age  history of hypertension and history of diabetes Our study has some limitations 
First  by including patients still in hospital as of J February     the case fatality ratio in our study cannot reflect the true mortality of elderly COVID 
Second  the record of data may be affected by prehospital medication and the time interval between admission and onset 
Third  since all subjects in our study were hospitalized Chinese elderly patients diagnosed with COVID  results of this study might not directly be applied to other ethnicities and age groups In conclusion  this retrospective cohort study revealed that the prealbumin is an independent risk factor for the in hospital mortality in the Chinese COVID  elderly patients 
Nutritional support and Inflammation detection should be careful assessment and monitoring for the elderly patients with low prealbumin concentration

Coping With COVID  Emergency Stress  Secondary Trauma and Self Efficacy in Healthcare and Emergency Workers in ItalyThe coronavirus disease  COVID  or the acute respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus    SARS CoV  began spreading in China at the end of   and  to date  represents an international health emergency without precedents in terms of its health  economic  and organizational effects on people s lives  World Health Organization   
After China  Italy was the first country to be affected by this epidemic  with the first deaths on February     and a rapid increase in the spread of infection and mortality 
COVID  was first detected in Northern Italy  and it then spread  although at different rates of incidence  to the other regions 
It was immediately evident that healthcare and emergency workers were at great risk of contagion and that protection and intervention protocols needed to be introduced in the absence of adequate points of reference because of the exceptional nature of the epidemic  the rate of spread of the infection  the seriousness of patients  health condition  and the mortality index 
The extreme conditions in which health workers have had to work  especially in the most affected regions in Northern Italy  are indicated by the following data from the Italian National Institute of Health   over   doctors died and   other health workers were infected within the general context of the population of   deaths and   infections in a span of   weeks 
It was also clear that the medical staff would experience serious psychological repercussions because of the working conditions as well as the difficulty of having scientific points of reference on care and intervention procedures 
To this must be added the increase in workload  the extension of working hours and  for health workers  the frequent exposure to the suffering and death of their patients 
Therefore  healthcare and emergency workers were subjected to serious psychological as well as physical stress 
Hence  the aim of this study  which was also the aim of a previous study  Vagni et al    is to focus on the similarities and the differences in the stress management of two professional groups healthcare and emergency workers during the acute phase of the pandemic 
Both groups have had to deal with COVID patients as frontline responders and have been exposed to the related risks of infection and psychological consequences  which  to date  have not been examined in detail through a comparative analysis As regards the stress that they experience  the literature clearly explains that healthcare and emergency workers who intervene in emergency situations are exposed to the risk of developing dysfunctional reactions that can be identified at different levels physical and or physiological  e g  psychosomatic disorders  sleep wake cycle alterations  and sense of tiredness  emotional  e g  irritability  nervousness  agitation  anger  low self esteem  and guilt  cognitive  e g  distractibility  sense of ineffectiveness  and negative anticipation of events  and relational  e g  increase in conflicts within emergency teams and or with their organization institution  and social withdrawal and may also develop reactions from secondary trauma  Del Missier et al    Sbattella    Argentero and Setti    Fraccaroli and Balducci    Bellelli and Di Schiena    Walton et al   
Faced with stressful events regarding which they lack previous experience and specific  necessary knowledge  and which cause tension owing to the need for rapid decision timings and a sense of responsibility  emergency workers may experience a sense of decision ineffectiveness 
In fact  emergency situations are characterized by high levels of decisional and operational uncertainty with associated regret and guilt  Del Missier et al   Several studies have highlighted that insufficient instructions and a lack of personal protective equipment  PPE  are important predictors of stress for healthcare and emergency workers in large scale emergencies  Oh et al    Du et al    El Hage et al    Walton et al   
Oh et al 
  highlighted that nurses involved in managing the Middle East respiratory syndrome  MERS  experienced lower levels of stress when the levels of goods supply and hospital training were higher 
Some studies have highlighted that frontline healthcare workers had lower secondary traumatization scores than non frontline health workers and the general public in contrast to the findings of previous research on the SARS outbreak in the same area in Singapore  Chan and Huak   
According to Barleycorn   and Tan et al 
  these results may be due to the dedicated training and psychological support given to healthcare workers after the SARS outbreak and demonstrate the validity of policy strategies for prevention of stress in the psychological health field An analysis of   studies published from January to March   aimed at investigating the stress experience of healthcare workers in facing COVID  shows that health workers experienced symptoms of depression and anxiety related to this stressful experience 
Moreover  the severity of their symptoms was influenced by their age  gender  role  specialization  type of activity performed  and exposure to patients with COVID  however  prevention  resilience  and social support interventions mediated their response to stress  Bohlken et al   
In a review of the literature  Spoorthy   underlined that sociodemographic variables  such as age  gender  profession  and workplace  and psychological variables  such as poor social support and self efficacy  affect the stress level experienced by health workers 
In addition  COVID  emerged as an independent stress risk factor 
Xiao et al 
  found that social support plays a role in reducing the anxiety levels in medical staff and increases their sense of self efficacy According to Walton et al 
  the specific stressors that health workers face in the COVID  emergency are related to the organizational context 
The challenges for medical staff include not only an increased workload but also a fear of infection  the need to work with new protocols that change frequently  and the use of PPE 
In uncontrollable situations such as a pandemic  when specific action protocols are absent and limited resources are available  health workers must make individual decisions with a heavy burden of responsibility that may be contrary to their moral principles 
For example  in the case of COVID  they may have to choose which patients to save because only a few places are available in intensive care 
In this regard  Cai et al 
  showed that for a sample of   healthcare professionals who worked closely with COVID  patients in Hubei  the most stressful factors were the lack of protocols for the treatment of COVID  the scarcity of PPE  the exhausting work shifts  their concern about the risk of infection  and their exposure to the death and suffering of their patients 
They also found that the support of superiors proved to be one of the most important motivational factors for medical staff  and the presence of clear guidelines and effective safety protocols were protective factors against the development of stress  in particular  for females 
Further  Walton et al 
  identified the organizational stressors as the changes in work shifts  the prevalence of night shifts  an excessive workload  staff roles  autonomy  the lack of support from superiors  and the absence of adequate information and clear instructions 
On the basis of these stressors  they estimated that   of the medical staff working on the front line of this pandemic are at risk of developing post traumatic stress disorder  PTSD 
In addition  limited resources  longer shifts  decreased hours of rest  and the occupational risks associated with COVID  exposure have increased the physical and mental fatigue  stress  anxiety  and burnout of these staff members  Sasangohar et al   The loss of a social support network  which can be an important resilience factor  is another risk factor  Ozbay et al   
In the COVID  emergency  healthcare and emergency workers have often experienced a separation from their affective links  either because of the restrictions on social contacts imposed by the lockdown or the fear of spreading the infection to their family members 
To this must be added that although  at first  health workers received unanimous encouragement from the population  later  they also experienced demonstrations of stigma and isolation 
Some studies have shown that being able to resort to their own social support network is a significant protective factor for health workers dealing with this emergency  Cai et al   As Favretto   stated  when individuals experience situations that go beyond their coping strategies  their vulnerability to  and risk of developing  psychopathological reactions increases 
Studies conducted during previous epidemics  such as the SARS  MERS  and Ebola epidemics  converge in detecting how healthcare and emergency workers may experience extremely high levels of stress and even develop secondary traumatic stress or vicarious trauma 
This trauma is defined as an experience of symptoms similar to those found in people with PTSD  such as in emergency nurses working with traumatized patients  Beck   
Figley   defined it as a form of stress that derives from the feelings of empathy experienced when helping traumatized people 
The symptoms may include intrusive recurring thoughts  disturbed sleep  fatigue  physical symptoms  hyperarousal  increased stress response  anxiety  depression  and feeling emotional  Adriaenssens et al   
Wolf et al 
  described how nurses may feel  overwhelmed  and this condition becomes a source of moral distress that triggers feelings of powerlessness  guilt  fear  anger  and frustration The sense of frustration and impotence felt by nurses when they are unable to treat and save a patient has been highlighted as a risk factor for secondary traumatic stress in several studies  Missouridou   
Avoidance and emotional numbing can become tools for self protection from intrusive symptoms that exceed the personal tolerance level  Coetzee and Klopper    Mealer and Jones   
Their frustration obviously intensifies on a patient s death 
The onset of PTSD in the health workers involved in treating MERS was also detected after the acute phase of the emergency was over  highlighting a risk not only in the immediate period but also in the medium term period  Lee et al   In reference to COVID  updated studies conducted on Chinese health workers have already highlighted the strong impact of the epidemic on the psychological health of doctors and nurses 
Some studies have found that healthcare workers have high levels of anxiety  depression  insomnia  and distress  Lai et al    Li et al    Zhu et al   
In particular  female professionals with more than   years of experience and previous psychiatric pathology present more risk factors of developing the symptoms of stress  anxiety  and depression  Lai et al    Zhu et al   
Huang J 
Z  et al 
  studied stress levels during the COVID  emergency in a sample of medical staff 
They found that females showed higher levels of anxiety and PTSD than males did and that the levels were higher for nurses than for doctors 
Moreover  Li et al 
  found that nurses had developed higher levels of vicarious trauma than those of the general population and that nurses who did not work closely with COVID  patients showed a more severe symptomatology  both physical and psychological  compared with their colleagues working on the frontline emergency services 
In Italy  a study conducted on healthcare workers found that doctors and nurses developed high levels of stress and anxiety  greater than those developed by the general population  and that healthcare workers operating in the North  the area of Italy most affected by the virus  showed a more severe symptomatology  Simione and Gnagnarella   
This study also confirmed that females tend to have a greater perception of the risk of infection  which increases their risk of developing the symptoms of anxiety and distress Because of their long  intense exposure to various stressors  it is important to note the nature of the coping strategies used by these healthcare and emergency workers in these situations and their effectiveness in terms of reducing and effectively coping with stress 
Indeed  the effective management of stress levels in the acute emergency phase could reduce the risk of developing long term PTSD or other pathologies  such as anxiety and depression  Fullerton et al    Slottje et al    Argentero and Setti    Sakuma et al    Birinci and Erden    Li et al   
Coping may be defined as a series of cognitive and behavioral efforts to manage specific internal or external issues that test or exceed individual resources  Lazarus and Folkman   
A distinction can be made between problem focused and emotion focused coping strategies 
The former is aimed at modifying and solving the stressful situation through active interventions 
By contrast  emotion focused coping is aimed at managing the emotions connected to the stressful event and regulating affective reactions  such as anxiety and the tension of response to stress  for example  by trying to avoid the threat  denial  or re evaluating it  reappraisal The choice of coping strategies is influenced by the individual s cognitive evaluation of the event  termed secondary evaluation  which involves estimating the resources available and the most effective strategies to deal with the situation  Lazarus and Folkman   
A key element of this assessment is the extent to which the individual can maintain control over the outcome of the situation 
The literature indicates that individuals apply dysfunctional coping when they face an uncontrollable event by responding primarily with a coping strategy focused on the problem  and conversely  when they face a controllable situation  they respond with coping strategies focused on emotions  Strentz and Auerbach    Vitaliano et al   
A coping strategy may be defined as adaptive when the controllability of the stressful event corresponds with the choice of coping strategy  in this case  the subject will experience fewer symptoms related to stress  Park et al   The strategies used to cope with trauma may differ among individuals  but they can also vary according to the profession and the features of the traumatic event  Nydegger et al   
Individuals differ in their choice of coping strategies  Connor Smith and Flachsbart    and factors related to the situation can also have a decisive influence on such choice  Brown et al   
A few studies have considered the ways in which gender influences the perception of stress in emergency situations and the choice of coping strategy 
These studies highlight that females tend to perceive events as more negative and uncontrollable and to resort more to coping strategies focused on emotions and avoidance  whereas males tend to resort more to applying problem focused coping and to inhibiting emotions  Matud    Matud et al    Matud and Garcia   The literature on the relationship between coping strategies and the stress levels of emergency workers has shown that the use of coping strategies focused on the problem usually tends to correlate with lower stress levels  both in healthcare workers  Watson et al    Howlett et al    and in other emergency workers  such as firefighters  Brown et al   
However  a coping strategy frequently used by emergency workers is that of avoidance and minimization  and this strategy is associated with higher levels of stress  Brown et al    Chang et al    Kerai et al    Witt et al    Theleritis et al   
Loo et al 
  found that in a group of emergency workers  avoidance as well as coping strategies focused on emotions were associated with the development of post traumatic symptomatology 
Rodríguez Rey et al 
  revealed that among health workers working in a pediatric emergency department  approximately   of the variance in PTSD was explained by the frequent use of coping strategies focused on emotions and the infrequent use of those focused on the problem 
In addition  Kucmin et al 
  who considered a sample of   paramedics  highlighted that the risk of developing PTSD symptoms was predicted by the use of coping strategies focused on emotions However  the literature does not offer unanimous results 
Chamberlin and Green   found that in a group of firefighters  all coping strategies actually correlated with high levels of stress  the authors explained this finding by suggesting that it is not the individual coping strategies that are maladaptive in themselves  but that greater effort is needed to adjust in stressful situations 
By contrast  Young et al 
  indicated that firefighters use problem focused coping strategies more often at the beginning of the operation and emotion focused coping strategies more commonly in the phase of breakdown and fatigue 
However  after the incident  they use both strategies  Young et al   
A meta analysis by Shin et al 
  highlighted that different coping strategies have different effects on work burnout  in particular  emotional stress and depersonalization are associated with the use of emotion focused coping strategies  whereas professional ineffectiveness is associated with the use of problem focused strategies Further  a few studies have investigated the coping strategies that emergency workers can use during health emergencies similar to COVID 
Maunder et al 
  revealed that healthcare professionals who tended to apply dysfunctional coping strategies  based on avoidance  hostile comparison  or self blame  tended to develop higher stress levels 
Wong et al 
  highlighted that during the SARS epidemic  doctors and nurses tended to use different coping strategies 
The doctors tended to turn more to action planning  but this strategy did not affect their stress level 
Instead  their stress level was positively correlated with their use of coping strategies based on emotional outlets 
By contrast  the nursing staff tended to resort more to behavioral disengagement and distraction strategies  which  however  correlated with higher levels of stress among them In this regard  during the MERS epidemic  hospital staff tended to adopt coping strategies related to the use of PPE and the adoption of all prevention measures  as well as social support  whereas the coping strategy that they adopted the least was that based on an emotional outlet  Khalid et al   
A recent study on healthcare workers in Hubei  China  during the COVID  epidemic  Cai et al    yielded similar results  to reduce stress  the medical staff tended to rely on active coping strategies  such as using security protocols  practicing social isolation measures  and seeking support from family and friends  but they did not find it necessary to discuss their emotions with a professional 
Huang L  et al 
  found that a sample of nurses working during the COVID  emergency presented greater emotional reactions and turned more to problem focused coping compared with university nursing students 
Emergency workers must have sufficient self efficacy in terms of their coping skills to be able to manage and cope with stress levels 
Self efficacy in coping appears to be an effective protective factor in relation to stress levels and maladaptive responses  Chesney et al   
Self efficacy to cope with traumatic events has been effective in reducing the risk of developing PTSD  Bosmans et al   The main objective of this study is to identify the coping strategies activated by healthcare and emergency workers to deal with stress factors related to the COVID  emergency that may be associated with the risk of developing vicarious or secondary trauma 
Few studies have considered both groups simultaneously when analyzing the strategies they have adopted to manage stress during the COVID  emergency 
Hence  in this study  we are interested in detecting the similarities and differences in the approaches they adopted to manage their stress during the acute phase of the current pandemic According to Walton et al 
  the main acute stress reactions of emergency workers to emergency medical situations are emotional  cognitive  physical  and social reactions 
Therefore  these factors were included in the questionnaire used in the present study 
Moreover  reactions linked to stress factors for difficulties due to ineffective decision making and dealing with stress were also considered  Chesney et al   
In addition  fears regarding contracting the virus and infecting their own families because of COVID  were specifically considered  Du et al    Huang J 
Z  et al    Ornell et al    Walton et al   Based on results found in the literature  the specific objectives of this study are as follows Participants were selected on a voluntary basis through a trasversal sampling in order to take a picture of the situation caused by the pandemic emergency 
We used an internet platform to conduct the study and approached the participants using social media  dedicated mailing lists  and forums 
Participants from all Italian regions completed the questionnaire online 
The sample consists of   participants  males   and   females  whose average age was   years  SD     min   – max  
Further    of the sample were married    were separated  and the remaining   were single 
We selected various professional figures who had directly worked in various sectors during the COVID  emergency and who could be divided into two main groups 
The first  the  Health Group  consists of   participants   who were healthcare workers    doctors     nurses     psychologists   and seven healthcare assistants  
Their average age was   years  SD     and their average years of active professional service was    SD    
The second  the  Emergency Group  consists of   participants     emergency workers     firefighters   and   Civil Protection staff   whose average age was   years  SD     and average years of service was    SD    
There was an age difference between the two groups  t     p   and the distribution of the gender variable differed between the two groups  with   males and   females in the Health Group and   males and   females in the Emergency Group  χ    p    
The study involved participants from the entire national territory  and their workplace could be divided as follows      and   were from North  Central  and South Italy  respectively 
Further    of the sample worked directly with COVID  patients and   worked in specific COVID  departments 
Among the healthcare workers    had worked in direct contact with COVID  patients  whereas among the emergency workers  only   had assisted these patients  χ    p    
In the present study  we included two variables  lack of necessary instructions and lack of PPE  in accordance with the findings in the literature on their impact on the stress reactions of healthcare and emergency workers during the COVID  pandemic 
Among the participants    and   of healthcare and emergency workers  respectively  did not have sufficient instructions to intervene  χ    p n s 
  and   and   of healthcare and emergency workers  respectively  lacked adequate PPE when working  χ    p n s 
 This study used an online questionnaire and was conducted during the lockdown period owing to the COVID  pandemic 
The questionnaire had three parts  one each to collect online informed consent and baseline sociodemographic information  and one with an online series of questionnaires  as described in the next section 
Participants  anonymity was maintained in collecting the data 
The institutional Ethics Committee approved all the procedures This instrument s   items enable verification of the presence of two symptoms of vicarious trauma  Intrusion and Arousal  and their relative frequency 
The STSS was built on the basis of the conceptualization expressed in the DSM   American Psychiatric Association    regarding the characteristic PTSD symptoms 
In detail  the Arousal items describe situations characterized by anxiety  confusion  physical and psychological complaints  and agitation 
Intrusion refers to the re experiencing of the traumatic event even if not directly suffered through internal images and memories 
Instructions for the STSS I indicated that respondents should specify how frequently an item was true for them in the previous   weeks 
The statements are evaluated on a  point scale     never      very often  that provides scores for Intrusion  example items   I thought about my work with victims when I didn t intend to   Reminders of my work with clients upset me  and Arousal  example items   I had trouble concentrating   I was easily annoyed   I expected something bad to happen   I felt jumpy 
The reliability coefficients of the instrument are   and   for Arousal and Intrusion  respectively This is a  item measure of perceived self efficacy for coping with challenges and threats 
This measure focuses on the changes in individuals  confidence in their ability to cope effectively  based on the self efficacy theory  Bandura    Chesney et al   
Participants were asked   When things aren t going well for you  or when you re having problems  how confident or certain are you that you can do the following  Then  they were asked to rate on an  point scale the extent to which they believed they could perform important behaviors for adaptive coping 
The instrument yields three subscale scores   problem focused coping   α      stop unpleasant emotions and thoughts   α     and  support   α    
Anchor points on the scale are    cannot do at all     moderately certain can do  and    certain can do We constructed an ad hoc  item questionnaire that included Yes No questions to detect stress factors identified by the literature  such as the availability of suitable equipment and the receipt of clear instructions during the COVID  coping experience 
In this study  we present the results related to two of these items   Instructions  which refers to having received the necessary instructions to intervene  and  Equipment  which refers to having PPE 
Predictions of these factors have also been made in other studies  Du et al    Walton et al   
In light of the relevance and specificity of the lack of clear information or instructions and adequate PPE in the management of COVID  in the Italian context  as well as the findings in other studies  we decided to focus attention on these two risk factors Our analysis of the literature revealed that in situations in which they have to cope with a pandemic  several factors may affect the stress of medical staff and emergency healthcare workers and that COVID  represents an independent specific stressor  Spoorthy   
These stress factors have been identified as frequently affecting healthcare and emergency workers in emergency situations and leading to physical  emotional  cognitive  decision making  relational  and organizational stress  Del Missier et al    Sbattella    Argentero and Setti    Fraccaroli and Balducci    Bellelli and Di Schiena    Du et al    Walton et al   
Focusing on the specificity of the COVID  epidemic  items have been constructed regarding the fears of contracting the infection and of infecting colleagues or family members  Walton et al    since COVID  represents a factor of independent stress  Spoorthy    that has great impact  Huang J 
Z  et al   
Consequently  we constructed the ESQ consisting of   items assessed on a  point Likert scale  with scores ranging from    not at all  to    very much  grouped into six scales 
The participants were asked to indicate how often they experienced certain emotions and thoughts while performing intervention and emergency activities during the COVID  pandemic The scales correspond to the factors identified and confirmed by factorial analysis through an analysis of the main components with orthogonal rotation of factors  varimax 
The number of factors to be extracted was initially verified through the unit s largest eigenvalue criterion and  subsequently  by the scree test 
The ESQ is based on six scales The ESQ demonstrated good internal consistency  α     overall and for each individual scale  Organizational–Relational Stress  α     Physical Stress  α     Inefficacy Decisional Stress  α     Emotional Stress  α     Cognitive stress  α     and COVID  Stress  α    First  we performed Pearson s correlation analyses to identify the associations between the variables for the two groups that we considered in this study 
Subsequently  we checked for significant differences between the two groups as their stress levels  coping strategies  and secondary trauma 
We used hierarchical linear regression models to verify the predictive effect of the risk factors  lack of adequate information and PPE  on the different stress levels  in step  
Then  we verified the protective effect of the coping strategies  in step  
The models were controlled for age  gender  and group 
Lastly  we used hierarchical regression models to verify the predictive effect of stress factors on the components of secondary trauma 
The models were controlled for age  gender  and group First  we conducted correlational analyses and comparisons of averages on the reference sample 
Table   shows the correlations between the scales of the ESQ and the other instruments Preliminary comparisons were made through the Student s t test between the Health Group and the Emergency Group in relation to the ESQ  CSES SF  and STSS I scores 
Table   shows the comparison between the two groups As shown in Table   significant differences emerged between the two groups in relation to their Stress and Arousal levels 
The results indicate higher levels of both for the Health Group  and that emergency workers turn more to the Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts strategy 
Further  we performed comparisons with reference to the gender variable to detect differences in the levels of stress factors  coping strategies  and secondary trauma 
Females reported significantly higher Physical Stress than males did  Females  M     SD     Males  M     SD     t     p     as well as Emotional Stress  Females  M     SD     Males  M     SD     t     p     and COVID  Stress  Females  M     SD     Males  M     SD     t     p    
No gender difference emerged in coping strategies and secondary trauma 
Within the Health Group  there were significant differences regarding Inefficacy Decisional Stress  F     p     Doctor M     SD     Psychologist M     SD     average difference     p     and COVID  Stress  F     p     Nurse M     SD     Doctor M     SD     difference     p    
Within the Emergency Group  there were no differences in levels of stress and secondary trauma or coping strategies 
Moreover  we found similar correlations between the two groups for the Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts strategy and the stress factors  whereas for the other two coping strategies  we found a different association  particularly for the Emergency Group 
However  the t test comparisons highlight differences only at the level of the Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts strategy 
Given the findings of the preliminary analyses  we considered it necessary to include the age  gender  and group variables to test the predictiveness of the coping strategies on the participants  stress levels To test the predictive effect of the coping strategies on various levels of stress  hierarchical regression was conducted 
Considering the Age and Gender differences within the groups  we included these variables in all models together with the Group variable  Health vs 
Emergency  and the  Instructions  and  Equipment  variables 
The models generated by assuming the ESQ scales as dependent variables are shown in Table  
Regarding the coping strategies  we observed an important effect of the Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts Coping strategy on all the stress scales  except for Physical Stress where the effect of the Focused Problem Coping strategy is recorded As shown in Table   significant negative associations between stressors and secondary trauma were found for both groups 
The hierarchical regression models of stress scales were analyzed for the Arousal and Intrusion levels of secondary trauma 
The models included the Age  Gender  Health Emergency Group variables  and the ESQ scales 
The results are shown in Table  The same regression models were generated by including coping strategies as predictors and were analyzed by Age  Gender  and Health Emergency Group 
Compared with Arousal  the Health Emergency Group and Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts are predictive  R    F     p     Beta  ∗∗∗  Beta  ∗  respectively 
Compared with Intrusion  only the Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts variable  R    F     p     Beta  ∗  assumes significance This study has several limitations 
The first is the limited sample size 
The second is that our study involved participants in the very midst of the COVID  emergency  which means that the level of stress in healthcare workers may have been more severe and acute 
Moreover  the long term psychological implications for the healthcare and emergency population should be investigated for the presence of a full secondary trauma 
Therefore  a large sized longitudinal study is called for to further explore the pathogenesis of vicarious traumatization 
The third is that participants were not selected based on whether they had existing psychological problems 
In proposing the hypothesis of this study  we anticipated that we would be able to discover the relationships between coping strategies  emergency related stress  and secondary trauma in healthcare and emergency workers and commenced our investigation by assuming that the impact of stress can provoke psychological consequences in emergency situations 
In future work  this assumption could be tested to verify whether an emergency situation has a different impact on workers who have already experienced psychological problems The raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors  without undue reservation  to any qualified researcher The studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by Comitato Etico per la Sperimentazione Umana – CESU of the University of Urbino

As reported by some  the association of acute kidney injury  AKI  and COVID  has a high mortality   
However  the incidence of reported AKI associated with COVID  varies widely             
It would be expected that kidney involvement is frequent since the virus enters the cell through the angiotensin converting enzyme    ACE  which is expressed  in addition to pulmonary type   alveolar cells  on renal proximal tubular cells  glomerular visceral and parietal epithelium  and the cytoplasm of the distal tubules and collecting ducts         
In addition  COVID  induces hemodynamic instability and severe inflammation  which  in addition to direct renal infection  can induce acute tubular necrosis  ATN 
We report our experience with AKI in COVID  patients in an inner city  predominantly minority  and a low socioeconomic group and compare our experience with other studies in significantly different cohorts of patients 
We identify the incidence  risk factors  and prognosis of AKI and thus provide a broader understanding of this complication in a group of patients not specifically reported upon to date All adult patients   years of age admitted to the Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center with COVID  infection from March   through April     were studied in this retrospective analysis done in a single medical center serving a low income minority population in Brooklyn  NY 
It was one of the single centers with the most admissions of COVID  patients 
COVID  infection was diagnosed based on clinical presentation  radiographic lung abnormalities  and a positive result of real time PCR 
We excluded COVID  patients from our study if they were on maintenance hemodialysis or were renal transplant recipients 
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Brookdale Hospital and did not require patient consent because of its retrospective design We collected the demographics  the presenting clinical symptoms when available  prior medical history including outpatient medications and prior level of renal function  comorbidities  and in hospital laboratory data from the electronic medical record  Epic Hyperspace   
Laboratory data consisted of complete blood count  hemostasis parameters  renal and liver function  PF ratio  arterial oxygen partial pressure  PaO  fractional inspired oxygen  FiO   creatinine kinase  lactate dehydrogenase  and inflammatory markers including high sensitivity C reactive protein  hs CRP  ferritin  and D dimer 
Normal range of these measures was provided by our laboratory The Kidney Disease  Improving Global Outcome  KDIGO    definition was used to identify AKI 
Estimated glomerular filtration rate  eGFR  on admission was taken as baseline eGFR and was divided into   and ≥  mL min  m 
eGFR was estimated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study  MDRD  equation 
The earliest day of the serum creatinine change that met the KDIGO criteria for AKI was selected as day   of AKI 
The peak serum creatinine value was used to determine the stage of AKI  with an increase in the serum creatinine of  –   –  and   times the baseline serum creatinine defined as AKI stages     and   respectively Continuous variables were described as mean   standard deviation for normally distributed data  or median and interquartile range  IQR  values for non normal distribution 
Categorical variables were presented as frequency and percentage 
The mean of continuous variables was compared by using independent t tests  the Wilcoxon rank sum test  and the Kruskal Wallis test  across the stages of AKI 
The proportion of categorical variables was compared by using χ  test 
Fischer s exact test was used when there were only limited data available 
The Kaplan Meier method  log rank test  was used to determine the cumulative incidence of in hospital mortality 
We used the Cox proportional hazard  PH  regression to determine the association of kidney disease indicators and in hospital mortality 
The assumptions of the Cox PH model were checked using the Schoenfeld residuals  and no violations of the assumptions were present 
In the multivariable analysis  separate Cox PH models were used to determine the association of baseline eGFR and blood urea nitrogen  BUN  on admission  proteinuria  hematuria  and stages of AKI with in hospital mortality since these variables showed a highly significant correlation 
Variables for Cox PH regression were selected using stepwise regression 
Variables with α level of risk factor   were entered into the model 
While evaluating the association of hematuria and proteinuria with in hospital mortality by the Cox PH model  patients with missing values  n     were excluded from the analysis 
All statistical analyses were performed using the STATA version   software and a p value of   was used to determine statistical significance In this study    adult confirmed cases of COVID  were initially reviewed 
Patients on maintenance hemodialysis  n     were excluded from the study and   patients were used for the analysis 
Baseline characteristics of these patients are shown in Table  
  of our cohort were African Americans and   were Hispanics 
The median age of the patients was   years  IQR  –  and   of them were male 
Most of these patients presented with dyspnea   cough   and fever  
  of the patients had a systolic blood pressure below   mm Hg at presentation 
   n     of all patients were mechanically ventilated during the hospitalization 
The median values of ferritin  D dimer  hs CRP  creatinine kinase and lactose dehydrogenase were elevated above their reference ranges  see online suppl

The development of AKI was seen earlier in the course in patients with an eGFR   mL min  m  at presentation   vs    and occurred within   h of admission 
Patients who developed AKI during the hospitalization were more likely to have a systolic blood pressure of   mm Hg at presentation and a lesser PF ratio and were more likely to be intubated during the course of hospitalization  Table  
Eighteen out of   patients with documented chronic kidney disease  CKD  prior to admission developed AKI during the hospitalization

This represented   of all patients and   of those with AKI 
All the patients who required RRT by definition had stage   AKI 
The modalities of RRT were continuous RRT in   patients   of all those who required RRT  and intermittent hemodialysis in   patients  
Two patients   required both modalities of RRT 
    out of   of those patients who required mechanical ventilation developed AKI compared with     out of   of nonventilated patients 
Of these   patients      required RRT 
The majority of AKI stage   patients requiring RRT were on mechanical ventilation   out of   requiring RRT 
  of the patients who were treated with RRT   out of   patients  died during the hospitalization 
Of those with stage   AKI who were not dialyzed    died

The in hospital mortality of AKI patients was     out of   who developed AKI died   Table  A significantly higher in hospital mortality was observed in patients with an eGFR   mL min  m  at presentation  elevated BUN at presentation  and in hospital AKI using the Kaplan Meier analysis  Fig

In a multivariable Cox PH model  adjusted for age  gender  PF ratio  hemodynamic status  and comorbidities  diabetes  HTN  hyperlipidemia  cancer  and stroke  eGFR   mL min  m  at presentation  BUN on admission  and AKI greater than or equal to stage   was associated with a higher risk of in hospital mortality 
There was no significant association between in hospital mortality and proteinuria and or hematuria  Table  AKI is common among hospitalized patients  incidence  –  and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality       
In our cohort of   COVID  patients  a relatively higher percentage of patients     of   developed in hospital AKI 
Current evidence suggests that AKI in COVID  patients is a result of an interplay of virus mediated injury  a dysregulated inflammatory response  angiotensin II pathway activation  hypercoagulation  and microangiopathy   
These COVID specific factors likely interact with the other known risk factors for AKI  such as hemodynamic instability  hypoxia  and sepsis  which increased over time 
The increase in the cumulative incidence of AKI over time in our cohort is likely associated with concomitant clinical deterioration and less likely represent a unique renal effect of COVID 
Compared to studies of AKI in COVID  patients from other countries  we found our incidence to be higher than that reported from   Asian countries  –  and is similar to that in an Italian study             
However  it is lower than that in the more recent report by Hirsch et al 
  who detailed their experience in   academic and community hospitals in metropolitan New York   none of which are located in the inner city  lower socioeconomic neighborhoods with a predominant minority population 
As compared with the above cited studies  the incidence of stage   AKI   was highest in our cohort 
It is not possible to determine with certainty the cause s  of this wide variation 
However  we did note a higher prevalence of comorbid conditions in our group 
For example  Cheng et al 
  reported a   incidence of AKI  with a   prevalence of HTN and a   prevalence of DM in their study population 
In our cohort  roughly twice as many   had HTN  and more than   times as many   were diabetic  Table  
Also  the incidence of severe lung involvement that required mechanical ventilation was lower   than ours    Table  
Mechanical ventilation per se has been reported to be strongly associated with AKI   
In our cohort  the incidence of AKI was also higher among those requiring mechanical ventilation  We identified various risk factors for AKI in our study  Tables    
Similar to previous reports  our patients with AKI were more likely to be male  have a history of HTN  and have severe respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation     
In our study  higher BMI increased the likelihood of developing severe AKI 
A low eGFR at presentation more than doubled the risk of developing AKI  p      Table  
Patients with lower eGFR had a significantly higher cumulative incidence of AKI than those with eGFR   mL min  m   p     Fig 
 
Thus  there was a synergistic effect of reduced baseline kidney function and subsequent AKI 
We did not find an association between diabetes and in hospital AKI The role of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors  ACEi  in COVID  is a subject of ongoing debate 
ACEi can increase the expression of ACE  the receptor used by SARS CoV  to enter target cells     
However  ACE  has been shown to be beneficial in acute respiratory distress syndrome when replaced     
This possible protective effect is attributed to the degradation of proinflammatory angiotensin II to angiotensin by ACE 
At present  it remains unclear if ACEi facilitate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus    SARS CoV  cellular entry and intracellular virus replication and whether ACEi improve acute respiratory distress syndrome outcomes 
In our cohort  the use of ACEi was significantly higher in patients with a lower admitting eGFR  Table   and in those who experienced AKI  Table  
We found a similar association between AKI and non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs  but not with angiotensin II receptor blockers  ARBs  in our cohort  Table  
Further studies are necessary to delineate the relationship between ACEi  angiotensin II receptor blockers  and COVID  outcomes Markers of acute inflammation  ferritin and CRP  muscle injury  creatinine kinase  myocardial injury  and D dimer levels were significantly higher in patients with a low eGFR at presentation  online suppl 
Table   and in those with AKI  online suppl 
Table   suggesting causality by a dysregulated immune inflammatory response  the so called  cytokine storm We found an extremely high incidence of mortality in our study cohort 
High presenting BUN and low eGFR   mL min  m  were significantly associated with increased mortality  Table  
AKI was significantly associated with increased mortality 
The mortality risk was highest in stage   AKI  HR   CI  –   Table  
Mortality was   in the AKI group and   in the non AKI group  p    
Mortality rose concurrently with the AKI stages      and   for stages     and   respectively  Table  
These rates were over   and  fold higher than those reported by Hirsch et al 
    AKI    in non AKI 
However  our cohort s high mortality is similar to the findings of John Hopkins University and the American Community Survey 
They reported a   and  fold higher COVID  infection and mortality rate in predominantly African American counties than in predominantly white counties   
Wadhera et al 
  also reported a death rate of   per   in Brooklyn  about   higher than that of Manhattan 
Moreover  in New York City  current age adjusted mortality is highest among African Americans and about   times that of whites   Our hospital provides medical services for an ethnic minority and a low income population in the most impoverished neighborhood in Brooklyn  where   of the residents live below the Federal Poverty Level as per a   report   
  of our patients identified themselves as African Americans 
In comparison  in the study by Hirsch et al 
     identified themselves as whites  and only   identified themselves as African Americans 
The high representation of ethnic minorities in our study population may have contributed to the increased mortality 
This association has been widely publicized and is likely the result of a complex interplay of multiple factors 
These include  but are not limited to  a high burden of comorbidities  genetics  the pernicious influence of adverse socioeconomic determinants of health  the absence of the privilege to work from home  and the ability to follow the recommended social distancing   In our cohort      of the   patients with AKI required RRT 
Nineteen out of these   patients   were mechanically ventilated 
Thus  almost all of the additional requirements for acute dialysis during the COVID  pandemic at our institution were in intensive care units 
Overall      out of   of mechanically ventilated patients required RRT 
Elevated ferritin was associated with an increased risk of all stages of AKI and the need for RRT  online suppl 
Table  
Among those who received RRT      died versus     in the stage   AKI group who did not undergo RRT  p      Table  
Thus  there was no statistically significant improvement in survival  and the mortality remained extremely high in both the RRT and non RRT groups 
These findings should prompt the early involvement of a palliative care team to define goals of care in patients with COVID  disease and stage   AKI In our experience  ultrafiltration was not well tolerated 
It often increased pressor requirements and did little to improve the ventilatory status 
We observed a high incidence of hypercoagulability and frequent clotting of the dialysis filters  lines  and catheters 
Thus  the patients required higher than the usual doses of heparin Our study has limitations 
Although     of the study population had a low eGFR on admission  only     had a documented history of CKD 
Data were collected retrospectively from medical records and often did not have information regarding prior renal function 
Patients also may have had an elevated creatinine on admission secondary to AKI suffered prior to hospitalization 
If so  we may have underestimated the true overall incidence of COVID associated AKI 
It is not possible to rectify this problem  given the data at our disposal Our study is a single center study  with the majority of the study population identifying themselves as African Americans or Hispanics 
This limits our study s general applicability but provides a unique insight into this population and broadens our understanding of COVID  disease 
Data were missing on many patients at different stages of the hospitalization since they were collected retrospectively 
Importantly  little data were available regarding urine output  a defining characteristic of AKI 
With this lack of information  we may have again underestimated the true incidence of AKI Nevertheless  even with the above limitations of our study  the high incidence of AKI and its negative impact upon survival is abundantly clear 
In response to the high incidence of AKI in our patients with COVID  we increased our capacity to deliver RRT 
These efforts included the purchase of additional machines and dialysis solutions  additional staff training  and engineering alterations to allow dialysis on the general medical floors 
Also  we increased our stockpiles of catheters  filters  and dialysis solutions for intermittent and continuous RRT 
We also plan to establish a peritoneal dialysis program to further strengthen our acute dialysis capacity In conclusion  our data report explicitly upon a high proportion of ethnic minority patients in an inner city  severely economically deprived neighborhood  previously not studied 
Our patients experienced a high incidence of AKI and an extremely high mortality  especially in AKI stage  
Unfortunately  RRT provided little survival benefit 
Policy changes and planning in preparation for this high incidence of AKI in COVID  patients are necessary at the local and national levels Study was approved by Institutional Review Board  IRB  Brookdale Hospital The authors have no conflicts of interests to declare The authors did not receive any funding U Z

  supervisor Dynamic changes in computed tomography manifestations of   patients
with novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan  ChinaDuring the first week of December   a few cases of pneumonia caused by a novel
coronavirus appeared in Wuhan  Hubei Province  China 
The patients had a history of
visiting the nearby Huanan seafood market  where wild animals were sold  With the spread of the disease  such cases have also been found in other
parts of China and abroad 
As of   July     cases have been confirmed
worldwide  including   deaths and   recoveries The novel coronavirus was originally named   novel coronavirus  nCoV  it was
recently officially renamed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus  
 SARS CoV  by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses 
The disease
caused by SARS CoV  has been named coronavirus disease    COVID  by the World
Health Organization 
Like SARS CoV  SARS CoV  likely originated in bats  however 
the intermediary animal host remains unclear 
The nearest neighbor of the  nCoV
isolates from China is a bat SARS like coronavirus  Bat SL CoVZC SARS CoV  carries a high risk of human to human transmission  and such transmission
has been reported in family clusters and among medical workers  The main route of transmission
is respiratory droplets and contact transmission  the virus may also be transmitted
through the conjunctiva and via aerosols  Current epidemiological surveys indicate that the latency period generally
ranges from   to   days  with a maximum of   days 
Affected patients present with
pneumonia like symptoms  including fever  fatigue  cough  expectoration 
pharyngalgia  anorexia  and myalgia 
Some patients also have gastrointestinal
symptoms  including diarrhea  nausea  vomiting  and abdominal pain 
In severe cases 
patients may rapidly develop acute respiratory distress syndrome  septic shock 
difficult to correct metabolic acidosis  and coagulation dysfunction Increasing numbers of studies are suggesting the high clinical value of imaging
examinations  especially high resolution computed tomography  HRCT  of the chest  in
patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia –  Typical CT imaging
manifestations include multiple patchy subsegmental or segmental ground glass
opacities  GGOs  and consolidation in the bilateral lungs  The imaging manifestations in patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia often
change rapidly  and many patients thus undergo repeated CT examinations 
Some
patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia gradually improve  whereas others develop
persistent hypoxemia or dyspnea and gradually worsen 
The changes in the patient s
condition are often closely related to the severity of the lung lesions 
Therefore 
observing the evolution of the lung lesions by chest CT is very important to assess
and predict the patient s outcome This study was to performed observe the changes in the chest HRCT manifestations of
  patients with pneumonia caused by SARS CoV  from the time of the initial
diagnosis 
To our knowledge  this is the largest population evaluated to date among
studies of the dynamic changes in imaging manifestations of novel coronavirus
pneumonia Consecutive patients were retrospectively enrolled in this single center study
from   January   to   February  
These patients met the Diagnosis and
Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia  trial version   issued by the National
Health Commission of the People s Republic of China  and their diagnoses were confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction 
According to the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus
Pneumonia  trial version   issued by the Chinese National Health Committee 
patients who developed severe pneumonia during their disease course were
excluded 
Severe pneumonia was defined as severe respiratory distress
 respiratory rate of   breaths minute  a requirement for oxygen treatment
or mechanical ventilation  an oxygen saturation of   on room air  a
partial arterial oxygen pressure fraction of inspired oxygen ratio of ≤  mmHg 
shock  or pneumonia combined with other organ failure All patients were examined using a Discovery CT  HD scanner  GE Healthcare 
Chicago  IL  USA  during a single inspiratory phase 
Before the examination  the
medical staff guided the patient to hold his or her breath and inhale 
After
complete exhalation  the patient held his or her breath  and a CT scan was
performed from the bottom of the lung to the apex of the lung 
The tube voltage
was   kVp with automatic tube current modulation 
The scan time was   s  the
scan interval was   mm  and the scan layer thickness was   mm 
After scanning 
adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction of   and the standard algorithm
were adopted  and the reconstruction layer thickness was   mm 
No contrast
agent was used during the CT scan 
Most patients underwent multiple chest CT
examinations  largely because the clinicians were still unclear about the
evolution tendencies of the lung lesions associated with COVID  pneumonia 
Additionally  some patients had symptoms such as hypoxemia or dyspnea due to
rapid disease progression 
Therefore  multiple chest CT examinations were
required to observe the progress or absorption of pneumonia The major CT manifestations were described using internationally standard
nomenclature defined by the Fleischner Society glossary  using terms such as
GGO  consolidation  and fibrous strips  A semi quantitative scoring system was used to estimate the pulmonary
involvement of all of these abnormalities on the basis of the area involved  Each of the five lung lobes was visually scored from   to   as follows 
  no involvement      involvement      to   involvement      to
  involvement      to   involvement  and     involvement 
The
total CT score was the sum of the individual lobar scores and ranged from    no
involvement  to    maximum involvement 
The number of affected lung lobes was
also recorded 
The images were transferred to an AW  workstation  GE
Healthcare  and anonymized 
All images were evaluated by two radiologists with
more than   years of work experience  and the final scores were determined by
consensus Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS Statistics for Windows  Version
   SPSS Inc  Chicago  IL  USA 
Measurement data are expressed as
mean   standard deviation  minimum–maximum  and categorical data are presented
as the percentage of the group 
A P value of   was defined as
statistically significant In total    CT scans of   patients   men    women  with confirmed COVID 
were collected 
The patients  ages ranged from   to   years  and their mean
age was       years 
Fever was the most common symptom  Table  
The patients
underwent        –  chest CT examinations  and the interval between the
first and last scan was       days  –  days The laboratory results are presented in Table  
Most laboratory results were
normal  with mildly elevated concentrations of C reactive protein
      mg L  D dimers       mg L  and ferritin      
µg L Based on clinical experience  five stages were identified from the onset of
initial symptoms  Stage A  –  days  n     Stage B  –  days  n     Stage
C  –  days  n     Stage D  –  days  n     and Stage E   days 
n    
One patient had a  day history of cough with fever and was in Stage B
at the time of admission 
The frequencies of different lesions in different
stages are presented in Table  
Two patients in Stage A and one patient in Stage E had no
lesions 
Multiple lobes were involved in most of the CT scans in all stages 
Multiple lobe involvement was present in     patients in Stage A   
  in Stage B      in Stage C      in Stage D  and    
in Stage E  GGOs could be seen in all stages  and the proportion of GGOs in each
stage was similar 
The proportion of consolidation first increased and then
decreased over time 
GGOs and consolidation were present in     and  
  patients in Stage A      and     in Stage B     
and     in Stage C      and     in Stage D  and    
and     in Stage E  respectively 
The consolidations in some cases were
absorbed As shown in Table  
the total CT score also first increased and then decreased over time  and the
total CT score of pulmonary involvement was significantly higher in Stage B than
in Stage A       vs        respectively  P    
Additionally  the
total CT score of lung involvement was significantly higher in Stage C than in
Stages B and D       vs         P     and       vs       
 P     respectively 
The number of involved lobes was significantly higher
in Stage B than in Stage A       vs        respectively  P    
Notably  the CT score of the lower lobe was significantly higher than the
corresponding upper and middle lobes in Stages A  B  C  and D  P     for
all 
In Stage E  the CT score of the right lower lobe was significantly higher
than that of the right upper middle lobes  P     and P    
respectively  whereas no significant difference was observed in the CT score
between the left lower lobe and left upper lobe The CT images of a patient with novel coronavirus pneumonia are shown in Figure  
GGOs and
consolidation first increased from Stage A to Stage C  after which the
consolidation gradually absorbed  the GGOs then gradually decreased in Stages D
and E Since the end of   an outbreak of a novel pneumonia in Wuhan has been drawing
tremendous attention around the world 
Chinese government officials and researchers
have taken swift measures to control the outbreak and conduct etiological studies 
The causative agent of this pneumonia has been identified as SARS CoV  a novel
coronavirus 
As its name suggests  its genetic structure is   similar to that of SARS CoV The most frequently affected organ of the novel coronavirus is the lung 
In the
previous version of the diagnosis and treatment guideline for pneumonia caused by
novel coronavirus  the diagnosis was confirmed by the presence of viral nucleic
acids in throat swabs  sputum  and alveolar lavage fluid 
However  the more recent
guideline indicates that if typical chest CT findings are observed in patients
suspected to have COVID  the patient should be clinically diagnosed 
This
reflects the important role of chest CT in the diagnosis 
Moreover  current clinical
experience is showing that the chest CT manifestations change rapidly 
Therefore 
many patients in the present study underwent multiple repeated examinations during
treatment 
To our knowledge  this study is by far the largest case series of
follow up imaging among patients with COVID SARS CoV  infects human respiratory epithelial cells through S protein and has a
strong infection capacity for humans 
Coronavirus particles have a diameter of   to
  nm and can directly reach the bottom of the lung 
Because of lung volume and
gravity  respiratory airflow  and other factors  the type II alveolar epithelial
cells present at the bottom of the lung become the target cells of the coronavirus 
Therefore  the lesions are mainly distributed under the pleura or along the vascular
bronchial bundle  After the alveolar epithelial cells have become combined with the virus  the
alveolar wall is damaged and large numbers of immune cells and lymphocytes
accumulate  resulting in swelling around the lung leaflets and blood vessel
congestion 
The pulmonary lobules merge with each other  forming nodular or patchy
GGOs 
As the disease progresses  multiple lung segments become involved  the scope
of the lesion expands  the alveolar wall shrinks and collapses  and the exfoliated
and necrotic epithelium and the exuded inflammatory cells form a hyaline membrane 
These changes manifest as coexisting imaging abnormalities such as GGOs  nodules 
consolidation  and fibrous cord strips Several studies have focused on the evolution of CT changes in patients with COVID 
pneumonia 
Pan et al  analyzed the disease course according to  day stages and found that the CT
score was the highest on days   to   of the disease course  after   days  the CT
score of the lower lung was significantly higher than that of the middle and upper
lungs 
Zhou et al  found that CT images of patients with COVID  pneumonia showed a
predominantly peripheral  middle  lower  and posterior distribution 
The early rapid
progressive stage was   to   days from symptom onset  the advanced stage with peak
levels of CT abnormalities occurred from   to   days  and the abnormalities started
to improve after   days 
Lei et al  reported that patients with COVID  pneumonia had a typical transition from
the early stage to the advanced stage and then from the advanced stage to the
dissipating stage 
Single or multiple GGOs were distributed along the
bronchovascular or subpleural regions in the pulmonary parenchyma in the early
stage  higher density consolidations were observed in the advanced stage  and the
GGOs and consolidations were absorbed in the dissipating stage 
Xiang et al  evaluated only six patients with COVID  pneumonia and reported that the CT
score peaked at   to   days and that the CT scores of the lower lobes were
significantly higher than those of the middle upper lobes after   days from disease
onset 
These findings were consistent with those reported by Pan et al  Liang et al  reported that the majority of patients had involvement of three or more
lobes 
Bilateral involvement was more prevalent than unilateral involvement 
The
proportions of patients observed to have pure GGOs or GGOs and consolidation
decreased over time  while the proportion of patients with GGOs and linear opacities
increased 
The total severity score showed an increasing trend in the first   weeks 
Bernheim et al  divided the disease course into three stages  –   –  and  –  days  and
found that   of patients in the first stage had normal CT findings 
As the time
since onset of symptoms increased  the CT abnormalities became more frequent  these
findings included consolidation  bilateral and peripheral disease  greater total
lung involvement  linear opacities  the  crazy paving  pattern  and the  reverse
halo  sign In this study  we evaluated the CT findings of   patients with COVID  pneumonia
confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction 
The patients underwent
a mean of        range   –  chest CT examinations 
At present  the course of
COVID  pneumonia and when patients should be re examined remain inconclusive 
As
mentioned above  different studies have staged the disease according to different
time periods 
We grouped the patients  CT scans at different time intervals 
The
time interval grouping was based on current clinical experience and is consistent
with the imaging interval described in the pneumonia diagnosis and treatment guidelines  This grouping is also partially similar to that described by Pan et al  and Zhou et al  Multiple lobe involvement was observed in most patients in all stages  and
lower lobe lesions were significantly more common than upper and middle lobe
lesions  this is also consistent with the findings reported by Pan et al  and Liang et al  As mentioned above  most studies have suggested that patients with COVID 
pneumonia undergo a typical transition from the early stage to the advanced stage
and then from the advanced stage to the dissipating stage  however  the time to
reach the peak of the disease course varies among different studies  and the
patients in our study showed a similar tendency 
GGOs and consolidation were the
common chest CT manifestations  the proportion of GGOs in each stage was similar 
while consolidation and the total CT score first increased and then decreased over
time 
The total CT score was significantly higher in Stage B than in Stage A  while
the total CT score was significantly higher in Stage C than in Stage B 
These
findings suggest that the lung lesions of most patients significantly improved after
  days and that most patients with new coronavirus pneumonia had a disease course
of more than   days This study had three main limitations 
First  we did not consider the effects of
factors such as age  sex  medical history  including hypertension  hyperlipidemia 
hyperglycemia  and malignant tumors  and lifestyle habits  including smoking and
drinking history  on patient outcomes 
Second  although   patients with novel
coronavirus pneumonia were included in this study  the number of patients in Stages
B to E was limited 
Future studies should include more patients and extend the
observation time to ensure that the study results are more representative 
Third 
some studies have suggested that factors such as age  the C reactive protein
concentration  and the interleukin  β concentration may be related to patient
outcomes 
However  we did not perform a correlation analysis between the laboratory
data and patient outcomes In conclusion  we followed up and evaluated   chest CT scans of   patients with
confirmed COVID  pneumonia and found that most patients had a disease course of
more than   days and that the lung lesions of most patients improved significantly
after   days 
The purpose of this study is to help clinicians better understand the
disease course and properly perform chest CT re examinations for patients with
COVID  pneumonia to minimize the radiation dose Transdermal Delivery Systems for BiomoleculesDrug delivery is related to many problems focused on the molecular stability  pharmacokinetic  and amphoteric nature of a substance 
Due to chemical instability and high degradation by enzymatic action regardless of the distance to the specific target organ  all of this is more complicated when the bioactive substance that is intended to be administered is a biomolecule  such as peptides and proteins   Currently  there is a system that is applied to the protein drug delivery  which is a non conventional system developed primarily for protein and peptide drug delivery 
This new delivery system has a higher efficiency that improves the passage of the protein drug to the skin   
The transdermal drug delivery  TDD  system reduces potential exposure to side effects in the host and improves protein stability by also reducing enzymatic degradation  which is very common to occur when a drug takes the most conventional routes to enter the body  such as oral and subcutaneous routes 
Mainly  TDD systems avoid the first pass of metabolism  which occurs in the liver   
The protein and peptide drugs are important in many innovative treatments  such as immunotherapy  where biomolecules  such as antibodies  growth factors  and interleukins  are used 
These are proteins with high susceptibility to degradation to many endogenous and exogenous factors  such as temperature and pH  and most importantly  enzymatic degradation and immune clearance One of the most important advantages of the transdermal route is to maintain drug release in a constant and prolonged release to achieve optimal blood circulation concentrations   
For transdermal protein drug delivery systems  specific methods or devices are used to allow or enhance intact passage through the stratum corneum  SC 
The most suitable systems for the release of biomolecules are the third generation transdermal delivery systems  whose effects are directed to the SC 
For TDD systems of biomolecules and vaccines  thermal ablation and microneedles are the most widely used physical penetration enhancers 
However  there are many other systems that have been tested for transdermal release of biomolecules   that have been included in the second and third generation of transdermal delivery systems  such as iontophoresis and electroporation This article highlights the main technologies used as tools that improve transdermal protein drug delivery systems  addressing them from the point of view of research in the development of transdermal systems where many technologies and devices have a high possibility of use in conventional drug treatments  such as nanotechnology devices 
The authors provide an overview of the various systems that exist in TDD that have been tested and proposed for the transdermal delivery of biomolecules The skin is a three layer laminate that is made up of the SC  the epidermis  and the dermis   
The epidermis is the outermost layer and is formed from the stratified epithelium  the stratum germinativum  spinosum  granulosum  lucidum  and corneum   Fig 
 The SC is the outermost and impermeable skin layer that prevents the entry of most chemicals   
This barrier is formed by around   to   lines of dead keratinocytes  corneocytes  that have united with each other with corneodesmosomes forming a wall embedded in a lipidic matrix 
The extracellular matrix is formed by lipids  such as fatty acids  ceramides  cholesterol  cholesterol sulfate  and sterol wax esters arranged in lamellae  and multiple lipid bilayers  although the matrix is primarily composed of ceramides     
Corneocytes contain involucrin  loricrin  and cornifin around their periphery and have a thickness of   μm  but this can be modified by factors such as hydration and the anatomic site of the skin   
This stratum contains high amounts of keratin inside the corneocytes  and the keratin filaments provide the hexagonal shape and stratum mechanical strength of the corneocyte   
In addition  the SC acts as a barrier  preventing desiccation and pathogen entry and protecting against ultraviolet rays 
The SC also plays an important role in wound repair The transdermal delivery route has been used many times for the local application of therapeutic substances  and it is a practice that is still used and that will continue to grow in the coming years The transdermal drug delivery systems also allow homogeneous absorption and have good pharmaceutical efficiency  reducing the adverse effects that drugs could cause in the host and reduce the drug risk to suffer alterations caused by enzymatic factors and the immune system present in the intrinsic environment 
Besides that  these systems are more comfortable for the patient   This method is formed by steps that start when the therapeutic molecule enters the skin until it enters the blood circulation 
The first step is penetration  which occurs when the drug is deposited onto the specific skin layer 
Later  the permeation step occurs when the molecule diffuses from one layer to another 
Finally  in the resorption process  the drug enters the bloodstream     This type of drug delivery system has advantages over traditional systems because it can allow the storage of small amounts of drugs in the transport and delivery structure  which are developed by nanotechnology using mainly polymeric nanomaterials made with biopolymers  microneedles  and nanoparticles With these devices  it is possible to improve drug delivery and its bioavailability 
Thus  it is possible to reduce the frequency between drug administrations 
The most innovative property is that the device is only replaced when the dose is finished and it can take several days     
The exact side effects that they could trigger are unknown  since they could mainly depend on the type of bioactive drug it contains  which could be related to some effects of the mechanical properties of the skin    Table  Peptides and proteins have long been important resources in the treatment of many diseases 
Many of the therapies that are applied for many diseases have recently used peptides and proteins  which is called biological therapy and focuses on the production of the main proteins obtained from living organisms such as transforming bacteria The main diseases which are treated with proteins are diabetes  hemophilia  infectious diseases  and anemia 
These therapeutic proteins are primarily hormones  interleukins  anticoagulants  and enzymes  which are recombinant proteins 
Other protein drugs  such as calcitonin  rituximab  gemtuzumab  insulin  epidermal growth factor  and interferons  are best known for their importance in the treatment of osteoporosis  lymphoma  leukemia  and diabetes mellitus   The most employed biological protein therapy is immunotherapy  which has several applications 
One of the most important applications is cancer treatment  which is a specific treatment that employs cytokines  a kind of protein produced by the immunity system that helps the patient s immune system eliminate cancer cells and prevents the replication of cancer cells 
These immune proteins are classified in therapeutic groups known as cytokines  monoclonal antibodies  tyrosine kinase inhibitor  and rapamycin receptor inhibitors in mammals  mTOR    
Two main kinds of cytokines are the most importantly used in biological therapies  interleukins and interferons 
Production is carried out with laboratory animals and once extracted and purified  they are used by injection into a human recipient for clinical treatment  e g  monoclonal antibodies 
However  there are many applications for products  such as antibodies obtained from live organisms and these are used mainly for the prevention of diseases such as in the development of vaccines 
The most important pharmaceutical products are listed in Table     Each one of these peptides or proteins has a different method of administration  such as intravenous  oral  topical  or intravesical 
Some other proposed methods of administration that would avoid the difficulties of the route of administration and offer comfort to the user include the nasal  pulmonary  ocular  and rectal routes    which could be as invasive as the traditional routes in many cases 
The main drawback of this type of therapies is that traditional administration such as subcutaneous injection and intravenous administration can modify their effectiveness  since the route of administration may vary in different clinical circumstances  for example  it may contribute to an increase in blood pressure   When any substance  including proteins  enters the bloodstream regardless of the route of administration  these proteins are exposed to many environmental threats such as sequestration by the reticuloendothelial system mainly for macrophage internalization  enzymatic degradation and absorption and elimination of serum proteins by the liver  –   which is an important factor to consider  since it represents a low efficiency in the application of biological therapy due to its high rate of degradation and elimination   
In addition to protecting the lability of all therapeutic proteins  it is also about preventing them from exerting their activity in places that do not require it 
Although immunotherapy is more effective and less toxic than therapies made with chemical molecules  these immune proteins also trigger adverse effects in the host  such as autoimmunities and non specific inflammatory processes   
For these reasons  research is being carried out on the use of alternative technologies with which these side effects can be controlled  such as with the use of nanotechnology using polymers  with which these proteins can be protected  favoring their transport and direct delivery to their objective  preventing them from exerting their toxic effect on non specific cells and sites   Nanocarriers  such as nanotubes    microneedles  MNs   –   fusion peptide carriers    or peptide conjugated nanoparticles  NPs      are some of the main carriers and protective systems used in immunotherapy  regardless of the size or structure of the molecule to be transported and protected  which could be genetic material  interferon  interleukins  or antibodies In   the US FDA approved the use of TDD systems and their use has been increasing in relevance for protein drugs because for some molecules these delivery systems improve the solubility of the compound  in addition to allowing it to pass efficiently through the skin There are important findings in research revealing that TDD technologies allow the loading  transport  and release of protein drugs 
They are very promising for the effective treatment of local cancers  with skin location  and they have a second benefit of activating the immune system from a remote distance 
Some of them have been developed to carry ribonucleic acid  RNA  that can regulate localized gene expression within a known target 
In other cases  it is possible to use an immunologic protein that could produce a strong adaptive immune response against a specific antigen in the case of vaccines  where it could be made with the tumor antigen expressed in the gene  tumor related protein or peptide  specific epitope  or cell lysate   For immunotherapy  it might be possible to employ monoclonal antibody loaded TDD systems and tumor agnostic therapies  non specific immunotherapies  use of interferons and interleukins  and cancer theranostic treatment where SC could be interrupted by a nanogel delivering a drug through the skin and allowing it to accumulate at the tumor site   or these systems may even function by delivering vaccine antigens  cancer vaccines  using nanoparticles and liposomes as antigenic carriers loaded on nanogels to pass the antigen through the SC by iontophoresis   
It is also possible to use microneedles loaded with Dermatophagoides farinae extract to achieve effective allergen release and effective immune response induction   These strategies have a wide range of application in various skin pathological circumstances  in addition to their main role in cancer therapy  and many products are used for the treatment of cancer 
Some of the commercial pharmaceutical products used for cancer therapy  which are administered transdermally  are described in Table     Through the use of transdermal delivery systems  it is sought to increase the solubility and stability  the circulating life  and the pharmacokinetic properties of drug proteins and peptides 
It is recommended to consider that the TDD system is not applicable to many of the biomolecules that are used as medical treatments since the success in the transdermal passage could depend on certain factors 
The efficacy of this therapeutic system depends both on the physical and chemical properties of the proteins and on the percutaneous administration systems of biomolecules to be used 
Regarding protein  the main physical properties to consider are the shape and size  molecular weight  solubility  and amphoteric nature  the latter being perhaps one of the most important to consider since due to its amphoteric property it can migrate in an electric field and its migration direction depends on the net charge that it has 
The knowledge of this property could help to elucidate which are the best percutaneous administration systems to facilitate passage through the SC 
In the case of charged proteins  physical  electrical  enhancers are the best option to use 
The chemical nature of proteins is another especially important factor to know 
This composition could help us to choose the best TDD system through which the protein will pass through the SC avoiding the reactivity of some functional groups of proteins 
For these reasons  there is little increase in the development of new therapeutic formulations administered by TDD systems  since there are some protein properties that need to be studied and analyzed to know if they can be administered by this route without affecting its stability and pharmacokinetic properties Peptides are molecules that have a molecular weight between   Da and   kDa 
This molecular weight depends on the molecular structures and their lengths with a small amount of amino acids or constitutes a protein with a complex structure 
These molecules are charged in a physiological pH and are hydrophilic  which complicates their permeability across the skin 
Some drugs have a lower or higher affinity with the lipophilic condition of the SC  which determines the quantity of the molecule that can cross this layer of the skin naturally 
Therefore  it is better to use a technique that improves passage to the skin  using or not natural permeation molecular routes avoiding the degradation of peptides or proteins and ensuring passage and integrity during the transport and release processes   There are important skin conditions that can change permeability  such as age  heat  racial differences  freezing  abrasion  chemical irritant activity  and some diseases such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis 
It is very important to recognize these for the development and use of devices employed in transdermal protein drug delivery In the skin  three molecular permeation routes are the most important  intracellular  intercellular  and follicular routes 
All of these are beneficiated by the concentration gradient of the molecules present in the milieu  allowing passive diffusion across the SC   
Moreover  physicochemical properties from the molecule affect its passage through the SC 
Hydrophobic molecules can cross the SC intercellularly  whereas hydrophilic molecules cross intracellularly by corneocytes 
Passage through the skin can take place through so called cutaneous defects  in which the skin has a discontinuity  such as sweat glands or hair shafts   In the skin  the SC and lipid layers have a barrier function  as both prevent the loss of water and avoid the entry of any substances  molecules  or microorganisms from the environment or microbiome 
These layers play a crucial role in the passive passage of proteins and other chemicals into the skin 
The liquid flux between the lipid layer depends on the lamellar and linear lipid matrix arrangement 
The lamellar layer is generally oriented parallel to the SC  and linear lipids are perpendicular to the SC 
If no long periodicity phase  LPP  exists  the permeability increases   
However  if the orthorhombic phase  OP  predominates  the permeability of the lipids is reduced  and if the OP predominates in the lateral layer  the permeation decreases   
The LPP is primarily formed by ceramides  cholesterol  and free fatty acids  and these have a unique tri layer organization  while an all trans chain lipid organization exists in the OP phase  which has a rectangular crystalline lattice and no mobility Transdermal drug delivery has been used for many years  and the skin was thought to be impervious to exogenous chemical molecules 
Currently  it is known that the skin is a semi permeable barrier  which allows its use as a transport route for molecules  allowing the molecule to reach the therapeutic target intact 
However  due to its anatomy  hydrophilic molecules can only pass through the skin if they are small  and even then  in many cases  they require help from an electric field  electrotherapies  as in the case of electroporation   and iontophoresis   
These techniques use a low voltage supplementation  direct current  around the drug site  allowing and enhancing passage through the skin   
When an electric field is applied to the skin  a large molecular movement occurs and the molecule can take the path of the hair follicle through the skin or induce pore formation     There is another technology using acoustic transmission  sonophoresis  that is used in medical trials  such as hyperthermia treatment  physical therapy  and ultrasonic surgery  which has the ability to facilitate drug transport to the skin   
Through this technique  mechanical waves of medium or low frequency are transferred to a physical medium  such as a specific gel  which allows it to propagate and transmit energy 
In the ultrasonic system  wave sounds have an oscillation frequency greater than   kHz   The TDD systems are an alternative route that allows the control of the drug release and decreases the possibility of any side effects associated with levels that are higher than the minimum pharmacological concentration  reducing pharmacological dosing times because a patch is administered every   to   h  This eliminates the risk of metabolism of the therapeutic agent and the loss of the available dose 
In addition  there are other advantages  such as the noninvasive drug delivery method  which can be discontinued at any time   
To facilitate TDD to improve SC permeation  some technologies improve drug flux of difficult drugs    such as cryioneumatic and photpneumatic technologies  sonphoresis  iontophoresis  electroporation  jet injection  and MN  which are used in the delivery of many drugs   The disadvantage in the above cases is that all devices require a low voltage supplement 
In addition  it is necessary to purchase equipment to manage the electrical current 
In addition  in some people it can cause sensitivity  such as tingling and irritation  and the technique can even cause blistering of the skin 
In these cases  when the technique is not well applied  it can cause burns to the skin 
In all circumstances  these techniques must be applied by trained personnel Despite these drawbacks  considerable research has been focused on the transport of peptides through the skin with good results 
In Table   we list some examples of these studies  the biomolecules and penetration enhancers  and the main result of each 
The table also indicates whether the physical penetration enhancer acts alone or is enhanced by a combination with another enhancer or nanocarrier    –  Many compounds have been employed to improve the penetration of substances across the skin  such as azone  pyrrolidones  alkanols  sulfoxides  glycols  alcohols  and surfactants   
Each of the chemical penetration enhancers has a specific action mechanism in the skin penetration process Due to the characteristics of the upper layer of the skin  which is specialized in avoiding and preventing the entry of any molecule or pathogen  the SC is complicated in terms of the passage of molecules greater than   Da  but it is not impossible 
In many cases  this process can be carried out using penetration enhancer molecules  which have good results in terms of penetration of molecules through the skin 
However  it represents a disadvantage because it could permit not only pathogens but also microorganisms in the cutaneous microbiota to enter as a consequence of cellular disruption integrity and the focal detachment of superficial corneocytes  such as in the use of thioglycolate in depilatory treatments   
The process of percutaneous absorption of a therapeutic molecule consists of several processes  which include the dissolution and release of the therapeutic agent  partition and diffusion within the SC  partition from the SC to the aqueous phase of the epidermis and its diffusion  and finally  access to the systemic circulation and target tissue There are three routes through which any molecule can breach this and reach the microcirculation through the tissue 
These are the intercellular  transcellular  and transappendageal routes  but the route can depend on the drug s molecular weight  Fig 
    Chemical penetration enhancers are a good alternative to allow the passage of biomolecules  but most of them cause skin irritation  which is uncomfortable for patients   
In many cases  the penetration enhancers have synergic activity when they are used in combination    but they can generate more skin irritation problems 
The mode of action of these enhancers is different for each one and depends on the mechanism by which it interacts with the compounds of the SC 
Due to this capacity  it has been classified according to their interaction ability in those that  a  interact with lipid heads within aqueous domains of the lipid bilayers and interact with the lipid alkyl chain   b  interact with actin filaments in the corneocytes   c  allow partitioning augmentation and increase drug protein solubility in the SC  and  d  improve penetration indirectly  modifying the drug  Fig 
    
Some of the most studied chemical penetration enhancers are the terpenes  amide  fatty acids  monoglycerides  and surfactants  and some of the most commonly studied are  D limonene  azone  lauric acid  monoolein and sodium lauryl sulfate   Depending on their chemical structure  some polymers can transport drug molecules within their structure  as in the case of cyclodextrins and their derivatives together with other saccharides  moieties  that can transport drugs as ketoprofen   or biomolecules such as levothyroxine sodium  T  which has been used as a topical treatment to eliminate lipid deposits in subcutaneous adipose tissue 
The main problem with this type of application has been the IT  detection in rabbits   h after the application of the cream 
The use of dimethyl cyclodextrin as a solubilizer for levothyroxine increased its solubility  but unfortunately  it only succeeded in penetrating much less levothyroxine through the skin than the required dose in humans   
In this way  it is important to highlight that the complex improves the solubility of the molecule allowing it to pass through the SC  and in another specific treatment  it could recognize a specific target in the cell plasma membrane and then adhere to it and release its content in a more efficient way Proteins are a substantial problem when we try to pass them through the skin 
First  they are larger  and second  they are highly susceptible to enzymatic degradation 
Not all are thermostable  and finally  another difficulty is that proteins and peptides live for a short time in plasma 
For this  it is necessary to protect them during their trip to the place of action 
Furthermore  this protection enables controlled delivery 
Passing through the skin can be less difficult if the protein is in a capsule  which is best when the capsule size is in the nanometric range Advances in the science of polymers applied in pharmacy have allowed the development of many encapsulation techniques that range from the most impractical to the most revolutionary methods 
However  this reveals a problem  as some polymers are not soluble in water and require organic solvents 
Furthermore  the integrity of the protein to be encapsulated is compromised regardless of the encapsulation technique Many types of polymers could be used in drug delivery  however  their chemical structure and molecular weight do not allow dissolution in water in many cases  and most dissolve well in organic solvents 
The solubility of the polymer is a characteristic that is important to determine before use because it can determine the environmental resistance in the process in which it will be used Biopolymers and their combinations are best used for these procedures  helping to improve the stability of the formulation as in the case of encapsulating transforming growth factor  TGF β  in poly d l lactic co glycolic acid   PLGA  and polyethylene glycol  PEG  polymeric microparticles for bone regeneration   
Insulin loaded PCL PEG PCL NPs are another example where the NPs were prepared by the w o w double emulsion solvent evaporation method and demonstrated satisfactory insulin delivery and efficacy in treating diabetic rats   
These NPs possess a specific protein drug delivery with a delivery degradation speed 
They are hydrophobic or hydrophilic according to what is necessary for the encapsulation procedure and for improvement in the stability of the protein drug 
They have a low or no chance of rejection and are safe to use Encapsulation processes are classified into two types  chemical and mechanical  which are then classified according to the methodology used to make the capsule 
This can be determined according to the desired size  shape  and composition surface chemistry 
The encapsulation of biomolecules by these methods allows us to avoid the degradation of the free protein and allows the prolonged and constant release of a protein drug in constant time     With these methods  it is possible to obtain nano sized particles  which are especially important to avoid their elimination by the immune system and the liver   
Smaller and softer particles can better evade the immune system  and this can be compatible with the recipient organism 
It is important to note that capsules with a diameter size of ≤  μm have the risk of being engulfed by phagocytic immune cells  therefore  the recommended NP size that could have an appropriate delivery range is   to   nm   Dendrimers are three dimensional NPs  like macromolecules  and are considered based on nanometric size 
These are radially symmetric and comprise an inner core structure made up of a central atom covalently bonded between other atoms 
The external composition is highly branched  forming a dendrimer structure 
These branches allow the formation of cavities into which bioactive molecules   can be incorporated  such as proteins   and peptides used for many pathological treatments   and for storage  transport  and controlled delivery There are many types of dendrimer structures  and depending on the synthesis method  these methods could use click chemistry   and divergent and convergent strategies 
In addition  there are different designs and chemical elements 
Their application in the administration of drugs has focused on the fact that these have many biocompatible characteristics 
These characteristics include non immunogenicity  non toxicity  and a high ability to cross biological barriers  such as cell membranes  blood vessels  intestines  and the blood brain barrier   In addition  they have high stability in blood circulation and a prolonged blood circulation half life  and they target specific structures 
These NPs can be manufactured in high purity and have some degree of in vitro toxicity when manufactured with cationic and anionic surface groups 
However  it is possible to reduce this toxicity by using surface protection by PEGs or fatty acids   In TDD systems  dendrimers have been employed for the penetration of nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs  such as indomethacin  which is an arthritis and osteoarthritis auxiliary drug in the treatment of the pain generated from this disease 
There is a study that reports the progress of the TAT PAMAM dendrimer system developed as a non viral vector for the transdermal release of DNA plasmids where the dendrimer system was modified 
The HIV transcriptional transactivator  TAT  was conjugated as a cell penetrating peptide to enhance the uptake of constructed plasmid DNA pIRES H GFP by cells   
Dendrimers are an excellent drug penetration enhancer   and they are some of the best nanostructures that have high applicability in medicine for the delivery of peptides and proteins As mentioned  traditional routes  intradermal  gastric  or intravenous  have long been the main delivery route for all drugs 
Nevertheless  the appearance of an increase in chronic diseases has allowed the development of new technologies that are less invasive and have high efficiency upon reaching the target  especially in cases in which a user must take more than one medicine for the treatment of one or more diseases at a time Although the design and use of MNs can ensure the entrance of molecules across the skin  biomolecules have a high degradation risk that can occur at any time  in the charging process or at the moment of release 
Thus  it is better to protect the protein contained within a specialized structure  such as nanocapsules or dendrimers  NPs in both cases 
This procedure has no danger for the protein or peptide structural composition  which improves the conservation and passage of these compositions across the SC  Fig 
 The PLGA NPs can go through SC better with the help of MNs because the micro conduits created by these needles allow the NPs to avoid the SC barrier and arrive at other skin layers and deliver the complete contents  Fig 
    
For this procedure  it is necessary to consider that  in all cases  the penetration capacity of NPs depends on the particle and channel size   
Despite this important consideration  among others  the procedure also avoids the limitations of the skin s physicochemical properties that do not permit crossing it Some experimental studies have demonstrated the penetration and distribution of PLGA NPs in MNs   
The most common use of NPs MNs is for experimental insulin release systems using murine models in rats with induced diabetes  where the insulin is introduced into H O responsive mesoporous silica NPs  and MN patches are manufactured for later transdermal application 
Its release behavior analysis demonstrated effective release   
For immunity induction  an excellent response occurs when the NPs MNs were employed 
For example  for the induction of immunity against endogenous prostate cancer stem cell antigen RALA pPSCA  the immunization via the NP MN release system resulted in anti tumor activity in both cases of prophylactic and treatment assays in vivo   
Another experimental process that allows probing the system efficacy is the use of poly methylmethacrylate  coated with   nm of gold NPs  which has great potential in tumoral cell destruction   Currently  there are few authorized devices  however  these are increasing because for many treatments  such devices are more appropriately used  effective  and exhibit more recommended results 
Perhaps shortly  these devices will be the most appropriate techniques for drug and protein delivery systems For many decades  a great number of therapies to resolve the problems associated with drug release have been implicated to probe numerous kinds of devices and pharmaceutical innovations to solve many diseases or applications in various clinical trials for the diagnosis of diseases or treatments of diseases 
For this application  it is necessary to design new technologies  and pharmaceutical chemistry has been concerned with offering the best administration methods for therapeutic agents Lately  many research studies have reported numerous results that indicate the most appropriate technologies to use in each case of a drug delivery system

Measurements were performed in duplicate The importance of feedback for surgical teams during the COVID  pandemic
Editor
As new research has emerged about COVID  transmission  personal protective equipment  PPE  and patient management guidelines have evolved 
This has led to rapid guideline changes within healthcare systems 
Conflicting guidelines can contribute to miscommunication  increased stress  and reduced cohesion among surgical teams 
To successfully implement new guidelines during times of crisis  specific and timely feedback can be used to identify and resolve breaches in infection control  and promote feelings of support among healthcare workers Although inherently less complex than live surgery  feedback in stressful simulated scenarios can provide information about common pitfalls and provide a safe environment in which to practice new skills 
Our group found that when under stress  mental practice coaching combined with feedback significantly enhanced performance compared to simulation alone by better preparing individuals to execute action 
Feedback and mental rehearsal can help improve individuals  knowledge of guidelines and confidence in their abilities to perform under stress 
Critical skills to master in this new environment include PPE donning and doffing  performing procedures on COVID positive patients while in PPE  and new workflow protocols Within normal workflow  new technical skills and adherence to new operative safety protocols may be improved by video based feedback 
In a randomized study  coached trainees using video feedback made approximately half the number of technical errors when compared with those receiving conventional training 
This coaching has been extremely well received when implemented in multidisciplinary teams 
Non technical performance can also be improved through structured curricula combined with debriefing and feedback Under the best of circumstances  it can be challenging to provide the feedback necessary to maintain and improve individual and team performance 
Our team developed the operating room  OR  Black Box®  Surgical Safety Technologies  Inc    a technology that continuously captures and synchronizes multiple sources of intraoperative video and audio data 
Postoperatively  analysts identify safety threats and resilience supports that may respectively contribute to  or help to avoid adverse events  so targeted interventions can be implemented to promote patient safety 
Over the last ten years  our group has researched effective ways to reduce surgical error and optimize surgical safety using feedback – To address the need for feedback during the COVID pandemic at our institution  we developed the COVID Black Box 
Data from simulation scenarios on COVID positive patients recorded via the COVID Black Box is assessed to detect breaches in infection control practices  and identify suboptimal performance for improvement 
Specific and timely feedback is provided to equip OR personnel on how to correct misinformation  improve responses  and facilitate behavioural change on an operative team level 
Although formal analysis has yet to be conducted  qualitative downstream effects of feedback observed include an increased sense of control  reduced stress  improved team communication  feelings of managerial support  and more positive attitudes indicative of the organizational safety culture During this global pandemic  hospitals and surgical departments should not underestimate the importance of providing their teams with feedback 
Hospitals without comprehensive recording capabilities should establish systematic methods of providing feedback to OR teams such as video recording operations or assigning dedicated observers to record breaches in safety practices 
This feedback should be presented to surgical teams immediately and continuously  and collated for the larger institution on a regular basis to transparently communicate lessons learned from previous surgical cases 
Specific and timely feedback may reduce preventable errors in surgery during the pressures of the pandemic 
With ongoing effort to support our surgical teams and better performance  we can help our front line OR staff and patients during both the first  and subsequent waves of this pandemic The Global COVID‐  Observatory and Resource Center for Childhood Cancer  A response for the pediatric oncology community by SIOP and St  Jude GlobalAfter rapidly spreading across the globe  COVID‐  officially became a pandemic on March    
 
 Initial reports suggested that patients with comorbidities were at higher risk  causing concern that children with cancer were at risk of developing severe infection 
 
 Furthermore  measures to mitigate the spread of the virus  such as delaying medical procedures and travel restrictions  were anticipated to disturb the continuity of pediatric cancer care 
 
 It was also anticipated that the effects of the pandemic on health systems would amplify existing obstacles to caring for children with cancer 
 

Since the beginning of the pandemic  a deluge of information regarding disease characteristics and possible management strategies was disseminated 
This infodemic  an overabundance of information during an epidemic 
 
 has posed challenges never encountered before and was an early concern 
 
 The rapid spread of information and misinformation  potentiated by social media platforms  presented a public health challenge  confusing and overwhelming healthcare professionals and lay public alike In response to the need for a trusted resource with curated  reliable information and a platform to share experiences for the pediatric oncology community  the International Society of Pediatric Oncology  SIOP  and St  Jude Children s Research Hospital  SJCRH  created the Global COVID‐  Observatory and Resource Center for Childhood Cancer  GCORCCC 
The GCORCCC was launched as an open‐access website  covid childhoodcancer org  on April    The Resource Library contains updated curated peer‐reviewed manuscripts  guidance documents  and links relevant to the multidisciplinary care of children with cancer during COVID‐ 
 
 Publications are reviewed and assessed for relevance weekly for inclusion 
 
 We prioritize the dissemination of accurate data and quickly identify and address misinformation or conflicting reports 
Only peer‐reviewed articles are included  as unvetted scientific information  such as preprints  were identified as a risk for misinformation for providers 
 
  
 

The sections of the Resource Library are as follows  COVID‐  and Pediatric Oncology  General COVID‐  Information  Treatment  Prevention  For Healthcare Providers  and For Patients and Families 
Each section provides a collection of publications  guidance documents  recorded webinars  and relevant links To address the needs of healthcare professionals during this unprecedented time  resources focusing on leadership  self‐care  and resiliency are also included in the Resource Library 
Additionally  a subsection specifically aimed at nurses  with literature and guidance documents  was developed 
The Pediatric Oncology Nursing during COVID‐  Fact Sheet summarizes the most relevant guidance for caring for children with cancer and is available in six languages as a quick bedside reference 
Finally  a section with resources for patients and families aids bedside providers in educating and navigating patients and families toward trusted  accurate sources of information At the beginning of the pandemic  the natural history of COVID‐  in children and adolescents with cancer was unknown 
To gain an accurate picture of the burden of COVID‐  among this patient population  we developed the Global COVID‐  Registry 
Healthcare providers worldwide were invited to voluntarily report any patient  under   years of age  with a malignancy or history of hematopoietic stem cell transplant at the time of a laboratory‐confirmed SARS‐CoV‐  infection 
The Registry was approved by the SJCRH Institutional Review Board As of December      cases from   countries have been reported 
Using aggregate data  we created an interactive data visualization dashboard to provide updates in a dynamic format  Figure  
The data visualization allows providers to filter cases by variables such as underlying diagnosis  cancer treatment  and COVID‐  outcomes Creating an opportunity to bring the global community of healthcare professionals together is an essential component of the GCORCCC 
The Collaboration Space provides a forum for healthcare professionals to interact and share their experiences and questions about caring for children with cancer during the COVID‐  pandemic 
The Collaboration Space has language translation capabilities  making it accessible to a large number of providers globally 
Here  users are also able to access content  such as videos  blog posts  and live events Through sharing experiences  providers can support and learn from each other 
From the Frontlines is a blog series published to highlight unique accounts of childhood cancer providers navigating COVID‐  around the world 
To date  the blog features stories from   providers in   countries 
These providers discuss the challenges their teams have faced and innovative solutions they have employed to continue to treat children with cancer during the pandemic 
Currently  there are   total active users registered in the Collaboration Space who have connected and interacted over   times with content elements A rapidly evolving pandemic poses many challenges in caring for children with cancer 
The GCORCCC established a mechanism to generate and transfer knowledge for the pediatric oncology community during a global pandemic and infodemic 
Through its various elements  users can access relevant information to help them adapt and respond to the rapidly shifting situation Academic institutions and professional societies should play central roles in the accurate and timely dissemination of information 
For professionals caring for children with cancer  the sharing of experiences from regions that were affected early in the pandemic was essential for formulating the initial responses to the evolving pandemic 
 
  
 
  
 
In addition  guidance for the management of COVID‐  for different patient populations was generated by government agencies and professional societies with remarkable speed 
 
  
 
  
 
Importantly  information sufficiency has been linked to less stress and worry amongst health care professionals 
 
 For this reason  a resource like the GCORCCC can support individuals to decrease burn out and improve resilience 
This effort brought colleagues together and facilitated a sense of community in these trying times  in an innovative approach to addressing global challenges in pediatric cancer care 
Many organizations attempted to compile listing of resources that are relevant to their specific populations  but few of them also sought to create knowledge about COVID‐  in their populations to add to the evidence‐based literature At a time of exceptionally high stakes for children with cancer  the multi‐stakeholder collaboration that led to the GCORCCC represents a framework for global cooperative efforts in the future 
SIOP and SJCRH formed a partnership aimed at disseminating the GCORCCC widely and rapidly throughout the global network  leveraging the strengths of both organizations 
This platform shows that novel  dynamic information resources can help provide guidance to frontline providers across the globe  facilitating the rapid sharing and adoption of new information in highly dynamic situations 
The collaborations built through this rapid multidisciplinary implementation and global dissemination process provide a foundation upon which the global community can collectively build to ultimately improve outcomes for all children with cancer everywhere In memoriam  This manuscript is dedicated to Dr  Arturo Moreno  past president of SLAOP SIOP Latin America  a tireless advocate for children with cancer in Mexico  Latin America  and the world The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest The Psychodynamic Approach During COVID  Emotional CrisisThe health emergency we are experiencing due to COVID  has strongly influenced not only physical health but also the mental health of the general population as well as collective behavior  Gray et al    Orrù et al   b  Lenzo et al   
The understanding of mental health consequences must consider individual emotional responses associated with the ongoing stressful experience of the COVID  pandemic  Di Giuseppe et al   a  Venuleo et al   
Negative emotions such as fear  anger  frustration and significant economic worries are associated with higher levels of anxiety  depression  sleep disturbances  maladaptive behaviors  and psychosomatic symptoms  Conversano et al   b  Franceschini et al    Parola et al   
As expected  the severity of clinical conditions is observed to be higher in vulnerable groups such as children  the elderly  psychiatric patients  and front line workers  Aafjes van Doorn et al   b  Elbay et al    Elkholy et al    Merlo et al    Shen et al    Singh et al    Orrù et al   
Research has demonstrated that emotion regulation plays a key role in stress management and adaptation helping the individual to cope with discharged feelings and thoughts related to the COVID  crisis  communication of the final stage of the individual s life  Iasevoli et al    and  therefore  protecting them from developing clinical levels of psychological distress  Di Giuseppe et al   e  Prout et al    Walker and McCabe   
The role of dynamic psychotherapy is essential in moderating people s emotional reactions  although its implementation requires the adjustment of therapeutic strategies enhancing adaptation and resilience  Aafjes van Doorn et al   a  Békés et al   
From this perspective  it is imperative to improve public awareness and establish adequate procedures and prompt responses of intervention Due to uncertainty surrounding COVID  collective distress and individual suffering  the psychodynamic approach may be able to consistently identify and manage stressful life event dynamics  Afari et al    Di Giuseppe et al   a  as well as fostering emotional regulation in order to prevent possible relevant factors involved in the pathogenesis of both psychological and psychosomatic syndromes  Lenzo et al    Martino et al   a b  Conversano and Di Giuseppe    Sardella et al   
This is of particular relevance at present with many experiencing grief and sorrow for the loss of a family member  a reduction of freedom  changes in daily routines and fears associated with uncertainty and the intolerance of uncertainty  Conversano et al   a  Orrù et al   a 
In response to these stressors  the individual activates unconscious defense mechanisms  psychological strategies that help in reducing the anxiety associated with the awareness of internal conflicts and externally charged situations  Perry    American Psychiatric Association   
Since defense mechanisms are hierarchically organized and own specific psychological functions  they may cause a wide number of negative consequences as well as playing a significant role as protective factors against psychological distress and psychopathological symptoms caused by the COVID  outbreak  Marazziti et al   
The use of high adaptive defense mechanisms promotes increased awareness of one owns feelings related to difficult life experiences and leads to better adjustment and resilience  whereas the use of immature defenses protects the self from painful feelings and thoughts at the cost of developing maladaptive affective  cognitive and relational disfunctions  Di Giuseppe et al    Perry et al   
Recent studies demonstrate that specific therapeutic intervention may increase the overall defensive maturity and improve psychological well being and adjustment  Hoffman et al    Prout et al   b    Di Giuseppe et al   d In this opinion article the relevance of the implementing psychodynamic approach in the prevention of individuals  mental health during the ongoing COVID  crisis has been highlighted 
In accordance with Marčinko et al 
  the inclusion of psychodynamic interventions within the public mental health emergency system is recommended  considered as an effective strategy in reinforcing the individual s well being both during and after the COVID  pandemic crisis 
The application of specific therapeutic interventions derived from the psychodynamic approach can enhance emotion regulation and adaptive responses as the COVID  pandemic progresses Understanding how the ongoing pandemic is influencing human reactions to such a stressful event is essential for developing ad hoc effective interventions 
The systematic assessment of unconscious psychological aspects of personality should be promoted for the early detection of vulnerable individuals and for improving research and clinical practice toward a personalized therapeutic approach  Lingiardi and McWilliams    Lingiardi et al    Tanzilli et al    Barber and Solomonov    Talia et al    Di Giuseppe et al   c  Zilcha Mano and Ramseyer   The author confirms being the sole contributor to this work and approves it for publication The author declares that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest Coping with COVID  An Examination of the Role of  Non Religiousness Non SpiritualityThe COVID  pandemic represents a global collective trauma event  Duane et al 
  and is among the first such events to disrupt and compromise the physical and emotional safety and lives of all United States  U S  Americans in the contemporary era 
Due to the novel nature of the current pandemic and diverse challenges  e g  social isolation  economic hardship  mental and physical health  grief  the utility of commonly employed coping strategies is unknown 
In general  adaptive coping strategies are associated with positive outcomes  whereas maladaptive coping strategies are associated with distress  Lazarus et al 
 
However  extant literature exploring coping strategies used in response to large scale disasters often emphasizes the utility of religious and spiritual coping  in particular  Aten et al 
  and excludes nonreligious and or nonspiritual people  Hwang et al 
 
Such studies may erroneously infer that nonreligious nonspiritual people are detrimentally impacted by the absence of religious spiritual  R S  coping despite their omission from participation 
In fact  little is known about the manner by which nonreligious and nonspiritual people cope with large scale events with the potential for individual and collective trauma  an omission the current study sought to address Collective traumas are events that disrupt daily life for an entire community and include natural and human caused disasters  Erickson   Silver et al 
  as well as sociopolitical oppressions  Comas Díaz et al 
  Kelly et al 
 
These shared traumatic events often deteriorate the sense of safety and security of those affected  Silver et al 
  and have negative psychological consequences  Goldmann et al 
  Luszczynska et al 
 
Though destruction and disruption often remain following such disasters  pandemics  including the COVID  pandemic  differ from other natural  e g  weather related  and human made  e g  mass shootings  disasters in the sustained nature of the event itself Symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder  PTSD  including depressive and anxious symptoms  are possible in response to collective trauma  Goldmann et al 
  but vary in prevalence  Bonanno   Neria et al 
 
Many factors other than the traumatic event likely influence the presentation of psychological symptoms  including disruption distress  social support and coping  Baral et al 
 
Survivors of the SARS pandemic in Hong Kong and Taiwan reported trauma related and other psychological symptoms including hopelessness  alienation and long term changes to mental and physical health 
Similar to COVID  in addition to illness and death  social and economic disruption accompanied SARS  Lei et al 
 
Though previous exposure to such collective trauma events likely increases resilience to future traumatic events  Bonanno et al 
  the U S  has not been significantly disrupted by a similar pandemic  e g  requiring physical distancing  face coverings  hand hygiene  widespread disruptions to schooling and employment  in over   years 
Therefore  US residents may experience more psychological consequences and possess fewer coping resources than people living in countries significantly impacted by recent  similar pandemics Coping refers to use of processes aimed at reducing  tolerating  or mastering stress 
In general  Lazarus et al 
  in response to natural and human made disasters  Cherry et al 
  Shing et al 
  and in the face of other global health crises like HIV AIDS  Blashill et al 
  emotion focused  e g  acceptance  positive reframing  and problem focused  e g  instrumental support  planning  coping  or adaptive coping strategies  are more effective than strategies categorized as dysfunctional or maladaptive  e g  denial  venting  substance use 
Further  the nature of the traumatic event may influence the effectiveness of coping strategies such that temporary losses may benefit from different techniques as compared to more permanent losses or changes  Shing et al 
 In a study of over   adults in Spain during a country wide COVID  lockdown    of participants reported anxious or depressive symptoms 
Lower levels of anxious and or depressive symptoms were associated with maintaining a healthy diet  avoiding news updates related to COVID  talking with friends and relatives  pursuing hobbies  spending time outdoors and following a routine  Fullana et al 
 
In April   in the U S  a national sample recruited online via MTurk reported most commonly using distraction  active coping and social support in response to COVID 
Of note  woman identified participants were more likely to use multiple emotion focused strategies  including religious support  whereas participants who were young  financially insecure  or identified as a sexual minority were more likely to engage in maladaptive strategies including disengagement and substance use  as well as humor  an adaptive coping strategy  Park et al 
 Though the potential benefits of religious and or spiritual identification and engagement for well being are well documented  Paloutzian et al 
  the absence of religious and or spiritual belief is not necessarily associated with low levels of well being  or poor adjustment following traumatic events 
Rather  the coherency hypothesis suggests the ability to make sense of the world  in whatever way fits for a person  is associated with well being 
Among nonreligious and nonspiritual people in Canada  engagement in religiousness  spirituality  and related practices  e g  meditation  church attendance  ranged from not associated to negatively associated with mental health  such that higher R S among nonreligious and nonspiritual participants was related to lower well being  Speed et al 
 
Therefore  it is more accurate to suggest religious and spiritual engagement  e g  prayer  church attendance  is generally beneficial for the health of those with religious and spiritual beliefs and values  Speed et al 
  but not a necessary condition of health for all people 
Galen et al 
  for example  found evidence of a curvilinear relationship between  non religiousness and well being  such that those with high levels of religiousness spirituality as well as those with high levels of nonreligiousness nonspirituality reported higher well being as compared to those with medium or low levels of  non religiousness non spirituality 
However  scant literature has explored the implications of this curvilinear relationship for mental health and well being in response to specific traumatic events  e g  natural disasters  pandemics The authors  Abbott et al 
  examined the mediating role of coping strategies in the relationship between trauma intensity and posttraumatic symptoms and growth  as moderated by  non religiousness non spirituality following a natural disaster in a small  rural city in the Southeastern U S 
Consistent with previous research  lower levels of depressive symptoms and higher posttraumatic growth were associated with higher institutional religiousness and individual spirituality 
However  upon probing an interaction between trauma and non religion non spirituality  nonreligious and nonspiritual participants reported lower depressive symptoms and more posttraumatic growth when employing adaptive coping strategies  specifically problem focused coping  e g  active coping  instrumental support and planning  Abbott et al 
 
This preliminary study suggests differences  if any  in mental health across the  non religious non spiritual spectrum may be associated with coping mechanisms utilized and  perhaps  the congruence of coping style with  non belief system The current study sought to examine the relationships between pandemic related trauma symptoms   non religiousness and  non spirituality  coping strategies and psychological distress among U S  Americans 
In particular  we were interested in exploring differences  if any  between the coping mechanisms applied by individuals ranging from atheist to very religious and subsequent mental health outcomes  in response to the COVID  pandemic 
Specifically  we hypothesized that   the relationship between pandemic related trauma and psychological distress would operate indirectly through coping style and   the relationships between trauma  psychological distress and coping will be moderated by institutional religiousness and individual spirituality such that differences are observed in those at high and low levels of R S  as compared to moderate levels of R S  in the use of coping in response to the pandemic and the relationship between coping style and psychological distress  see Fig 
 One hundred fifty three participants   female    male    unreported sex assigned at birth  volunteered through social media snowball sampling 
The ethnic racial composition of the sample was   White    Black    Hispanic Latinx    Asian Asian American Pacific Islander and   Arab Persian Middle Eastern 
The median educational attainment was Associate s Degree level and the median reported household income was between   and  
Participants came from   different states with the largest contingents residing in Washington state   Texas   and California  
Twenty nine percent of the sample identified as disabled  specifically    identified a sensory impairment    a mobility impairment    a learning disability and   a mental health disorder 
Importantly    of respondents identified with a Christian faith  while a combined   identified as either atheist   agnostic   or religiously unaffiliated  
Data were collected in the period of time during which the majority of US jurisdictions had enacted  Stay At Home  or similar types of orders and recruitment was discontinued when restrictions were relaxed by many state and local governing bodies 
A post hoc sensitivity analysis revealed sufficient power for detecting medium sized effects  f      at standard significance and power criteria  α     power    Institutional Review Board approval was provided by Central Michigan University  – 
Data collection began in late April   and completed in mid June   and the study materials were pre registered on an open science forum at  https osf io tsdr 
Participants were recruited primarily via social media  e g  Reddit  and snowball sampling 
All U S based adults   years of age or older  were invited to engage in questions related to their experience of the pandemic  e g  stress  economic impact  isolation  and   surveys  Brief COPE  B COPE  Carver   Depression  Anxiety  Stress Scales –    DASS  Lovibond et al 
  NonReligious NonSpiritual Scale  NRNSS  Cragun et al 
  and a demographics questionnaire including items related to social physical distancing behaviors Coping strategies utilized by participants were assessed using the  item B COPE  Carver  
The scale is comprised of   subscales that may be organized into three composite subscales 
The acceptance  emotional support  humor  positive reframing and religion subscales  Emotion Focused  and active coping  instrumental support and planning subscales  Problem Focused  are categorized as Adaptive  whereas the behavioral disengagement  denial  self distraction  self blame  substance use and venting subscales  Dysfunctional  are Maladaptive  Carver et al 
 
Initial reliabilities were good  Emotion Focused     Problem Focused     Dysfunctional     and construct validity was evidenced  Cooper et al 
 
In the present study  internal consistency for each broad type of coping were as follows  Problem Focused Coping  α     Emotion Focused Coping  α     and Dysfunctional Coping  α    
The B COPE is the most frequently used measure of coping across academic journals 
Additionally  though the alpha for Emotion Focused Coping in this study is low  it is within the typical range reported for subscales in other studies using the B COPE  the two other subscales  alphas are similar to the median in extant literature  Kato  We additionally asked an open ended question prompting participants to report any coping behaviors in which they would normally engage but could not during the pandemic 
About half of participants   reported that they were unable to engage in some of their preferred coping behaviors and in all cases  the identified behaviors were emotion focused 
This likely contributed to the low internal consistency for Emotion Focused Coping 
Further  an exploratory reliability analysis with the sample split into high and low  non religiousness revealed that the emotion focused coping items had acceptable reliability for participants above the mean in institutional religiousness  α    Psychological distress was measured by the Depression  Anxiety  Stress Scales –    DASS  Lovibond et al 
  consisting of three subscales  Depression  Anxiety and Stress 
Participants were asked to report the degree to which statements  including  I found it hard to wind down  and  I felt I had nothing to look forward to  applied to them over the past week on a  point Likert scale ranging from  Did not apply to me at all  to  Applied to me very much  most of the time  Higher scores indicate higher rates of depressive  anxious and stress symptoms 
Initial reliabilities during development of the scale were α     for the Depression items  α     for the Anxiety items and α     for the Stress items 
Reliability for the entire scale in the current study was high  α    
 Non religiosity and  non spirituality were assessed via the NRNSS  Cragun et al 
  a  item measure consisting of two subscales  institutional religiousness and individual spirituality 
The NRNSS measures religiousness spirituality on a spectrum ranging from nonreligious nonspiritual to very religious spiritual 
Participants reported their level of agreement with items including  I would describe myself as a religious person  and  Spirituality is important to me  using a  point Likert scale 
High scores suggest low institutional religiousness  nonreligiosity  and low individual spirituality  nonspirituality  and  inversely  low scores indicate high religiousness and spirituality 
Initial testing demonstrated strong internal consistency  α    
In the present study  the α was   for the nonreligion subscale and   for the nonspirituality subscale The intensity of pandemic related trauma was assessed using   item   Overall  how traumatic is the COVID  pandemic for you 
Participants responded using a  point Likert scale ranging from  Not at all traumatic  to  Intolerably traumatic  Higher scores indicated participants perceived they were experiencing higher levels of personal trauma due to COVID 
This measure is consistent with the variable used when testing a similar model in our own previously published research  Abbott et al 
 The combination of trauma  institutional  non religiousness and the Trauma x  Non religiousness interaction predicted significant variance in two of the three types of coping  problem focused coping  R      F        p     and dysfunctional coping  R      F        p    
Significant unique predictors included  non religiousness  which was negatively associated with reduced problem focused and emotion focused coping and pandemic related trauma  which was positively associated with more dysfunctional coping 
The overall model was not significant for emotion focused coping  R      F        p    
See Table   for summaries of unique effects of predictors on mediators The combination of trauma   non religiousness  problem focused coping  emotion focused coping  dysfunctional coping  Trauma x  Non religiousness  Problem focused Coping x  Non religiousness  Emotion focused Coping x  Non religiousness and Dysfunctional Coping x  Non religiousness predicted significant variance in psychological distress  R      F        p    
Significant unique predictors included trauma  problem focused coping and dysfunctional coping 
Increased trauma and dysfunctional coping were each associated with increased psychological distress  while increased problem focused coping predicted lower distress 
See Table   for a summary of the effects of unique predictors on the outcome variable While the interaction between trauma and  non religiousness was nonsignificant  indicating it cannot be concluded that individuals were affected by trauma differently based on their level of institutional  non religiousness  the conditional direct effect of trauma on psychological distress was significant at low and moderate levels of institutional  non religiousness but not significant at high levels of  non religiousness 
However  the conditional indirect effect of trauma on psychological distress through the mechanism of dysfunctional coping was significant at high nonreligiousness and moderate levels of  non religiousness  but not at low levels of  non religiousness Trauma and dysfunctional coping were both significant predictors of psychological distress and the trauma effect was significant via the mechanism of dysfunctional coping at moderate and high levels of  non religiousness 
This indicates  perhaps  that both religious and nonreligious individuals experienced psychological distress in the aftermath of trauma but that nonreligious individuals experienced psychological distress due to utilization of dysfunctional coping strategies 
The question of whether the direct and indirect effects are different for those across the spectrum of institutional  non religiousness remains unclear with current statistical power  however 
See Table   for summaries of unique effects of predictors on depressive symptoms The combination of trauma   non spirituality and the Trauma x  Non spirituality interaction predicted significant variance in two of the three types of coping  Problem focused coping  R      F        p     and dysfunctional coping  R      F        p    
The overall model was not significant for emotion focused coping  R      F        p    
Significant unique predictors included higher levels of  non spirituality associated with reduced problem focused coping and higher levels of pandemic related trauma associated with higher levels of dysfunctional coping 
See Table   for summaries of unique effects of predictors on mediators The combination of trauma   non spirituality  problem focused coping  emotion focused coping  dysfunctional coping  Trauma x  Non spirituality  Problem focused Coping x  Non spirituality  Emotion focused Coping x  Non spirituality and Dysfunctional Coping x  Non spirituality predicted significant variance in psychological distress  R      F        p    
Significant unique predictors included trauma  problem focused coping  dysfunctional coping and the  Non spirituality x Dysfunctional Coping interaction 
Increased trauma and dysfunctional coping were both associated with higher psychological distress  whereas increased problem focused coping predicting lower depressive symptoms 
See Table   for summaries of unique effects of predictors on the outcome variable Probing the  Non spirituality x Dysfunctional Coping interaction showed that the indirect effect of trauma on psychological distress through the mechanism of dysfunctional coping was significant at moderate and high levels of  non spirituality but not at low levels of  non spirituality 
This is consistent with the nonsignificant trend found in the  non religiousness model reported above and lends credence to the assumption that the interaction in that model should reach significance with more statistical power The relationship between pandemic related trauma and psychological distress in the current examination is congruent with previous collective trauma research  Baral et al 
  Goldmann et al 
  including a similar examination of coping and  non religiousness following a natural disaster  Abbott et al 
  and emerging data related to COVID   Schecter et al 
 
Therefore  it appears depressive  anxious and stress symptoms are possible in response to the COVID  pandemic among people in the US across the  non religious non spiritual spectrum Evidence regarding the relationships between religiousness and health is mixed 
Some research has suggested a curvilinear relationship between  non religiousness and health  Galen   but assumptions of compromised health among nonreligious people persist  in part due to an abundance of scholarship demonstrating a positive relationship between religiousness and psychological health  Paloutzian et al 
 
More recent research found comparable health outcomes and levels of happiness among theists and nontheists  Speed et al 
  and emphasized the importance of a coherent sense of the world and congruence between  non religiousness non spirituality and behaviors for health outcomes  Speed et al 
 
Our results may speak to some nuances in this relationship and the contexts in which it operates 
First  our results are consistent with prior findings indicating that those with moderate levels of religiousness exhibit lower well being than their highly religious or nonreligious counterparts  Galen et al 
  and that this may be related to dysfunctional coping 
Second  the unique context of the COVID  pandemic  associated stay at home orders and the resulting physical distancing recommendations may have exacerbated social isolation among nonbelievers and prevented them from engaging in effective emotion focused coping strategies as evidenced by the low reliability of the emotion focused coping items for nonreligious individuals and the open ended responses Internal consistency for the emotion focused coping subscale was adequate among more religious participants 
Indeed  religious spiritual participants could still engage in independent faith based coping strategies including prayer  meditation and comfort in their belief system and places of religious worship were among the first locations allowed to reopen in many areas of the country 
Although nonreligious people benefit similarly from social connection with like minded people  Galen   organized groups of nonbelievers can be difficult to find  inaccessible to nonbelievers with marginalized cultural positionalities  Abbott et al 
  or primarily online where the benefits of engagement on mental health may be less pronounced  Brewster et al 
  even under normal circumstances 
All of this is consistent with the notion that social support and belonging are the driving mechanisms behind the well documented relationship between religious commitment and well being Further  although previous research suggested nonreligious nonspiritual people were more likely to use problem focused coping in response to collective trauma in the form of a natural disaster  Abbott et al 
  perhaps due to their tendency to engage in analytical thinking to evaluate circumstances  Franks et al 
  Baker et al 
  most people are likely able to draw upon knowledge of other natural disasters by which they or others have been impacted in determining a personal response 
The novel nature of the COVID  pandemic may have made it difficult for nonreligious people to engage in otherwise preferred and problem focused methods of coping like planning  taking action to improve the situation and soliciting advice from others 
Substance use  a dysfunctional coping strategy  is associated with COVID related stress  particularly among women  Rodriguez et al 
  and represents a possible explanation for the relationship between higher trauma intensity and higher use of dysfunctional coping in the current investigation given a little over two thirds of participants were women The current study was limited by having insufficient statistical power for detecting small effects 
The limited time frame for collecting data  during the time period during which US jurisdictions enacted the most restrictive measures to contain the novel coronavirus and a lack of funding for quickly recruiting large numbers of participants resulted in a study powered enough to detect medium sized effects and larger 
As only   participants out of the already modest sample agreed to be contacted for follow up  we were unable to conduct a pre registered follow up data collection phase meant to measure posttraumatic growth 
Future research examining differences in coping strategies in response to traumatic events among individuals across the  non religious non spiritual spectrum should seek larger samples  employ longitudinal methods and explore other relevant variables  e g  posttraumatic growth  given this and previous research  e g  Abbott et al 
  have demonstrated important differences between individuals high and low on such measures Like all COVID  research conducted with a nationwide sample  this study was also subject to uncontrolled variance due to the US  lack of a coordinated national response to the pandemic 
Restrictions varied greatly state by state and sometimes county by county 
Some states also lagged far behind others in terms of the timing and severity of the pandemic s effects on public health and the economy 
Future research should  if possible  control for these factors perhaps using geographically nested analyses or by concentrating on a specific geographic region An error in survey design led to the omission of a measure for participant age 
Age effects would be hard to find in this study due to the relatively small sample size and the use of a sampling method  e g  Reddit  that would likely result in a very young sample 
A majority of young adults  however  are living with their parents rather than cohabitating with a friend  spouse  or significant other during the COVID  pandemic  Fry et al 
  which could  along with the increased propensity for the young to be non religious  Pew Research Center   make it more difficult for them to engage in emotion focused coping during a socially isolating event like a pandemic 
Future research should also examine age related differences in coping styles and outcomes during the coronavirus era The present examination suggests a complex relationship between self perceived COVID related trauma intensity  coping strategies  psychological distress and  non religiousness non spirituality  such that people across the  non religious non spiritual spectrum experience distress related to the COVID  pandemic 
However  the use and availability of typical adaptive and maladaptive coping mechanisms appears to vary by strength of  non religious non spiritual orientation in response to collective trauma 
Future  large scale studies are needed to continue exploring the relationship between exposure to collective traumatic events  psychological health and coping among people of diverse  non religious and  non spiritual identities in the interest of understanding what adaptive coping strategies are most useful  particularly for nontheists given their underrepresentation in extant trauma and coping literature Recombination Every Day  Abundant Recombination in a Virus during a Single Multi Cellular Host InfectionAs increasing numbers of full length viral sequences become available  recombinant or mosaic viruses are being recognized more frequently   
Recombination events have been demonstrated to be associated with viruses expanding their host range   or increasing their virulence    thus accompanying  or perhaps even being at the origin of  major changes during virus adaptation 
It remains unclear  however  whether recombination events represent a highly frequent and significant phenomenon in the everyday life of these viruses Viruses can exchange genetic material when at least two different viral genomes co infect the same host cell 
Progeny can then become hybrid through different mechanisms  such as reassortment of segments when the parental genomes are fragmented    intra molecular recombination when polymerases switch templates  in RNA viruses     or homologous or non homologous recombination  in both RNA and DNA viruses 
Quantification of viral recombination in multi cellular organisms has been attempted under two distinct experimental approaches  in vitro  in cell cultures     and in vivo  in live hosts    
The in vitro approach  which has so far been applied only to animal viruses  allows the establishment of the  intrinsic  recombination rate in experimentally co infected cells in cell cultures   
However  it does not necessarily reflect the situation in entire  living hosts  where the frequency of co infected cells is poorly known and depends on many factors such as the size of the pathogen population  the relative frequency and distribution of the different variants  and host defense mechanisms preventing secondary infection of cells 
The in vivo experimental approach is closer to biological conditions and may thus be more informative of what actually happens in  the real world However  as discussed below  numerous experimental constraints have so far precluded an actual quantification of the baseline rate of recombination 
First  many experimental designs have used extreme positive selection  where only recombinant genomes were viable  e g    
Other studies did not use complementation techniques but detected recombinants by PCR within infected hosts or tissues    which provides information on their presence but not on their frequency in the viral population 
So far  no quantitative PCR or other quantitative method has been applied to evaluate the number of recombinants appearing in an experimentally infected live host 
Finally  recent methods based on sequence analysis inferred the population recombination rate  rather than the individual recombination rate   
While results from these methods certainly take in vivo recombination into account  there are other caveats  isolates have often been collected in different hosts sometimes in different geographical regions and sometimes the selective neutrality of sequence variation on which these estimates are based is not clearly established 
Estimates from such studies by essence address the estimation of the recombination rate at a different evolutionary scale Taken together  the currently available information indicates that no viral recombination rate has ever been estimated directly at time and space scales corresponding to a single multi cellular host infection  although this level is most significant for the biology and evolution of viruses 
This study intends to fill this gap by evaluating the recombination frequency of the cauliflower mosaic virus  CaMV  during a single passage in one of its host plants  the turnip Brassica rapa CaMV is a pararetrovirus  which is a major grouping containing hepadnaviruses  e g  hepatitis B virus  badnaviruses  e g  banana streak virus  and caulimoviruses  e g  CaMV 
Pararetroviruses are characterized by a non segmented double stranded DNA genome 
After entering the host cell nucleus  the viral DNA accumulates as a minichromosome   whose transcription is ensured by the host RNA polymerase II   
The CaMV genome consists in approximately   bp and encodes six viral gene products that have been detected in planta  Figure     
Viral proteins P  to P  are expressed from two major transcripts  namely a  S RNA  encoding P  and a  S RNA corresponding to the entire genome and serving as mRNA for proteins P –P    
Using the pre genomic  S RNA as a matrix  the protein P   product of gene V  reverse transcribes the genome into genomic DNA that is concomitantly encapsidated   The detection of CaMV recombinants in turnip hosts has been reported numerous times 
Some studies have demonstrated the appearance of infectious recombinant viral genomes after inoculation  i  of a host plant with two infectious or non infectious parental clones   or  ii  of a transgenic plant containing one CaMV transgene with a CaMV genome missing the corresponding genomic region   
While the former revealed inter genomic viral recombination  the latter demonstrated that CaMV can also recombine with transgenes within the host s genome 
Another study based on phylogenetic analyses of various CaMV strains has clearly suggested different origins for different genomic regions and  hence  multiple recombination events during the evolution of this virus   
Indirect experimental evidence has indicated that  in some cases  CaMV recombination could occur within the host nucleus  between different viral minichromosomes  presumably through the action of the DNA repair cellular machinery   
Nevertheless  the mechanism of  template switching  during reverse transcription  predominant in all retroviruses  most certainly also applies to pararetroviruses 
For this reason  and on the basis of numerous experimental data  CaMV is generally believed to recombine mostly in the cytoplasm of the host cell  by  legal  template switching between two pre genomic RNA molecules    or  illegal  template switching between the  S and the  S RNA   
Under this hypothesis  recombination in CaMV could therefore be considered as operating on a linear template during reverse transcription  with the  ′ and  ′ extremities later ligated to circularize the genomic DNA  position   in Figure  
The above cited studies clearly demonstrate that CaMV is able to recombine 
However  since these studies are based on complementation techniques  non quantitative detection  or phylogenetically based inferences of recombination  they do not inform us on whether recombination is an exceptional event or an  everyday  process shaping the genetic composition of CaMV populations In the present work  we aimed at answering this question 
To this end  we have constructed a CaMV genome with four genetic markers  demonstrated to be neutral in competition experiments 
By co inoculating host plants with equal amounts of wild type and marker containing CaMV particles  we have generated mixed populations in which impressive proportions of recombinants distributed in several different classes corresponding to exchange of different genomic regions have been detected and quantified 
Altogether  the recombinant genomes averaged over   of the population 
Further analysis of these data  assuming a number of viral replications during the infection period ranging from five to   indicates that the per nucleotide per replication cycle recombination rate of CaMV is of the same order of magnitude  i e  on the order of a few   across the entire genome 
We thereby provide the first quantification  to our knowledge  of the recombination rate in a virus population during a single passage in a single host From Figure   and supposing that all marker containing genomic regions can recombine  we could predict the detection and quantification of seven classes of recombinant genotypes   bcd a  a cd b  ab d c  abc d   cd ab  a d bc  and a c b d 
Indeed  all classes were detected  and their frequencies in the ten CaMV populations analyzed are summarized in Table  Altogether  the proportion of recombinant genomes found in the mixed viral populations was astonishingly high and very similar in the ten co infected plants analyzed  Table   last column  ranging between    plant   to    plants     and   with a mean frequency   standard error  of      
This result indicates that recombination events are very frequent during the invasion of the host plant by CaMV and represents  to our knowledge  the first direct quantification of viral recombination during the infection of a live multi cellular host The inferred per generation recombination and interference rates  assuming that CaMV undergoes ten replication cycles during the   d between infection and sampling  are given for each of the ten plants in Table  
Recombination rates between adjacent markers are large  on the order of   to  
Taking the distance in nucleotides between markers into account yields an average recombination rate per nucleotide and generation on the order of      
Interestingly  this recombination rate does not vary throughout the genome  Kruskal–Wallis test  p    To relax the assumption of the number of replications during the   d  we calculated the recombination parameters assuming five or   generations 
The effect of the number of generations on the estimates is linear  doubling the number of generations results in a halving of the recombination rate  detailed results not shown 
For example  the average recombination rates r
  r
  and r
  assuming   generations were equal to     and   respectively  compare with values in Table   yielding per nucleotide per generation recombination rates of             and      Inspection of Table   also shows that first order interference coefficients were in general negative  indicating that a crossing over in one genomic segment increases the probability that a crossing over will occur in another genomic segment  while the second order coefficient parameter had an average value close to zero with a large variance 
The mechanism leading to these results will be discussed in the following section One major breakthrough in the work presented here lies in the space and time scales at which the experiments were performed 
Indeed  the processes occurring within the course of a single infection of one multi cellular host are of obvious biological relevance for any disease 
Previous studies on viral recombination suffered from major drawbacks in this respect  basing their conclusions on experiments relying on complementation among non infectious viruses or between viruses with undetermined relative fitness  on phylogenetically based analyses  or on experiments in cell cultures 
For reasons detailed in the Introduction  the first two methods either do not provide information on the frequency of recombination  but only its occurrence  or address the question at a different temporal  and often spatial  scale 
Results from cell cultures  on the other hand  impose cell co infection by different viral variants  potentially overestimating the frequency of recombination events 
Our study circumvents these limitations by analyzing viral genotypes sampled from infected plants after the course of a single infection  and therefore the invasion and co infection of cells in various organs and tissues is very close to natural More than half of the genomes       see Table   present in a CaMV population after a single passage in its host plant were identified as recombinants  and these data allowed us to infer a per nucleotide per generation recombination rate on the order of       to      
The time length of one generation  i e  the time required for a given genome to go from one replication to the next  is totally unknown in plant viruses 
The only experimental data available on CaMV are based on the kinetics of gene expression in infected protoplasts  where the capsid protein is produced between   and   h   
The reverse transcription and the encapsidation of genomic DNA being two coupled phenomena    we judged it reasonable to assume a generation time of   d and  thus  an average of ten generations during our experiments 
In case this estimate is mistaken  we have verified a linear relationship between r and the number of generations  thereby allowing an immediate adjustment of r if the CaMV generation time is more precisely established 
At this point  we must consider that all cloned genomes may not have been through all the successive replication events potentially allowed by the timing of our experiments 
It was previously shown that about   of CaMV mature virus particles accumulate in compact inclusion bodies    where they may be sequestered for a long time  as such inclusions are very frequent in all infected cells  including those in leaves that have been invaded by the virus population for several weeks 
The viral population may thus present an age structure that could bias the estimation of the recombination rate 
In order to minimize this bias  the clones we analyzed were collected in one young newly formed leaf  where the chances of finding genomes from  unsequestered lines  were assumed to be higher 
In any case  our data analysis is conservative  since this age structure can only lead to an underestimation of the recombination rate Our results show that interferences between pairs of loci are negative  a recombination event between two loci apparently increases the probability of recombination between another pair of loci 
We believe that the most parsimonious explanation of these negative interferences is based on the way the infection builds up within plant hosts 
Indeed  one can divide infected host cells into those infected by a single virus genotype and those infected by more than one viral genotype 
In the former  analogous to clonal propagation  recombination is undetectable 
In the latter  recombination is not only detectable but  as our results indicate  very frequent 
Samples consisting of viruses resulting from a mixture of these two types of host cell infections will thus contain viruses with no recombination and viruses with several recombination events  thus yielding an impression of negative interference 
These conceptual arguments are supported by mathematical models 
It is indeed easy to show  detailed results not shown  that if a proportion F of the population reproduces clonally  analogous to single infections  while the remaining reproduces panmictically  negative interferences could be inferred even if they do not exist 
For example  assuming a three locus model with real recombination rates r
  and r
  and interference i
  the  apparent  recombination and interference parameters  would be r
        F r  r
        F r
  and i
     F   i
    F 
Interestingly  this example also shows that our estimates of the recombination rate are conservative  that a fraction F of host cells are singly infected while others are multiply infected leads to an underestimation of the recombination rate As judged by r
  r
  and r
  calculated between markers a–b  b–c  and c–d  respectively  we found evidence for recombination through the entire CaMV genome 
The values for r
 
r
  and r
  are remarkably similar  hence the recombination sites seem to be evenly distributed along the genome 
We considered the template switching model as the major way recombinants are created in CaMV 
As already mentioned in the Introduction  hot spots of template switching have been predicted at the position of the  ′ extremities of the  S and  S RNAs   
If other recombination mechanisms  such as that associated with second strand DNA synthesis or with the host cell DNA repair machinery  act significantly  hot spots would be expected at the positions of the sequence interruption     and     
Due to the design of our experiment and the position of the four markers  we have no information on putative hot spots at positions corresponding to the  ′ end of the  S RNA and to    at nucleotide position  
Nevertheless  the putative hot spots at the  ′ end of the  S RNA and at   and    nucleotide positions   and   respectively  fall between marker pairs c–d  b–c  and a–b  respectively 
Our results indicate that either these hot spots are quantitatively equivalent though predicted by different recombination mechanisms or  more likely  that they simply do not exist 
Whatever the explanation  what we observe is that the CaMV can exchange any portion of its genome  and thus any gene thereof  with an astonishingly high frequency during the course of a single host infection To our knowledge  the viral recombination rate has never previously been quantified experimentally for a plant virus   
In contrast  retroviruses and particularly HIV  have been extensively investigated in that sense 
As we have already discussed for these latter cases  the quantification of the intrinsic recombination rate was carried out in artificially co infected cell cultures 
The estimated intrinsic per nucleotide per generation recombination rate in HIV  is on the order of      less than one order of magnitude higher than our estimation for CaMV 
Because for various reasons detailed above we probably underestimate the within host CaMV recombination rate  we believe that the intrinsic recombination rate in CaMV is higher and perhaps on the order of that of HIV Other pararetroviruses such as plant badnaviruses or vertebrate hepadnaviruses have a similar cycle within their host cells  including steps of nuclear minichromosome  genomic size RNA synthesis  and reverse transcription and encapsidation 
Nevertheless  vertebrate hepadnaviruses  e g  hepatitis B virus  infect hosts that are very different from plants in their biology and physiology  and this could lead to a totally different frequency of cell co infection during the development of the virus populations 
Thus  even though our results can be informative for other pararetroviruses because of the viruses  shared biological characteristics  they should not be extrapolated to vertebrate pararetroviruses without caution We used the plasmid pCa  which is the complete genome of the CaMV isolate Cabb S  cloned into the pBR  plasmid at the unique SalI restriction site   
To analyze recombination in different regions of the genome  we introduced four genetic markers  a  b  c  and d  at the positions       and   respectively  thus approximately at four cardinal points of the CaMV circular double stranded DNA of   bp  Figure  
All markers  each corresponding to a single nucleotide change  were introduced by PCR directed mutagenesis in pCa  and resulted in the duplication of previously unique restriction sites BsiWI  PstI  MluI  and SacI in a plasmid designated pMark S  Because  in this study  we targeted the possible exchange of genes between viral genomes  all markers a  b  c  and d were introduced within coding regions corresponding to open reading frames I  IV  V  and VI  respectively 
Another important concern was to quantify recombination in the absence of selection  i e  to create neutral markers 
Consequently all markers consist of synonymous mutations  see below To generate the parental virus particles  plasmids pCa  and pMark S were mechanically inoculated into individual plants as previously described   
All plants were turnips  B  rapa cv   Just Right  grown under glasshouse conditions at   °C with a    light dark  photoperiod 
Thirty days post inoculation  all symptomatic leaves were harvested and viral particles were purified as described earlier   The resulting preparations of parental viruses  designated Cabb S and Mark S  were quantified by spectrometry using the formula described by Hull et al 
  
We fixed the initial frequency of markers to a value of   and a solution containing   mg ml of virus particles of both Cabb S and Mark S at a   ratio was prepared 
Plantlets were co infected by mechanical inoculation of two to three leaves with   μl of this virus solution  using abrasive Celite AFA  Fluka  Ronkonkoma  New York  United States 
The mixed CaMV population was allowed to grow during   d of systemic infection We designed an experimental protocol for quantifying marker frequency within a mixed Cabb S Mark S virus population after a single passage in a host plant 
Twenty four individual plants  inoculated as above with equal amounts of Cabb S and Mark S  were harvested   d post inoculation  when symptoms were fully developed 
The viral DNA was purified from   mg of young newly formed infected leaves according to the protocol described previously   
After the precipitation step of this protocol  the viral DNA was resuspended and further purified with the Wizard DNA clean up kit  Promega  Fitchburg  Wisconsin  United States  in TE  X   mM Tris HCl and   mM EDTA  pH   
Aliquots of viral DNA preparations were digested by restriction enzymes corresponding either to marker a  b  c  or d and submitted to a   agarose gel electrophoresis  colored by ethydium bromide and exposed to UV 
Each individual restriction enzyme cut once in Cabb S DNA and twice in Mark S  thus generating DNA fragments of different sizes attributable to one or the other in the mixed population of CaMV genomes 
After scanning the agarose gels  we estimated the relative frequency of the two genotypes in each viral DNA preparation and at each marker position  by densitometry using the NIH   Image program 
The statistical analyses of the frequency of the four markers are described below To identify and quantify the recombinants within the CaMV mixed populations  aliquots from ten of the   viral DNA preparations described above were digested by the restriction enzyme SalI  and directly cloned into pUC  at the corresponding site 
In each of the ten viral populations analyzed    full genome length clones were digested separately by BsiWI  PstI  MluI  and SacI  to test for the presence of marker a  b  c  and d  respectively 
In this experiment  with the marker representing an additional restriction site  we could easily distinguish between the Cabb S and the Mark S genotype at all four marker positions  upon agarose gel   electrophoresis of the digested clones 
Clones with none or all four markers were parental genotypes  whereas clones harboring     or   markers were clearly recombinants 
Due to the very high number of recombinants detected  markers eventually appearing or disappearing due to spontaneous mutations were neglected Here we present the different methods we used to quantify recombination in the CaMV genome 
Because all these methods assume that the different markers are neutral  we first discuss assumption We used two datasets to test the neutrality of markers  both resulting from plants co infected with a   ratio of Mark S and Cabb S 
The first consisted of viral DNA densitometry data derived from   plants  described above  where for each plant we have an estimate of the frequency of each marker in the genome population 
The second consisted of the restriction of   individual full genome length viral clones obtained from one co infected plant  described above  yielding an estimate of the frequency of each marker  and this was repeated on ten different plants 
The frequencies of the different markers were       and   for markers a  b  c  and d in the first dataset and       and   in the second dataset 
We tested whether these frequencies were significantly different from the expected value under neutrality    using either t tests  for datasets where normality could not be rejected  seven out of eight cases  or Wilcoxon signed rank non parametric tests otherwise  marker c in the first dataset 
In all cases p values were larger than  There are several cautionary remarks regarding these analyses 
First  in all cases we found an excess of markers 
Unfortunately  the two datasets cannot be regarded as independent because  even though the methods through which the frequency estimates were obtained were different  the plants used in the second dataset were a subset of the plants of the first 
We thus have only four independent estimates in each case  and there is minimal power to detect significant deviations from neutrality with such a small sample size 
It should be noted at this stage that deviations from the expected value could also be caused either by slight deviations from the   ratio in the infecting mixed solution  or by deviations from that ratio in the frequency of the viral particles that actually get into the plants 
Second  because of the relatively small sample sizes and low statistical power  the tests presented above could have detected only large deviations The results clearly show  however  precisely that the markers do not have large effects  if any  and that therefore recombination estimates would be affected only very slightly by any hypothetical selective effects of the markers 
Because of this  along with the fact that the introduced markers provoke silent substitutions in the CaMV genome  we assumed that markers were effectively neutral in the rest of the analysis The dataset used to estimate the recombination frequency consisted of the   full genome length viral clones   from each of ten co infected plants  individually genotyped for each of the four markers 
As discussed in detail in the Results  recombination was very frequent and concerned all four markers 
Indeed  approximately half of the genotyped clones exhibited a recombinant genotype 
It was therefore meaningful to try to obtain quantitative estimates of recombination from our data Our aim was to analyze viral recombination in a live host 
Consequently  we had to deal with the fact that more than one viral replication cycle occurred during the   d that infection lasted in our experiment  we had to wait that long for the disease to develop and to be able to recover sufficient amounts of viral DNA from each infection 
Based on the kinetics of gene expression    we postulate that each replication cycle lasts between   and   d  and that therefore seven to ten cycles occurred between infection and the sampling time 
In case this assumption is incorrect  we did calculations assuming five  seven  ten  or   replication cycles during these   d  As shown  the results were not affected qualitatively  and only slightly quantitatively 
It is important to note that we assumed that recombination occurred through a template switching mechanism  and that therefore  from a recombination point of view  the CaMV genome is linear 
The reverse transcription starts and finishes at the position   in Figure   which is the point of circularization of the DNA genome 
This implies that changes between contiguous markers a–b  b–c  and c–d can be considered as true recombination whereas those between a and d cannot  as they may simply stem from circularization of DNA  during the synthesis of which the polymerase has switched template once anywhere between a–b  b–c  or c–d To estimate the recombination rate between markers  we wrote recurrence equations describing the change in frequency of each genotype over one generation  assuming random mating and no selection  i e  the standard Wright–Fisher population genetics model 
We then expressed the frequency of all possible genotypes n generations later as a function of their initial frequency and of the recombination parameters 
Subsequently we calculated the maximum likelihood estimates of the recombination parameters and their asymptotic variances given initial frequencies  we assumed that the two  parental  genotypes  Mark S and Cabb S  had equal initial frequencies of   and that all other genotypes had initial frequencies of zero  and frequencies after n generations  the observed frequencies  as stated above we used different values of n 
All algebraic and numerical calculations were carried out with the software Mathematica The recombination parameters are the recombination rates between two adjacent loci  e g  r
  for the recombination rate between markers a and b  and the interference coefficients  e g  i
  for interference between recombination events in the segments between markers a and b and b and c  To define these parameters we followed Christiansen    and in particular the recombination distributions for two  three  and four loci  respectively  Tables     and   of   
It is important to realize that given the definitions of these parameters  the estimator of the recombination rate between two loci is not affected by the number of loci considered 
In other words  we obtain the same estimation of the recombination rate between markers a and b whether we consider genotypic frequencies at just these two loci  or the frequencies at these two loci plus a third locus  or the complete information to which we have access  the four marker genotypes 
Information on additional loci only affects the estimates of the interference coefficients It proved impossible to carry out the calculations for four loci algebraically 
Instead  we used a computer program to calculate the expected genotypic frequencies at all four loci after n generations  given the above stated initial frequencies and specified recombination parameters 
For each combination of recombination parameters we calculated a Euclidean distance between the vector of the expected genotypic frequencies and the observed genotypic frequencies  and considered that the estimated recombination parameters were those yielding the minimal Euclidean distance 
In all cases  the estimated recombination rates between pairs of loci were equal to the second decimal to those estimated algebraically from data for three or two loci Tumor Restrictions to Oncolytic VirusIn most solid tumors the tumor interior displays a high cellular density with multiple cell types  both malignant and normal  stromal  cells  interdigitated by strands of extracellular matrix  ECM  and other poorly defined tissue 
Stromal cells typically consist of fibroblasts  macrophages  neutrophils and other immune cell types 
Tumor associated fibroblasts are a source of the bulk acellular tissue in tumors    which is largely made up of polysugars and glycoproteins  such as collagens  laminins  fibronectins  proteoglycans  hyaluronan and water  forming a dense matrix around and between the cancer cells   
This matrix provides structural support but also haptotactic and chemotactic guidance for cancer cells   
Moreover  the prevailing tumor interstitium is rich in soluble angiogenic factors  such as members of the vascular endothelial growth factor  VEGF  family    cellular growth factors  including endothelial growth factor  EGF  basic fibroblast growth factor  FGF  platelet derived growth factor  PDGF  and pleiotrophic factors  particularly transforming growth factor  TGF  beta   
Additionally  both tumor  and stromal cells secrete cytokines and chemokines  such as interleukin  IL    IL   tumor necrosis factor  TNF  alpha  stromal cell derived factor  SDF    macrophage migration inhibitory factor  MIF    which on one hand recruit more stromal and progenitor cells into the tumors and on the other hand curb the activity of antigen presenting cells and anti tumor T cells   
In several independent cancer types  high serum levels of IL   and IL   are indicators of poor prognosis   Aberrant tumor and stromal growth combined with an overproduction of matrix leads to high interstitial pressure in the tumor  preventing lateral diffusion of therapeutic compounds within the tumor 
Tight cellular compactness combined with a high tumor proliferation rate also causes physical crowding and puts constraints on oxygenation  which due to aberrant angiogenesis and rupture of the haphazard vessels is mostly incomplete and results in chronic tissue hypoxia toward the tumor cores 
As cancer cells exist in a crowding hypoxic  and cytokine growth factor perpetuated chronic state of stress  they upregulate a number of key cellular molecules that function as a collective defense against a wide range of therapies  including oncolytic viruses 
The properties of oncolytic viruses and their status in clinical development as well as various delivery options have been reviewed elsewhere   
In this review  we provide an overview of two of the main intratumoral barriers to oncolytic virus spread  the extracellular tumor make up and the intracellular antiviral defense mechanisms Tumor cellular structure and composition may in concert with abundant extracellular matrix  ECM  deposition pose a severe hurdle for systemic virus entry and propagation of infection within the tumor 
The extracellular matrix is a complex dense network consisting of multiple proteins  glycoproteins and polysaccharides including collagens  laminins  fibronectins  proteoglycans and hyaluronic acid   
The interstitial fluid pressure  IFP  in the tumor surrounding blood and lymphatic vessels is mainly created by the high cell density that forms an increased physical pressure outwards and does not allow free diffusion of therapeutics   
A high IFP generally predicts an aggressive tumor phenotype as tumor cells tend to escape from tumor margins where the pressure drops  thus facilitating spread of metastatic cells   
On the other hand  for therapeutic virus  interstitial fluid concentration gradients may pose a hurdle as passive diffusion in viable regions  typically the rim  may occur mainly outward   
Given the limited arsenal of known chemicals alleviating tumor compactness and the poor penetration drugs in general into the tumor tissue  this is a considerable problem that may not be easy to tackle 
Some strategies are discussed below Viruses are passive particles and rely either on radial cell to cell spread or on soluble diffusion across concentration gradients to reach their target cells and to propagate the infection 
Tumor matrix is critical in this regard  as it can block both forms of spread 
Passively diffusing viruses may physically not fit through the strands of the ECM 
This was shown for oncolytic herpes virus  which has an outer diameter of over   nm  and whose spreading could be improved by matrix degrading bacterial collagenase co injection   
Bilbao and coworkers showed that adenovirus entry into experimental hepatocellular carcinoma nodules in the livers of immunocompetent rats following intravenous or intraportal injection was directly related to the thickness of the ECM capsule enveloping the nodules   
On the other hand  we found using Semliki Forest virus  which has an outer diameter of about   nm  that even upon intratumoral injection spread was blocked by ECM  which formed a physical barrier for virus infection  Figure  The foremost option to reduce interstitial fluid pressure and to remove physical molecule barriers imposed by the ECM is to use matrix degrading enzymes 
These act by digesting collagen  fibrin  and other types of fibrillar matrix deposits  creating more space between cell clusters  and glycosaminoglycan polymers  known to limit fluid movement in tumors 
Simultaneously  such strategies may also expose more cell surface to viruses  increasing the likelihood of infection 
In a study by Kuriyama  trypsin or collagenase dispase was injected into subcutaneous U  and U  glioma xenografts in immunocompromised mice  followed by a reporter adenovirus   
Both types of ECM degrading enzymes increased tumor transduction by the virus  but when doses got too high  transduction efficacy suffered  demonstrating a balance between ECM degradation and oncolytic virus efficacy 
In another study  treatment of PC  tumors with vaccinia virus producing matrix metalloprotease  MMP    resulted in reduction of collagen IV fibrils and increase in virus penetration into tumor  which yielded elevated virus titers   
Hong et al 
targeted orthotopic neuroblastoma xenografts engineered to express MMP  with oncolytic HSV  achieving increased virus distribution compared to control tumors   
Similar results were obtained when human soft tissue sarcoma HSTS T overexpressing MMP  or MMP  were injected with oncolytic HSV   
MMP expressing tumors contained significantly less sulfated glycosaminoglycans compared to control tumors 
Other enzymes and protein effectors  either engineered into virus expression cassettes or provided exogenously  include hyaluronidase  decorin  various other MMPs  and notably relaxin a peptide hormone normally expressed during particular phase of pregnancy that does not possess tissue degrading activity itself  but instead induces a number of key collagen degrading proteases seemingly in a tumor specific manner   
Beyer showed that relaxin expressed by murine stem cells improved trastuzumab penetrance and therapy outcome in syngeneic tumor models   
In another study  chimeric adenovirus Ad  expressing relaxin showed increased tumor transduction and virus dissemination   Several other strategies to increase penetration of therapeutics in tumors have been developed   
While the stromal ECM capsule of tumor nodules acts as a physical barrier to virus entry following intravenous injection  it was possible to improve tumor infection by administering vaso active compounds  angiotensin II  histamine  nitroglycerine  before the virus   
This is interesting  as vasculature per se would not be expected to alter or influence the physical composition of the ECM  such as collagen strand thickness 
Instead  virus access to the tumor was improved  most likely by increased access from the blood via tumor stromal adjoining vessels 
Interestingly  in a study with oncolytic herpes virus  anti VEGF monoclonal antibody Bevacizumab given before intravenous virus injection gave poorer anti tumor efficacy than when given after the virus   
The study showed that while HSV is able to enter and infect tumors better through their leaky vasculature compared to Bevacizumab normalized vasculature  vascular normalization by Bevacizumab still gave superior combination efficacy when the virus was already in the tumor 
This effect was likely dependent on altering both physical and biological properties of the tumor  including interstitial pressure and oxygenation 
In another study  anti VEGF A antibody injections in nude mice harboring U  human glioma xenografts led to an increase in MMP  expression and reduction in collagen fiber content  facilitating improved distribution of oncolytic adenovirus within the tumor tissue   
In general  targeting tumor vasculature by oncolytic viruses and including agents that affect tumor vasculature in combination regimens is gaining interest    and it will be interesting to see more specific studies on how vascular acting agents may affect the physical barriers to oncolytic viruses Some viruses do not need an extracellular step for propagating infection  such as members of the herpes and poxvirus families  and may be able to spread from cell to cell 
For example  HSV  is able to infect neighboring cells via lateral tight junctions in a manner dependent on its glycoproteins E and I   
Vaccinia virus  on the other hand  induces so called actin tails  which are actin filament driven membranous protrusions of the plasma membrane harboring a single virus particle at the outer tip 
These actin tails actively deliver and deposit virus particles onto or even into neighboring cells   
Because lateral spread without an extracellular step may circumvent neutralizing immunity as well as some of the physical obstacles the tumor microenvironment imposes  this ability has been engineered into viruses that normally do not possess it 
A promising strategy is to engineer OVs to express membrane fusogenic genes  MFGs  such as gibbon ape leukemia virus  GALV  glycoprotein  reptilian reovirus p  protein  FAST  or the membrane glycoproteins H and F of measles virus   
Quite intriguingly  expression of several different MFGs by oncolytic adenovirus synergized with chemotherapy in anti tumor efficacy both in vitro and in vivo    suggesting that membrane fusion facilitated lateral spread of also chemotherapeutics  which otherwise would not have occurred in a compact tumor 
The potential limitation of cell to cell dependent spread  however  may be that membrane free physical barriers  such as the ECM  may still pose a barrier to spread 
Also  it is unclear whether MFGs or other mechanisms of lateral spread may assist in reaching distant tumor nests Some other strategies to alleviate matrix imposed restrictions to oncolytic viruses have been discussed elsewhere   Tumors of epithelial origin mostly retain the firm cellular integrity seen in their original adhesive intercellular configuration 
Several viruses use cellular receptors which are located in paracellular tight junctions  which may be problematic in tightly packed tumors   
Adenovirus C group viruses use coxsackie adenovirus receptor  CAR  as their primary entry point  whereas adenovirus B  group members and measles virus Edmonston use CD  complement binding molecule as their cellular receptor   
Adenovirus B  group  serotypes       and   entry occurs using desmoglein   DSG    
Of these  CAR and DSG  are preferentially located within tight junctions and are hidden from virus binding   
Also the complement receptor CD  was ascribed a role in maintenance of epithelial cell integrity by interactions with the E cadherin catenin network   
These observations imply that before reaching the potential entry site on the tumor cell the virus must find its way into the junctional space 
Moreover  it has become increasingly clear that for example glioma tumors traditionally targeted by Ad  serotype adenoviruses often express only low levels of CAR and instead much higher levels of CD    Beyond that tight junctions hide multiple virus receptors  they contain a network of adhesion molecules  including ZO  cadherins  claudins and occludin  which  if perturbed  is associated with more aggressive disease in many types of cancer   
Since tight junctions also contain important receptors that mediate tumor promoting signaling and which have been targeted by monoclonal antibodies  notably Her  it would be highly useful to develop strategies that temporarily loosen the tight junction contacts even at cost of a transient increase in tumor metastatic risk 
One of the most interesting approaches has been to exploit the natural propensity of adenovirus serotype   which as part of its natural life cycle creates dodecahedral particles  PtDd  consisting of viral capsid proteins  penton base and fiber that open tight junctions by binding to and dissolving desmoglein  dimers and reducing E cadherin expression  to develop a specific tight junction opening molecule  JO    
Adenovirus type   uses PtDds to promote its own infection  opening the tight junctions ahead of infection to maximize access to desmoglein 
Analogously  when administered to human tumor xenografts  JO  facilitated penetration of trastuzumab much deeper into the tumor tissue than when the monoclonal antibody was administered on its own   
Moreover  JO  synergized with several chemotherapeutics in solid tumor models   
Backed by our own findings with oncolytic SFV  showing that both extracellular matrix and tumor cell compactness restrict virus spread and oncolytic efficacy  we believe combination approaches that target both tight junctions and extracellular matrix will prove effective in future virotherapy development  Figure  An alternative approach to increasing tumor penetration by oncolytic viruses is to alter tumor cell morphology and status 
Notably  cell death and in particular the type of cell death induced by virus has been shown to affect virus distribution within a tumor mass  in a study by Nagano et al  administration of apoptosis inducing paclitaxel before injecting oncolytic herpes simplex virus increased virus dissemination in the tumor  allowing its diffuse in  tunnels  created by shrinking dying tumor cells   Maintenance of physiological adherence is essential for proper ECM function and for retaining cellular integrity 
Therefore  a potential caveat of using ECM degrading proteolytic enzymes or tight junction openers is the risk of neoplastic cell detachment from the tumor ECM and increased risk of metastasis 
While ECM degradation or tight junction opening may operate innocuously  there is also a chance that loss of E cadherins via proteases or via non specific deregulation of tight junction integrity during ECM modulating therapy could trigger pro tumorigenic Wnt β catenin signaling  possibly driving epithelial to mesenchymal transition   
One study showed that ectopic relaxin expression stimulated MMP expression and enhanced breast cancer invasiveness    whereas another paper found short term relaxin exposure to increase breast cancer cell motility whereas long term expression reduced both motility and cancer invasiveness   
In the context of oncolytic viruses  Lavilla Alonso tested several proteases  including hyaluronidase  relaxin  and macrophage metalloelastase  and showed they all could assist adenovirus entry into tumors  yet  the authors did not detect treatment induced metastases or increase in tumor invasiveness   
Another strategy possibly balancing some of the putative risks of tight junction disruption could be to use Wnt dependent oncolytic viruses   Tumors are invariably fenestrated by host fibroblasts  myeloid cells and other non transformed cells  which driven by cancer induced cues can adopt various reprogrammed phenotypes to promote tumor angiogenesis and growth and to alter tumor responses to therapies   
As most of them normally play a role in immune homeostasis and pathogen sensing  they also respond to and influence oncolytic virus infection of tumors Fulci et al 
reported that injection of oncolytic HSV  directly into glioblastoma tumor parenchyma triggered upregulation of CD  and CD  monocytic markers and rapid clearance of virus  likely executed by infiltrating phagocytic cells   
When clodronate liposomes were used to deplete macrophages in vivo  the authors observed a  fold increase in virus titers in the brain tumors concomitant with an   reduction in peripheral CD  macrophages in animal spleens  suggesting that CD  cells migrate into the tumors upon virus injection and limit overall oncolytic efficacy 
While CD  cells were not reduced by peripheral macrophage depletion  arguing that these cells had been recruited to the tumors before the treatment  they could be eliminated in live glioma slices ex vivo  resulting in a  fold increase in virus replication 
Macrophages may secrete antiviral type I interferon constitutively at very low  subnanomolar  levels   and recently Liu et al 
showed that tumor resident CD  macrophages induced a protective antiviral state in ovarian and breast tumors which led to resistance to oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus  VSV  infection   
Type I IFN signaling  JAK  inhibitor Ruxolitinib reversed the resistance  facilitating VSV replication in the macrophage protected cancer cells 
It is tempting to speculate that tumor resident macrophages also rendered syngeneic GL  and DBT mouse gliomas completely refractory to VA  oncolytic alphavirus  as these cells were quite infectable in vitro and live glioma slices regained their sensitivity to virus within   h  indicating dilution of IFN I   Macrophages or the closely related myeloid suppressor cells are the predominant stromal cell type in many tumors and are actively recruited during cancer progression   
Heavy macrophage presence in the tumors indicates that such tumors may be resistant to oncolytic virotherapy  unless depleting preconditioning would be used 
Moreover  as part of the early immune response to virus infection  monocytic cells are rapidly recruited to tumors following intratumoral virus injection 
In one study  depletion of either CD b  cells or VEGF secreted by these cells in mice treated with oncolytic HSV  greatly increased oncolytic efficacy  tentatively linking pro tumorigenic and antiviral angiogenic mechanisms   Another key pro tumorigenic signaling employed by many tumors is up regulation of CXCR  the receptor for chemokine CXCL   also known as SDF  and recruitment of stromal cells expressing CXCL  which maintain the tumor and recruit additional cells to support tumor expansion and invasion  such as endothelial cell progenitors which contribute to neovascularization   
Indeed  high CXCR  expression is a negative prognostic factor for many cancers 
Oncolytic vaccinia virus engineered to express a soluble antagonist of CXCR  showed improved intratumoral virus replication  increased vascular disruption and a markedly reduced infiltration of the tumors by putative immune suppressive and tumor promoting stromal cells   
This study highlights how reducing pro tumor stromal cell effects may alleviate antiviral resistance and yield increased overall therapeutic efficacy 
On the other hand  if the paracrine antiviral effects of tumor homing monocytic cells could be selectively abrogated these cells could favorably be used to ferry oncolytic viruses into tumors 
Indeed  a significant delay in metastatic tumor potential was achieved when macrophages were harnessed to deliver a tumor specific oncolytic adenovirus   What is the antiviral status in human cancer 
Recent analyses from different normal cells that occupy the same organ reveal striking functional variation in components of the type I IFN signaling pathway that correlate with the tissue tropism and virulence of some virus strains   
Can similar variation in such components be found in cancer cells  or do cancer cells make an exception Transformed cells undergo selective elimination by the immune system before becoming cancerous  termed immunoediting  based on observations of differential capacity of immunocompetent mice to reject tumors previously grown in immunocompromised hosts versus syngeneic animals   
Cancer cell responsiveness to type I and type II IFNs plays a role during immunoediting  cancer cells that eventually progress to form a tumor display reduced capacity to respond to IFN gamma  which otherwise would upregulate MHC class I molecules and render the tumors amenable to CD  T cell mediated destruction  whereas responsiveness to type I interferon initially helps tumors avoid immune purging during the editing phase and is then irrelevant   
Of note  the anti tumor effects of type I IFN  still exploited today in several cancers  were shown to depend on host NK cells  and mice in which IFNAR was blocked by monoclonal antibody failed to reject even highly immunogenic tumors  as opposed to mice treated with control antibody  who all rejected the immunogenic tumor challenge   
Thus  whereas tumor responsiveness to type I IFN is not predetermined after immunoediting  other factors post immunoediting may influence it In several tumor types  varying levels of expression of components of the type I IFN signaling cascade have been detected  and in some tumor types these components have been found to have prognostic value  whereas in others they do not seem to influence survival   
However  emerging data suggests that antiviral genes may predict poor survival because they increase treatment resistance 
In one study  poor prognosis of several types of cancer due to genotoxic treatment resistance was found to correlate with increased activity of IFN I pathway genes   
In this study  a triad of type I IFN signaling pathway genes  STAT  ISG  and IFIT  formed a pan tumor type negative prognostic factor  and a broader seven gene cluster established negative prognostic criteria for treatment resistant breast cancer 
Treatment resistance was subsequently shown to depend on STAT  signaling  STAT expressing tumor clones were positively selected in animals in vivo  demonstrating increased proliferation and metastatic potential  and STAT expression mediated resistance against genotoxic assault by doxorubicin or ionizing radiation  knockdown of STAT  resulted in lower proliferation rate and metastatic capacity and increased sensitivity to genotoxic stress    
In another study  resistance to epigenetic DNA modifiers  AZA dC  a methyltransferase inhibitor  and LBH  or MGCD  both histone deacetylase  HDAC  inhibitors  was correlated with increased expression of IFN I pathway genes in small lung cancer cells   
Basal IFN related gene expression in several different SML cell lines was upregulated Interestingly  in many cancers  STAT proteins are not phosphorylated and persist in unphosphorylated form  U STAT 
Like its phosphorylated counterpart  U STAT  increases expression of genes contributing to resistance to DNA damaging agents   
While it is currently unknown why cancers may prefer to use unphosphorylated forms  it is known that U STATs activate distinct signals compared to their phosphorylated counterparts 
However  importantly for oncolytic viruses  in many tumors  constant expression and release of type I IFN leads to a constitutively high level of unphosphorylated forms of STAT  STAT  and IRF  which together form an unphosphorylated but functional ISGF like complex that relocalizes to the nucleus and drives expression of a specific set of ISGs distinct from acute IFN I exposure   
These ISGs are sufficient to maintain a functional antiviral defense and they play a critical role in resistance to DNA damaging agents On a cellular level  virus replication is controlled by antiviral defense molecules    which in turn are primarily controlled by type I IFN signaling 
In addition to classical type I IFN  or cytokine induced antiviral signaling  tumors may employ other antiviral defense mechanisms 
For example  stromal cells may secrete peptides with antiviral properties called defensins   
The defensins are amphiphatic and typically  –  amino acids in length and interfere with viruses by physically binding to and disrupting virus particles and or by inducing antiviral responses in target cells via pattern recognition receptors 
At least oral squamous cell carcinomas were found to overexpress defensins compared to normal control tissues   
While the role of defensins in oncolytic virus infection of tumors is unclear  one study showed that the immune stimulating properties of defensins may be exploited to increase overall therapeutic efficacy 
In this study  expression of beta   defensin from a conditionally replicating adenovirus yielded a superior therapeutic entity compared to the unarmed parental virus via enhanced anti tumor immune responses mediated by TLR dependent activation of dendritic cells   In summary  human cancers display varying degrees of expression of antiviral proteins or their signaling regulators at baseline 
Some of these may increase in response to genotoxic anti cancer treatments 
In the next chapter we will highlight some of the consequences to oncolytic virotherapy of the heterogeneity in type I IFN responsiveness in tumor cells All oncolytic viruses tested to date display variable infectivity in different cancer cell lines 
This variability is likely at least partly dependent on type I IFN as most oncolytic viruses are IFN sensitive 
IFN secretion follows virus sensing by the cells via Toll like receptors expressed on both the plasma membrane and in endocytotic vesicles  NOD like receptors  STING  AIM  NLP inflammosome and other danger sensing molecules  summarized elsewhere   
While all viruses carry an arsenal of counteracting molecules    no virus goes completely undetected 
Even HSV amplicons  which are devoid of functional virus genes  induce a type I IFN response that mediates a STAT dependent system wide antiviral defense in mice within one hour of intravenous vector injection  resulting in significant reduction of transgene expression compared to expression in STAT  knockout animals   During our own studies with attenuated SFV vector VA  it became apparent that the dramatic and lasting therapeutic efficacy achieved following mere single intravenous  or intratumoral  injection of the virus in immunocompromised mice bearing human A  melanoma or U  glioma xenografts   was not going to be recapitulated easily in immunocompetent animals   
The paradox in our studies was that while oncolytic SFV vector VA  effectively replicated in and destroyed a variety of IFN responsive cancer cell lines in vitro  it consistently failed to eradicate tumors generated from the same cell types in vivo  even if large doses of virus were injected directly into the tumor mass and even if the tumors were void of visible physical barriers  Figure  
Conversely  only tumors generated from IFN unresponsive cancer cells have seemed infectable in vivo by VA  so far 
In light of earlier findings by others  showing that type I IFN receptor knockout mice are highly susceptible to SFV infection and quickly succumb to multi organ systemic infection    the parameters for oncolytic SFV efficacy seem clear  tumor cells must be defective in type I IFN response for the virus to be effective These findings are in line with emerging data from other groups  showing a remarkably strict dependence of oncolytic virus replication on defective type I IFN responsiveness  a dogma introduced at the turn of the  st century   
For example  sarcomas and melanomas display differing permissiveness to oncolytic VSV  an obstacle which may be overcome by blocking type I IFN signaling   
In eight sarcoma cell lines  basal up regulation of RIG I and IFIT  and rapid induction of STAT  phosphorylation upon IFN I treatment correlated with resistance to oncolytic measles virus   
In other studies  human pancreatic and ovarian cancer cells display resistance against Rb dependent oncolytic adenovirus  strongly correlating with intracellular levels of MxA  and acquired resistance to repeated oncolytic adenovirus injections in an intraperitoneal ovarian carcinoma model was associated with an increase in MxA as well as several other key ISGs in the tumors   
A study comparing normal human or mouse melanocytes to a panel of melanoma cells revealed strong correlation between permissiveness to oncolytic VSV and capacity to mount antiviral defense in response to type I IFN   
In this study  VSV rp  harboring two mutations in P and L genes  was superior to several other tested oncolytic VSV strains  but the dependence on defective IFN responsiveness was still retained 
In yet another study  oncolytic VSV replicated in four out of twelve mesothelioma cell lines which were unable to mount antiviral defense upon IFN beta pretreatment or to respond to infection by up regulation of PKR  MxA or  OAS mRNA   
In contrast  the non permissive mesothelioma cells mounted antiviral defense  associated with PKR  MxA or  OAS mRNA up regulation  in response to infection or to exogenous type I IFN 
The authors of this study further linked the observed pattern of virus resistance to clinical mesothelioma samples  where in a mesothelioma tissue array  significant variance in immunoreactivity against PKR  p  and or IFNAR was observed  with only a few samples displaying lack of reactivity against all three components  arguing that most tumors in clinical settings would display at least some level of resistance to oncolytic VSV Oncolytic adenoviruses are often deleted for E A  which normally binds Rb and prevents it from sequestering E F  which results in the viruses being unable to replicate in normal cells 
However  since adenovirus  as with all viruses  contains elements that antagonize antiviral defenses  such elements have also been targets for deletion to render the virus sensitive to innate antiviral defenses  which would be expected to remain intact only in normal cells 
Cancer cells expressing Ras may down regulate protein kinase R and inhibit type I IFN induction by interfering with RIG I signaling   
Also  select interferon stimulated genes appear to be repressed by the Ras MEK ERK signaling cascade   
PKR activation shuts down E F dependent translation  including translation of virus messenger RNAs 
Therefore  an adenovirus deleted for VA RNA  which antagonizes PKR  should be capable of replicating in Ras overexpressing  tumor  cells 
However  while this was seemingly the case    it was later discovered that Ras is not an obligatory determinant for PKR inactivation and that virus replication was halted even in Ras overexpressing cells via functional PKR mediated E F phosphorylation  implying that the parameters of VA RNA deleted adenovirus replication had to be revised   
Similar findings were obtained with oncolytic reovirus  against which Ras independent tumor resistance emerged in vivo   
Thus  under some circumstances even tumor cells over expressing Ras may respond to type I IFN or to stimulants of pattern recognition receptors  activating PKR and inhibiting virus translation 
To complicate matters  MEK inhibitors have been shown restore antiviral signaling capacity in Ras overexpressing tumors   
This implies that human tumors treated with MEK inhibitors  such as Trametinib which was recently approved for treatment of BRAF mutated melanoma  may be poor targets for oncolytic viruses as antiviral signaling capacity in such tumors may be restored Some oncolytic viruses  such as members of the poxvirus family  are seemingly resistant to the antiviral effects of type I IFNs in vitro and may be controlled by other cellular factors   
However  in most cases  sensitivity or resistance to type I IFN is assessed in vitro and using only one cytokine  which may mask synergies with other factors present in vivo 
One possible explanation for the in vitro–in vivo discrepancy is the tumor micro environment  which not only imposes physical barriers to oncolytic viruses but also alters intracellular antiviral defenses 
For example  glioma cells were found in the brain to spontaneously secrete type I IFN  which conferred resistance against oncolytic HSV 
Resistance was linked to ECM protein CCN  interaction with glioma cell surface receptor alpha   beta   integrin  which activated interferon secretion   
It is tempting to speculate whether this or a similar ECM glioma interaction could have contributed to the resistance of syngeneic glioma cells we observed in vivo but not in vitro to both oncolytic SFV and vaccinia virus  FIG    
Also  while critical in many respects  antiviral signaling may occur without signaling via type I IFN receptor  IFNAR 
For instance  upon infection of IFNAR KO mice with murine hepatitis virus  MHV  brain cells were found to have upregulated antiviral GTPase TGTP and IFITm  and IFITm  all of which have confirmed antiviral activity in vivo against a variety of viruses   
In these cases  IFN gamma and TNF alpha likely account for at least part of the observed ISG activity  where e g  TGTP is upregulated by IFN γ signaling and TNFα has been shown to induce ISG  independently of IFNAR   Interestingly  while most cancers are heterogeneous in antiviral defence signaling  one broad class of tumors in particular may display consistently low capacity to ward off oncolytic viruses  oncovirus induced cancers 
This is because oncoviruses  as all viruses  carry a complement of factors that abrogate antiviral sensors and effectors  which may result in tumors that are uniformly devoid of antiviral signaling 
In an intriguing study  oncolytic VSV infected and destroyed human papilloma virus  HPV positive cervical carcinoma cells more effectively than HPV negative head  and neck cancer cells due to HPV E mediated suppression of antiviral signaling   
HPV positive or E expressing xenografts were efficiently eradicated from nude mice following VSV injection 
The potential of this approach is that even oncolytic viruses that are extremely sensitive to type I IFN  such as attenuated SFV or M mutated VSV  may function well against oncovirus induced cancers where the oncovirus machinery ensures the lack of antiviral defense While on first thought it would appear counterintuitive to antagonize the very factors that keep oncolytic viruses tumor specific  emerging data shows that this can be accomplished in a safe way 
One of the foremost strategies to increase oncolytic virus efficacy is to combine them with drugs that lower tumor antiviral defenses 
In this regard  a primary target for interference is the prototypical type I IFN signaling cascade 
While small molecular inhibitors against IFNAR are not available  activity of downstream signaling transducers may effectively be blocked 
Human pancreatic cancer cells were shown to constitutively express high levels of MxA and OAS and to mount type I IFN dependent resistance to oncolytic VSV 
Resistance could be overcome by blocking activity of IFNAR associated Janus kinase  JAK      
Similarly  JAK  inhibitor ruxolitinib overcame type I IFN dependent resistance of human SCC  head and neck cancer cells against oncolytic VSV   
Ruxolitinib also successfully abrogated type I IFN mediated antiviral effects elicited by macrophages    highlighting that this drug might also alleviate type I IFN dependent tumor resistance to oncolytic viruses imposed by stromal cells 
However  the obvious downside to using JAK inhibitors is their effects on critical host defense mechanisms  which may result in increased infection of normal cells 
Moreover  JAK inhibitors may reduce anti tumor immune responses elicited by oncolytic virotherapy 
For example  ruxolitinib was shown to impair the capacity of dendritic cells promote CD  T cell responses against model tumor antigens   
On the other hand  in this study clearance of adenovirus was delayed in ruxolitinib treated normal animals  which makes it difficult to predict the overall impact of JAK inhibitors on tumor therapy where prolonged virus presence might translate to better therapeutic efficacy 
Also  while the immune stimulating and anti tumor effects of type I and type II interferons may be adversely affected by JAK inhibitors  central tumor promoting cascades mediated by JAKs  such as IL STAT  may also be inhibited    yielding a difficult to predict net therapeutic outcome 
At the moment  more studies are needed to establish the overall impact of interference with JAK  signaling in cancer therapy Spurred by earlier reports of oncovirus reactivation and promoter enhancement by histone deacetylase  HDAC  inhibitors  this class of agents was assessed for capacity to enhance oncolytic virus potency by inhibiting antiviral responses 
Indeed  such enhancement was observed with oncolytic VSV and SFV  and while it has been difficult to pinpoint the exact mechanisms that underlie HDAC inhibitor enhancement of oncolytic virus replication in cancer cells  antiviral defenses in general are inhibited for yet unknown reasons mainly in cancer cells and not in normal cells  which indirectly facilitates virus replication   
Interestingly  combination of HDAC inhibitors with conditionally replicating   E A deleted adenovirus gave improved virus replication rate and therapeutic efficacy in subcutaneous xenograft models only when the inhibitors were given before the virus  otherwise inhibition of replication was observed   
Similarly  HDAC inhibitors increased replication and oncolytic efficacy of HSV when given before the virus but not when given at the same time   
With nuclear DNA viruses  such as adenovirus and HSV  it is possible that HDAC inhibitors also alter virus genome accessibility to transcription factors  resulting in reduced replication or other adverse effects  implying that with these viruses HDAC inhibitors should be administered before the viruses Recently  it was found that HDAC inhibitor vorinostat activates NfκB signaling by facilitating hyperacetylation of the p  subunit  which in turn activates cellular autophagy   
Autophagy was in another study shown to be important for VSV replication  presumably by inhibiting antiviral signaling 
This is interesting  as a previous study revealed enhancement of VSV replication by inhibiting TNF alpha induced antiviral signaling mediated by p  using NfκB inhibitors BMS  or TPCA    
In this study  neither inhibitor had an effect on STAT  or STAT  phosphorylation or their nuclear relocalization in response to type I IFN but the authors observed clear induction of ISG  GBP  and MX  in response to type I IFN in U  glioma cells  with the latter two being dependent on NfκB signaling 
Taken together  NfκB pathway activation may result in different antiviral responses in different cancer types  and inhibition or enhancement of oncolytic viruses by NfκB inhibitors is dependent on other concomitant cellular mechanisms  such as autophagy Since HDAC inhibitors modulate promoter activity accessibility  it is conceivable other epigenetic or promoter modifying agents could work in a similar manner to repress antiviral defense induction and enhance oncolytic viruses   
DNA demethylating agents  azacytidine  Aza  and decitabine synergized with oncolytic herpes simplex type   virus in glioma models in vitro and in vivo  as did HDAC inhibitor valproic acid  VPA  which was already shown before to work well with oncolytic HSV as well as several other oncolytic viruses   
Moreover  inhibition of cancer antiviral defenses  specifically RNAseL and PKR  resulted when cancer cells were exposed to sunitinib  a multi tyrosine kinase inhibitor originally developed as an inhibitor of VEGF R and PDGF R signaling  yielding strong anti tumor synergy with IFN sensitive oncolytic VSV   
Since sunitinib is approved for renal cell carcinoma and imatinib resistant gastric cancers  combination with oncolytic VSV constitutes a promising and clinically relevant approach warranting further investigation 
Interstingly  sunitinib as well as several other receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors displayed antiviral effects against polyomavirus BK    arguing that these compounds are not universal virus enhancers Cyclophosphamide  CPA  is a general immunosuppressant used to minimize Treg presence during immunotherapy and also oncolytic virotherapy 
CPA may  however  also enhance replication and efficacy of oncolytic viruses by diminishing cytokine secretion by stromal cells  including type I IFN   
Another compound enhancing oncolytic virus efficacy by lowering cell responsiveness to type I IFN is triptolide  which acts downstream of IRF  activation   
Further  the kinase mammalian target of rapamycin  mTOR  enhances the antiviral effects of type I IFN by activation of its effector proteins  E BP  which binds and inactivates translation factor eIF E  and S K  which carries out cell type specific signaling functions of type I IFN  such as activation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor  B and promotion of ISG  transcription 
Consequently  rapamycin was able to enhance oncolytic VSV replication and anti tumor efficacy by inhibiting type I IFN mediated antiviral signaling via mTOR   Several other compounds synergizing with oncolytic viruses have been identified via high throughput drug library screening  many of which seem to act by antagonizing antiviral defenses 
For instance  a novel virus sensitizer  Vse  was found to greatly diminish antiviral effects of type I IFN against oncolytic VSV in several cancer cell types  and the drug also synergized with the virus in subcutaneous mouse tumor models   
For many of these new compounds  the mechanism of action is still poorly understood  necessitating extensive safety studies to exclude undesirable effects against normal cells Apart from classical type I IFN induced antiviral defenses  which typically prevent virus translation and degrade virus genomes  other cellular machineries regulate oncolytic virus efficacy 
Notably  strategies to increase cancer cell death in response to oncolytic viruses have been tested 
In a recent study  a class of compounds called SMAC mimetics synergized in several cancer models with oncolytic VSV by removing cancer cell block to apoptosis in response to virus induced type I IFN  TNF α or TRAIL   
Interestingly  since virus infection triggered cytokines act on nearby non infected cells  SMAC mimetics may in combination with oncolytic viruses also cause significant bystander tumor destruction 
Normal cells are not affected by the IFN SMAC mimetic synergy  providing an important safety aspect 
In another study  blocking the ER stress response circuitry triggered by oncolytic rhabdovirus infection by a small molecular inhibitor of serine threonine protein kinase and endoribonuclease IRE α  which was identified in a genome wide siRNA screen  greatly enhanced cytotoxicity via caspase induced apoptosis and increased oncolytic efficacy in refractory tumor models in mice   
This effect was independent on induction or responsiveness to type I IFN 
Conversely  inhibitors of nucleoside transporter   ENT  were discovered from a high throughput screen of enhancers of oncolytic HSV  and to date such inhibitors have not been reported to alter cellular antiviral responses   
Other compounds  such as common chemotherapeutics  and their mechanisms synergizing with oncolytic viruses have been discussed elsewhere for most of them the possible role of antiviral defense antagonism in enhancing oncolytic virus efficacy remains to be studied   Thus  many compounds are available to interfere with tumor antiviral defenses 
The outstanding question for most of them  however  seems to be why such compounds do not render normal cells sensitive to oncolytic viruses 
Elucidation of the exact mechanisms of action and the differences between normal and cancer cells constitute a worthy goal for studies in the near future Already in the  s it became clear that using certain pathogenic wildtype viruses  such as West Nile virus and Bunyamwera virus  in cancer patients would result in off target toxicity   
Characteristic for pathogenic viruses is a greater ability to circumvent or antagonize cellular innate antiviral defenses than attenuated strains 
For example  unlike the prototypical oncolytic reovirus strain type   Dearing  the T L strain of reovirus causes accumulation of IRF  in the nucleus and inhibits activation of a select group of ISGs yet because of this property the T L strain is myocarditic unlike the oncolytic type   Dearing strain   
For these reasons  many oncolytic viruses used today  such as reovirus type   Dearing  oncolytic strains of Newcastle disease virus and M mutated VSV have either a stronger capacity to induce or a weaker capacity to resist antiviral type I IFN than the corresponding wildtype strains   An open question  however  is whether strain specific or virus specific differences that relate to specific components of the cellular antiviral machinery may be exploited for greater anti tumor efficacy  i e  if one virus fails  could another be used in its stead 
While Ras expression was critical for oncolytic reovirus replication in cells overexpressing CUG  oncogene  oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus was unable to replicate in the same cells due to increased activation of STAT  and OASL    
Thus  in these cells reovirus was not affected by STAT  or OASL  and it therefore remains interesting to see which other antiviral effectors may have been lacking in the CUG expressing cells and  conversely  how reovirus and VSV differ in terms of sensitivity to antiviral effectors 
While several oncolytic viruses have been compared to each other in terms of replication rate and cytotoxicity  systematic studies with regard to tumor antiviral defenses have not been conducted As any attenuated virus is likely to replicate effectively only in its own niche  i e  to be restricted by a specific set of ISGs  and as wild type strains may be too toxic for use in humans  a compromise may be achieved by incorporating select elements from wild type viruses into oncolytic virus backbones 
Indeed  several chimeric and recombinant viruses have been generated that harbor specific elements of wild type strains or even of other unrelated viruses in order to better resist cancer antiviral defenses  Table  
As an example of introducing wild type elements into attenuated viruses  Haralambieva reported on a measles virus Edmonston vaccine strain in which P gene was replaced with the counterpart from the wild type IC B strain   
Later  Meng et al 
included N  P  and L genes from wild type measles in Edmonston backbone  producing an enhanced but still safe oncolytic virus   
Edmonston vaccine virus induces a more robust IFN response compared to wild type measles virus partly due to the weaker ability of V protein to suppress MDA mediated activation of IRF  and IFN I induction   
In vivo  P gene encoded proteins  particularly V  control the quality of the cytokine response to measles so that vaccine strains qualitatively induce a stronger inflammatory response compared to WT strains  where WT V protein suppresses multiple cytokine secretion 
V protein short cytoplasmic tail has been shown to bind and inactivate STAT  IRF  MDA  and the Rel homology domain of the NfκB subunit p  but not of p    
Also  V causes LGP  protein to bind and inactivate RIG I    but it seemingly does not interfere with TICAM   TRIF  multiple TLR adaptor  including TLR mediated IFN β induction 
Thus  if cancer and normal cells would differ with regard to TICAM  or IRF  then such a virus could potentially target specifically cancer cells rather than normal cells 
So far  the measles Edmonston WT chimeras have proven safe in animals As an example of heterologous virus constructs  lentogenic Newcastle disease virus engineered to express influenza virus PR   H N  NS  showed enhanced oncolytic efficacy in vivo due to dampening of antiviral responses   
While such a virus did not display enhanced pathogenicity in that study  a mesogenic NDV virus harboring NS  from influenza strain H N  did show increased pathogenicity in chickens as well as an increased ability to replicate in human cells    raising some cautionary warnings for future engineering of similar replicative viruses 
As another example  vaccinia virus soluble type I IFN scavenger B R  NOTE  B R is often used in the literature  has been engineered into both oncolytic HSV and oncolytic rhabdoviruses  resulting in all cases in more effective therapy agents without loss of tumor specificity   
Oncolytic γ  gene deleted HSV was complemented by two different PKR antagonists from human cytomegalovirus  TRS  and IRS  generating a chimera capable of reaching wild type virus replication levels in cancer cells in vitro and in tumor models in vivo   The selection of various viral IFN I antagonists that potentially could be used to augment attenuated oncolytic viruses is vast   
For example  increased replication of several viruses  including HIV  Sindbis virus and E deleted adenovirus in mammalian cells was observed when the cells were engineered to express vaccinia virus E L protein  influenza A virus NS  protein  ebola virus VP  protein or HIV  Tat protein   
The choice of antagonist must primarily be made with safety in mind  but virus specific and cell specific differences in antagonist functions may potentially be exploited rationally when considering the overall combination 
For example  vaccinia virus E L is able to rescue VSV but not EMCV from exogenous IFN  whereas vaccinia virus K L partially rescued EMCV but not VSV   In anticipation of systematic  perhaps bioinformatically guided   super chimera  studies  two or more viruses that may complement each other s shortcomings in antiviral defense antagonism have been considered 
Notably  vaccinia virus was favorably combined with IFN I sensitive oncolytic VSV and SFV  yielding tumor model dependent increases in overall therapy efficacy that were dependent on vaccinia virus antagonism of type I IFN responses  which increased the replication of the IFN sensitive viruses   
Such heterologous virotherapy approaches may also be used to generate immunological synergy  similar to heterologous prime boost vaccination  anti tumor immune responses may be increased due to targeting of the tumor by two different viruses  on two separate occasions  but anti virus immune responses would be generated against different viruses each time  avoiding the problem of neutralizing immunity to and predominance of antivirus immune responses   
Some other ideas explored experimentally include engineering oncolytic viruses to express other oncolytic viruses 
For example  the entire oncolytic parvovirus H  genome was placed under a regulatable promoter in oncolytic adenovirus  resulting in a more effective therapeutic entity than either virus alone without loss of tumor specificity   
The genetic material of Semliki Forest virus replicons has been engineered into adenovirus and vaccinia virus backbones   and several other virus chimeras have been constructed   
However  the effects on tumor antiviral defenses of such a constructs remain to be studied The attribute  oncolytic  implies for a virus that it infects and  indeed  lyses the infected tumor 
This property is primarily tested in vitro in cultured tumor cells 
We have learned  however  that in the native tumor microenvironment in living hosts many viruses are no longer able to infect tumor cells or to kill them even if they manage to infect them 
Tightly packed tumor cells and the network of supportive molecules of the extracellular matrix form a physical barrier to virus particle diffusion 
It has also become evident that the tumor cells themselves may be much more capable of thwarting oncolytic virus advances than previously thought  with some tumor cells residing in a seemingly permanent non permissive antiviral state 
Tumors harbor multiple cell types in addition to the neoplastic cells  which may promote and propagate both physical and cellular virus resistance 
As the efficacy of virotherapy in human cancer patients still falls shy of the achievements in animal models  it appears quite plausible that one or more of the barriers described in this review indeed constitute a real and formidable obstacle for oncolytic virus advancement into routine clinical use 
Fortunately  some of the most difficult barriers have been identified  and a rapidly expanding arsenal of countermeasures is at our disposal 
Our task is now to separate the wheat from the chaff and to systematically evaluate the proposed combination regimens that will yield the best results without compromising patient safety Evidence of prenatal toxicity of herbal based indigenous formulations for sex selection in rat modelsTraditional or indigenous preparations  IPs  are getting considerable attention in global health debates  It continues to be used widely in several countries and its consumption is rapidly increasing 
 
  Many reports have documented the use of such preparations 
For instance  in China  traditional herbal medicines played a critical role during the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome  SARS  In fact  many drugs in modern medicine had their roots in the traditional system of medicine 
Drugs like Penicillin  from Penicillium fungi  and Digoxin  from Digitalis purpurea  are some such examples 
One of the promising therapies for Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus  MRSA  infection is a ninth century treatment for eye infections which is a recipe consisting of garlic and onions  wine  and bile from a cow s stomach brewed in a brass cauldron 
It is however important to note that culture specific practices are not always safe 
Digitalis is a classic example where herbalists use this plant in allopathic treatment strategies  while in some countries such as Britain  law restricts their vast availability  A report from Australia describes the adverse effects of ‘herbal  preparations or IPs  Problems arise when people do not report about the consumption of such preparations assuming that these are devoid of any side effects by virtue of them being natural products  The need for research in this field is huge and scientific research into the quality  safety  molecular effects and clinical efficacy is crucial 
 
 
Pregnancy is considered a time of minimal intervention  and a period when herbal medicines are usually contraindicated  It is reported that many women consume indigenous medicines  that contains Bryonia laciniosa  Quercus infectoria and Putranjiva roxburghii along with other ingredients  during early pregnancy to beget a male child in India 
These preparations  often called sex selection drugs  SSD  contain herbal ingredients but these are off the label prescriptions and hence cannot be certified as ‘herbal  medicines 
The prevalence of consumption varies from   to as high as         Studies have indicated that there is  –  times higher risk of birth defects including major malformations of internal organs like urogenital and renal malformation  trachea esophageal fistula  and visible defects like spina bifida  cleft lip palate and imperforate anus 
 
  Risk of stillbirths also increases   folds 
Studies suggest that a single exposure during pregnancy can be deleterious 
 
 
 
  SSDs are reported to contain phytoestrogens  steroids and heavy metals 
 
 
 
  It is also known that although placenta serves as a barrier  most drugs and environmental chemicals enter the foetal circulation by passive diffusion or active transport  However  despite growing evidence on deleterious effects of these herbal formulations  few studies have attempted to systematically understand the risk of such preparations using animal models 
Genetic sex of a child is determined at the time of conception by the fertilization of the ovum with X or Y sperms and intake of so called preparations for sex selection can never alter that In view of these  the current study was conducted with an objective to determine the embryo foetal and development toxicity of SSDs following maternal exposure during critical period of organogenesis using a small animal model The study was guided by the OECD guidelines for testing of chemicals  Guideline no    adopted on  nd January   Prenatal Developmental Toxicity Study  and was based on a mutually approved protocol 
Personal protection equipment was employed as required while handling the test system The test facility is registered and renewed  No 
 PO RcBi S CPCSEA dated July     for breeding and to conduct research on animals for commercial purpose by the committee for the purpose of control and supervision of experiments on animals  CPCSEA  Ministry of Environment  Forests and Climate Change  Government of India 
The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee  Venus Medicine Research Center 
Due permission was taken from the Ethics Committee of Indian Institute of Public Health Delhi For this experiment  strain of Sprague Dawley of rats  Rattus norvegicus  was used 
The number of dams per group was   instead of   as laid down under OECD guidelines 
Rats of both sexes  –  g  were obtained from National Institute of Biologicals  India at  –  weeks of age  acclimatized for five days and then subjected to the experiment at  –  weeks of age 
They were housed in standard polypropylene rat cages with stainless steel top grill  one dam per cage  at a temperature of       °C  with  –  relative humidity 
Bedding material and cages were changed once in six days and   hourly light dark cycle was followed 
Animals were identified by their existing ear numbering 
Cages were labelled by tags indicating the study number  sex  group of the animals  experimental start and completion dates 
Standard pelleted feed  from Ashirwad Industries  Mohali  India  was provided ad libitum to all the animals 
They also had free access to purified water via drinking bottles throughout the study 
The feed  cages and drinking bottles were not analysed for the presence of phytoestrogens and bisphenol A 
However  similar materials were used for all the rats across all groups The drug comprised of IPs for sex selection  SSD 
These non branded locally made preparations are made available  –  days after placing an order and are never sold openly 
These preparations essentially contain herbal ingredients such as Shivlingi  Bryonia laciniosa  Majuphal  Quercus infectoria  Putrajeevak  Putranjiva roxburghii  Nagkesar  Mesua ferrea  and feather of peacock  Pavo cristatus 
A total of   such samples of SSDs were procured from varied sources like ‘pansari  shop owners  grocers  local alternative medicine practitioners  rickshaw pullers  drivers and commoners from different states 
SSDs are advised to be consumed between   and   weeks of pregnancy The samples were categorized into   groups based on redundancy of the preparations and common ingredients reported 
This was followed by chemical analysis in an accredited laboratory to detect the presence of phytoestrogens and steroids 
Since we explored the toxic effects of these preparations we wanted to select two samples that would be most predictive of toxicity 
Due to resource constraints  we did not want to subject all the   samples for animal study 
Hence  three samples of SSDs  found to be most rich in phenols and steroids were selected for toxicity study  All the three samples were also tested for heavy metals which suggested that Lead and Mercury were in very high quantities  The toxicity was examined using C  elegans  an alternate animal model 
Survival analysis and reproductive toxicity was assessed from the brood size and progeny count assay  The two SSDs that were found to be most toxic were selected as test items for the subsequent study in rat models 
SSD   was reported to contain Shivlingi and Putrajeevak while SSD   contained Shivlingi  Majuphal  Putrajeevak  Nagkesar and feathers of peacock 
Both the samples were obtained from grocers 
Local preparations like these are bound to have certain degree of variability in concentrations but more often than not  these remain the major ingredients According to studies reported  women consume such preparations along with cow s milk in dosages and schedule that are quite varied 
While some advise these IPs to be consumed for one day  others prescribe it for   days  to be taken thrice a day 
We considered the amount of SSDs most commonly reported by pregnant women  weighing   kg  which was  –  g daily for   days 
The dose of the test item   mg kg  was calculated by using conversion factor of  Conversion factor is the ratio of the correction factors  estimated by dividing the average body weight in kgs of species by the body surface area in m  of the species  Km 
Human equivalent dose  HED in mg kg    Animal dose  mg kg  X correction factor  Km animal Km human 
Kms of every species are constant 
For humans it is    assuming average weight of adults to be   kg a surface area of   m  and for rats it is  Therefore  HED   mg  kg    animal dose X  
Or  animal dose         mg kg           mg kg Since pregnant women consume these orally  these were administered to rats by oral route The test items were coded as SSD   and SSD   and were provided to the experimental laboratory  Venus Medicine Research Center  Baddi  in powder form 
On the day of dosing  the doses were administered between  –  h  The test items were administered in fresh cow s milk at a final volume of   ml kg 
The doses were calculated on the basis of the latest body weight recorded for the study 
A stainless steel gavage cannula fitted to a calibrated syringe was used for dosing the animals For control animals  cow s milk was used as a vehicle while feeding The study was performed in two phases to evaluate the effect of SSD consumption duration during gestation period Adult  nulliparous female rats were mated with males of same species and strain in  
Each morning  dams were examined for the presence of a vaginal plug and vaginal smear was taken from each dam by using pipette smear technique 
The day of vaginal plug formation or sperms observed in vaginal smear  also known as successful mating  were considered as GD   Gestation day  
The mated females were housed individually in clear polycarbonate cages with stainless steel wire lids 
Mating process was carried out to result in   pregnant animals per group 
Successfully mated females were randomized into control and treatment groups 
All the rats were sacrificed on GD  
According to OECD guidelines  the test chemical should be administered daily from implantation to the day prior to scheduled caesarean section in order to assess toxicity 
Test chemicals were administered to pregnant animals and sacrificed as per the schedule  which was as close as possible to the normal day of delivery without risking loss of data resulting from early delivery i e GD  
The females were killed  before caesarean section  the uterine contents were examined  and the fetuses were evaluated for soft tissue and skeletal changes The pregnant rats were randomized to two intervention and one control groups 
SSD was given during pre implantation to implantation stage  GD  – 
Each group of rats was treated either with vehicle  G  VC  SSD   G    mg kg  or SSD   G    mg kg SSDs were given from GD  – 
Each group of rats was treated with either vehicle or SSD  or SSD 
Allocation of animals was randomized to the following groups  G   Control  VC  G   SSD    mg kg  G   SSD    mg kg  G   SSD    mg kg  G   SSD    mg kg  G SSD    mg kg  G   SSD    mg kg The following parameters were observed •Clinical Signs  Animals were observed once after successful mating or on GD  and after administration of the first dose 
Cage side observations for clinical signs of toxicity in the animals were recorded once daily until the day before necropsy •Body weight  Body weight of all experimental animals were recorded once before mating  initial body weight  and then after confirmation of mating 
Body weights were recorded on days               and on terminal day before sacrifice 
These recorded body weights were used for calculating the dose volume to be administered •Food consumption  Food consumption was evaluated once after successful mating or on day   of gestation  the day of vaginal plug formation or sperms observed in vaginal smear  and on days             and one day prior to sacrifice 
Calculated amount of feed were placed in the trough of each cage and the quantity of feed remaining after approximately   h were weighed and recorded •Morbidity Mortality  All the animals were observed twice daily  once in the morning between   and   h and once in the evening between   and   h  for incidence of morbidity and or mortality •Maternal examination related parameters  At the end of the observation period  all the dams were sequentially euthanized  by CO  asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation  and subjected to gross necropsy 
After termination  dams were examined macroscopically for any structural abnormalities or pathological changes 
Blinding was done while evaluation of the dams during caesarean section and subsequent foetal analyses to minimize bias 
Pregnancy rate was calculated as the proportion of mated pairs that had produced at least one pregnancy within a fixed period where pregnancy was determined by the earliest available evidence that fertilization has occurred 
Gestation index was calculated to indicate number of females with live born as a proportion of number of females with evidence of pregnancy •Examination of uterine contents  Immediately after termination  the uteri were removed and the pregnancy status of the animals ascertained 
Gravid uteri including the cervix were weighed  and number of corpora lutea were determined 
The uterine contents were examined for numbers of embryonic or foetal deaths and live foetuses 
The degree of resorption was described in order to estimate the relative time of death of the conceptus 
Any increase in the number of resorption and or implantation loss is an indicator of litter size for the individual dam •Examination of foetuses  The sex and weight of each foetus were determined 
Approximately one half of each litter were prepared and examined for skeletal alterations from selected dams 
The remainder were prepared and examined for soft tissue alterations  using accepted or appropriate serial sectioning methods or careful gross dissection techniques 
Each foetus was examined for external alterations 
Foetuses were examined for skeletal alterations  using Alizarin Red S staining method 
The fetuses for skeletal staining were kept in pre labelled plastic containers containing   ethanol before staining 
After skinning  we processed the foetus for staining by immersing in   alcian blue   GX for three days  then performed rehydration through a gradient series of ethanol   ethanol   –  h twice    ethanol   –  h  ethanol   –  h  distilled water until the samples sank to the bottom of a conical tube 
Samples were further treated with   KOH for  –  days or until it became clear and again treated with   alizarin red for next  –  days until bones became purple 
Samples were rinsed   times in   KOH  for  –  h at each time point 
Samples were further treated with a gradient series of glycerol  KOH    h   glycerol   h X  Visceral examination was done by micro dissection technique 
Fetuses were preserved in   formalin until they became fixed 
An illuminated magnifier was used for visceral examination 
We placed the foetus in a supine position on a paraffin wax block tray covered with paraffin wax  secured the fetal limbs by paper pins to the paraffin wax block  made a ventral midline incision from the umbilicus  cutting caudally to the genital tubercle and cranially to the diaphragm 
Once incision was completed  we located the ventral attachment of the diaphragm and lifted the liver carefully to examine the diaphragm for abnormal opening 
After observation  the diaphragm was clipped 
We gave a longitudinal cut to open the rib cage slightly lateral to and on the right of the sternebrae and then extended the cut anteriorly to neck region 
The rib cage was opened gently and secured to the paraffin block petridish tray with pins Foetuses were examined for soft tissue alterations  e g 
variations and malformations or anomalies  using Wilson s Technique 
The fetal viscera were examined sequentially  beginning with thoracic organs and moving caudally 
We performed hearts cuts after completion of other observations 
We examined the bilobed thymus for size  shape  coloration and presence of haemorrhages and then removed it for observation of trachea and esophagus 
We observed the lungs for size  color and number of lobes  observed the trachea  esophagus for normal alignment and presence of fistula  opened the pericardial sac and cut off pericardium to expose the heart for observation 
We checked the size  shape  color of the heart and normal development of major blood vessels 
After observation of thoracic viscera  we observed the abdominal viscera and liver for size  shape  color  texture  and number of lobes 
External anatomy of heart was examined by making two incisions using micro dissecting scissors We examined the stomach  spleen  pancreas  small and large intestines for size  position or any other developmental anomalies 
The intestines were moved aside after observation for seeing the underlying structures 
Ureters were checked for normal size and location and for continuity from the renal hilus to the urinary bladder 
One kidney was cut transversely and another was longitudinally to examine renal papilla and renal pelvis 
To confirm the sex of the foetus  the gonads were inspected carefully 
We examined the reproductive organs for size  shape and location GraphPad Prism® statistical software version   was used to analyze the data and all the results were represented as mean   S E M 
Intergroup variance for most of the parameters was calculated by one way analysis of variance  ANOVA  followed by Tukey s test 
A value of p     was regarded statistically significant 
Linear regression was performed to examine the weight change of dams during pregnancy for each group comparing with the control after adjusting for the litter size 
The malformations were analysed by performing Chi square test for trend for two groups  SSD  G  G  G  G  and SSD  G  G  G  G The ARRIVE guidelines were followed to report the findings 
In phase   pre natal study  all the dams dosed with SSD  and SSD  had normal food intake and weight gain 
The average gain in weight from GD  to GD   was       gms for controls while it was       gms in SSD   and       gms in SSD 
 Webtable  
No test item related mortality or clinical sign of toxicity was encountered during the study 
All dams in treatment groups and control group survived to scheduled terminal sacrifice 
They showed normal behaviour until euthanized 
There were no differences in mean maternal body weights  body weight gains  pregnancy rate  gestational index  pre and post implantation loss  and resorptions 
No significant differences were observed in foetal sex ratio  foetal body weights 
However  one dam from SSD  had all male foetuses 
No abnormality was detected in skeletal and visceral examination In phase   controls and SSD  and SSD  treated dams exhibited a comparable food intake  Table  
 
However  a dose response relationship was observed with reduced weight gain with higher doses of SSDs 
 Table  
 
Two dams  one in G   SSD    mg kg  and the other in G   SSD    mg kg  categories showed decreased or consistent body weight GD  onwards 
On an average  the weight on GD   was       gms in controls while it was       with SSD    mg kg  and       gms with SSD    mg kg 
The adjusted analysis indicated that except in G  there was a significant reduction in weight gain in all the intervention groups as compared to the control group after controlling for litter size  Table  
 During follow up  one dam from SSD    mg kg  and one from SSD    mg kg  showed haematuria during gestational day  – 
However  no another clinical sign of toxicity was encountered during the study 
All the dams in treatment and control groups showed normal behaviour and survived to scheduled terminal sacrifice 
In phase   pregnancy rate and gestational index were found to be   at all dose levels with SSD  whereas  in SSD  it decreased to   in G   SSD    mg kg  and G   SSD    mg kg  groups 
One dam from G   SSD    mg kg  and another one from G   SSD    mg kg  group showed mating confirmation during vaginal smear examination and showed positive sign in initial days of pregnancy but during necropsy on expected day of delivery  GD   no foetus was found 
Body weights of dams increased in the initial stages that became constant at a later period 
To reconfirm it  non gravid uterus was stained in salewski strain and presence of conceptus was found 
This indicated the possibility of miscarriage Increased pre and post implantation losses as well as resorptions and reduced live foetuses were observed with both SSD  and SSD 
No significant differences were observed in foetal sex ratio  but decreased foetal body weights were noted in both sexes 
On an average one early resorption in a group was a normal observation 
More than one late resorption was observed in all treatment groups while there was none in the control group 
Total count of live foetuses count was significantly reduced with SSD  and SSD  treatment in a dose dependent manner 
Total number of live foetuses were reduced up to   in SSD  at   mg kg treatment group and   in SSD  at   mg kg treatment group Both SSD  and SSD s at different dose levels showed decreased fetal weight in dose dependent manner  although the difference was not significant 
Skeletal and soft tissue alterations were observed in both treatment groups 
In general  the embryo–foetal examination showed abnormalities  which could have caused some functional damage to these foetuses if allowed to grow in the normal course 
In visceral examinations  slight dilation of the renal pelvis  reduced papilla size  urinary bladder hypertrophy was observed in few foetuses from both SSD  and SSD  treatment groups 
Few incidences of foetal soft tissue abnormalities encountered in this study were normal variants 
Skeletal examination showed variations in the ossification patterns like incomplete or poorly ossified skulls  ossification of sternebra  cleavage ossification of thoracic centrum  asymmetric thoracic centrum  and supernumerary rib in many foetuses in SSD  and SSD  groups  Table  
 
A trend was noted with increased incidence of certain malformations with increasing dosages of SSDs that was statistically significant for most malformations with SSD The results of this developmental toxicity study suggest that administration of SSDs to pregnant rats had significant impact on intrauterine foetal growth  early and late resorption as well as developmental anomalies 
These formulations have teratogenic potential but does not affect sex ratio IPs contain phytoestrogens like diadzein and genistein  In vitro rat whole embryo culture assay  WEC  studies of genistein in rats have indicated fetotoxic and teratogenic potential at concentration of ≥  μg mL  However  in vivo  an oral  gavage  embryonic and fetal development pilot study could not demonstrate any teratogenic effect in the same study 
These findings are different from our study probably because we used SSDs containing natural herbal and non herbal ingredients unlike those studies where synthetic genistein was used 
In both the studies  decreased body weight was observed indicating slight maternal toxicity 
Food consumption was unaffected in our study which is contrary to what was reported 
In another study  pregnant rats exposed to oral isoflavones  diadzein and genistein in varying combinations  showed alterations in the number of live foetuses  lysed foetuses  number of resorption sites  and implantation sites while no clinical signs suggestive of maternal toxicity  seizures  tremors and salivation  that was observed similar to our study 
Maternal mass gain was significantly reduced in rats treated with   mg kg of isoflavones  Ratio of females to males in the litter of different groups was similar akin to our finding  These observations clearly nullify the claim that consumption of SDDs could alter the sex of the growing foetus 
An analysis done by the same authors earlier revealed that SSDs contain testosterone and steroids 
 
  The prenatal testosterone in pregnancy is known to affect sexual development adversely      The principles of reproductive biology state that the genetic sex of an individual is determined at the time of conception and can never be altered under any circumstances 
However  phenotypic sex of the growing foetus is likely to be influenced by the hormonal milieu of in utero environment 
Our analysis was confined to phenotypic sex only and hence it is difficult to state if any differences existed with reference to genetic and phenotypic sex 
This requires further inquiry Evidence on the effects of SSDs on humans should best be obtained from human beings 
The findings of the current study corroborate well with the evidence generated from observational studies in human beings      Presence of skeletal and visceral malformations could explain why stillbirths are likely to be more in women who consume SSDs 
The dosing of the test drugs was intended not only to examine the period of organogenesis solely but to assess effects from preimplantation  through the entire period of gestation to the day before caesarean section 
The results were based on observations of more than   female animals with implantation sites at necropsy that added to its strength 
Unnecessary handling of pregnant animals as well as any stressors from outside was avoided 
At least three dose levels and a concurrent vehicle control were used with dams randomly allocated to different treatment groups that support the validity of the results 
However  absence of   rats per group does not support it to be a fully OECD compliant study 
We did follow the principles of Good Laboratory Practices  GLP  but due to constraints of resources the study could not be conducted as a GLP compliant study  though this is optimal for academic interests There is a lack of systematic approach to assess the safety and effectiveness of herbal preparations 
Ingredients for herbal medicines are often drawn from different sources and are used in combination  which may exhibit variability in terms of species  growing conditions  and biologically active constituents 
To isolate each active ingredient from each herb and then to establish its toxicity is time consuming  resource intensive and not practical 
Moreover  drug approval process does not accommodate undifferentiated mixtures  Though important  it surpasses the herb herb interaction and the potentiating effect of one compound over another 
Therefore  in our study  we administered the herbal mixture to assess the effects 
Real time evaluations have yielded important observations for several herbal drugs especially related to pregnancy 
For instance  Wang et al 
  used mice model to evaluate the adverse pregnancy outcomes after maternal exposure to the herbal medicines  particularly during early pregnancy  The major events included maternal and perinatal mortality 
Maternal weight gain  embryo growth and post natal weight gain were significantly decreased 
Moreover  foetal resorption and skeletal malformations were increased  signifying potential toxicity of Chinese herbal medicines 
This is comparable to our findings To conclude  the results of this developmental toxicity study suggest that administration of SSD  and SSD  to pregnant rats exerted significant impact on intrauterine foetal growth and development without any effect on sex ratio when administered during the period of organogenesis 
The prenatal exposure of SSD  and SSD  at dosage level of   mg kg day and   mg kg day during gestational days  –  to female rats had demonstrable effect on maternal or embryo foetal toxicity and teratogenicity SBN and AG conceptualized the study  AS and DD developed the study protocol and conducted the experiment  analysed the data and interpreted the findings

It is therefore natural to expect that the distribution of amino acids  across all protein sequences  would appear to be fixed  given no mutations over a specific period of time 
Of the   naturally occurring amino acids  each seems to appear randomly located at a particular position within the sequence of a protein 
However  when the sequences of a group of proteins are compared to one another  specific patterns begin to emerge 
These patterns are commonly referred to as motifs and frequently produce similar structural elements and in many cases  similar functions between the proteins that contain them 
In recent years  significant efforts have been made to reduce sequences into discrete motifs  so that each can be linked to some specific biological function based on particular rules      
Databases that consist of identifiable amino acid motifs  such as PROSITE  Pratt and EMOTIF  have been constructed to allow researchers an easy classification of unknown proteins into families based on their common motifs               
All of these methods share one property  they depend on specific alignment algorithms  such as the basic local alignment search tool  BLAST or PSI BLAST  to perform the sequence comparison between diverse families of proteins being analyzed      
These methods have already led to a number of key discoveries and offer the promise of determining biologically meaningful information about function from a protein s primary sequence It is generally accepted that a strong correlation exists between a protein s amino acid sequence and its resulting structure and function         
Techniques that can quickly determine significant similarities between protein sequences are valuable in predicting an unknown protein s function within the cell 
Here we describe a procedure that  by computing the frequency of key amino acid pairs  can quickly classify large groups of proteins into functional groups 
In order to uncover any relevant amino acid strings  we have utilized statistical methods applicable to datasets with large fluctuations in the search of human protein sequences within both the Swiss Prot and Complete Human Genebank databases The goal of this manuscript is to demonstrate how these two residue motifs can be used to develop rapid methods for searching protein or genomic databases in order to locate potentially interesting or aberrant protein sequences 
As an example  we describe the distribution of select amino acid pairs within the genome of the Coronavirus  Tor  which is responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome  SARS    
We have examined additional sets  but the limited format of this paper precludes a large presentation of potential applications The set of all   naturally occurring  amino acids are described by their standard single letter representations  and are taken as the complete set contained within all protein sequences as shown below Zq A R N D C Q E G H I L K M F P S T W Y V Residues that are arranged in a certain order can be referred to as vectors and are represented symbolically as b n b b bn bj Zq The coordinates of each vector represent the amino acid symbols contained within any given protein  where n is the total length of the vector 
The collection of all vectors b n  in the proteome can therefore be denoted simply by Zq n The underlying structure of a protein sequence  which is the order of the amino acids  has unique and identifiable characteristics 
As an analogy  in written English  the letter q is almost always followed by u 
Also  the frequency of the word  and  is much higher than that of the related three letter strings   nad   nda   dan  and  dna  which are simply permutations of the same set of individual letters to construct a word with a different meaning 
Utilizing similar characteristics  we can intuitively scan for unique sequence vectors contained within any given protein 
We expand on these characteristics  by utilizing the concepts of affinity and order stability in Section  Using the entire Swiss Prot database  release number   as the basis for our calculations  we have constructed a probability table for the occurrence of the   naturally occurring amino acids  see Table  
    
In addition to the Swiss Prot database  we have also included data from Complete Human Genebank  NCBI Build Number   March    as a source for all characterized and hypothetical human protein sequences We use the symbol Ω to denote the Swiss Prot database  and the letter M to denote the number of proteins in the database  
Hence we can state that Ω As s M  where As a a as Ns  is the sth protein  ai with i Zq is the ith amino acid in the sequence  and Ns is the length of the protein sequence As 
For any vector b n  if there is a sequence As in Ω such that b n  is a segment of As  then we can say b n  occurs in Ω 
We can then use NΩ b n  to denote the total number of outcomes that b n  has occurred in Ω  and let NΩ n  be the total number of all vectors occurring in Ω with length n  Therefore p b n NΩ b n NΩ n is the probability that the vector b n  occurs in Ω 
We then introduce k p q b n log p b n q b n where p b n  and q b n  are any two probability distributions on Zq n  and b n  belongs to Zq n 
The quantity k p q b n  in Eq 
  is defined for any two probability distributions p b n  and q b n  on Zq n  where the distribution q arises from independent letter  i e  amino acid  probabilities 
Then  k p q b n  can be viewed as a random variable about b n  and its probability distribution is defined as follows F p q x PI k p q b n ⩽x b n k p q b n ⩽xp b n The expectation value μ p q  and variance σ p q  of p b n  are expressed mathematically as μ p q b n Zq n p b n k p q b n 
 σ p q b n Zq n p b n k p q b n μ p q  Hence we see that μ p q  is simply the Kullback–Leibler entropy   
As a consequence  μ p q  is always non negative and μ p q  if and only if p b n q b n 
As a result  the amino acid sequence of b n  can be represented by k p q b n In Eq 
  the probability distributions p  q in the k p q b n  have several possible values 
For example  if we let p be the probability of b n  and only change the value of q in k p q b n  we obtain the following expression q b n j np bj p b p b p bn Based on Eqs 
  and   the value of k p q b n  gives us the affinity for all amino acids within vector b n 
Here two situations are identified as especially interesting i When k p q b n  implies that among the amino acids in vector b n  there is an increased affinity 
That is  the vector b n  occurs more frequently than expected 
 ii When k p q b n  implies that among the amino acids in vector b n  there is a decreased affinity 
That is  the vector b n  occurs less frequently than expected In a similar approach to the condition described above  we may choose q b n p πn b n  where πn b n  is a permutation of b n  and πn denotes a permutation transform 
In this case  the order sensitivity of b n  can also be reflected by the value of k p q b n  and produces the following outcomes i when k p q b n  implies that b n  occurs much more often than πn b n ii when k p q b n  implies that πn b n  occurs much more often than b n In addition to the concepts of affinity and order sensitivity  we can also design other analysis techniques by choosing alternate representations of q b n 
Quantifying the terms k p q b n  we can represent vector frequency numerically 
In cases where k p q b n μ p q ⩾ σ p q  the corresponding vector b n  is called  positive  while in those cases where the opposite takes place  k p q b n μ p q ⩽ σ p q  the vector b n  is called  negative 
By judiciously choosing a   equal to   we obtained   two residue  positive pairs  and   two residue negative pairs  see Table  
  out of a total of   possibilities of amino acid pairs Using any one of the positive motifs from Table   we can develop a test method to detect changes in their distribution through any protein database 
If b b b  is  positive  then p b b μ σp b p b  where p ⋅  is the probability of the amino acids or vectors ⋅ in the database 
Since NΩ μ M Nμ p bj NΩ bj μ MNμ we have NΩ b μ M Nμ μ MNμ μ σp b NΩ b or NΩ b μ M Nμ μ MNμ μ σp b NΩ b and since μ M Nμ is very close to μ MNμfor Swiss Prot database we have NΩ b μ σp b NΩ b and NΩ b μ σp b NΩ b As a consequence of Eq 
  the detection of a deleterious mutation based on the increased appearance of an arbitrary string of these residues becomes possible 
For example  according to Table   CC is an attractive motif with   then NΩ CC μ σp C μ M Nμ μ MNμNΩ C ≈ μ σp C NΩ C Let Ns CC  and Ns C  be the number of CC and the number of C in the sth protein 
Then we have NΩ CC NΩ C  because μ σ  and p C  since NΩ CC s MNs CC NΩ C s MNs C Based upon the result that the CC pair represents a rare event  proteins satisfying Ns CC Ns C  as defined in Eq 
  suddenly become interesting 
We can therefore consider the number Ns CC  as an index to develop detection methods to test for the presence of a CC containing protein within a database 
Using this same reasoning  one can also use any other one of the remaining motifs in Table   to develop detection methods for additional proteins In an identical fashion to the previous example using the positive two residue motifs in Table   we can also use any of the  negative  two residue motifs to develop search methods 
For example  the CM pair is a  negative  two residue  word  with  
That is  p CM μ σp C p M 
Using identical arguments to those described in Section   we obtain NΩ CM NΩ M  and NΩ CM NΩ C 
Since both Ns M  and Ns C  are small numbers for fixed proteins  the overall number of CM pairs in most proteins should be close to zero 
Therefore  we can also use any of the remaining seven  negative  motifs in Table   to develop additional detection methods In contrast to the CC motif  the total number of proteins in the Swiss Prot database having more than one CM pair is quite small 
For example  among the   proteins contained within this database  the number of proteins such that Ns CM ⩾  is   and the number of proteins satisfying the condition Ns CM ⩾  is only  
For human proteins in Swiss Prot  the total number of proteins containing CM pairs is   and there are only   proteins that satisfy Ns CM ⩾   Table  
However  we would expect to find about   proteins having CM pairs in the Swiss Prot database  based upon the amino acid frequencies given in Table   which is greater than the number observed Cysteine rich proteins and the presence of CC pairs in proteins are both concepts that have been studied previously      
If we combine these two concepts and describe them in mathematical terms  we observe that the rates q Ns C Ns and q Ns CC Ns C  describe these two conditions  where Ns  Ns C  and Ns CC  are the numbers of all amino acids  cysteine  and CC  respectively 
We can then derive proteinsNs C Ns p C σ Ns CC Ns C p ξτ C ξτ C σ where σ  and σ  are the standard deviations about Ns C Nss Mand Ns CC Ns C s M respectively We have found the following computational results based on Swiss Prot database σ ≈ σ ≈ andp ξτ C ξτ C ⩾ p C For   we have a much simpler method to determine that a protein sequence is both C  and CC rich if proteinsNs C Ns ∩proteinsNs CC Ns C So  a much simpler method to test whether a protein is a both C  and CC rich for   isNumber of CC  Number of C Number of C  Length of protein Using this principle  we found a total of eight proteins that are both C  and CC rich within the Swiss Prot database For   there is an easier method to determine whether a protein sequence is both C  and CC rich if proteinsNs C Ns ∩proteinsNs CC Ns C So  a much simpler method to test whether a protein is both C  and CC rich for   is based on the inequalitiesNumber of CC  Number of C Number of C  Length of protein Using this principle  we can get a total of   proteins that are both C  and CC rich within the entire Swiss Prot database For   there is also an easier method to determine if a protein sequence is both C  and CC rich sequence when proteinsNs C Ns ∩proteinsNs CC Ns C So  a much simpler method to test whether a protein is both C  and CC rich for   is based on the inequalitiesNumber of CC  Number of C Number of C Length of protein Using this principle  we have identified a total of   proteins that are both C  and CC rich within the Swiss Prot database 
From these results  it becomes clear that there are many C rich proteins and many CC rich proteins that are not mutually inclusive 
The sets of both C  and CC rich proteins are only subsets of the set containing all C rich proteins or that containing all CC rich proteins Because the Swiss Prot database is somewhat biased to those proteins that are of interest to researchers  we have decided to examine a database that was  in essence  complete 
For this  we chose the human subset sequences contained within the Complete Human Genebank database 
This was the most complete and readily available source of human genetic sequences and should therefore provide us with an accurate representation of both CC and CM pair distributions 
We observed that the total number of CC pairs within the human subset of sequences contained in Genebank  a total of   proteins  was  
These pairs were contained within a total of   proteins  Table   a number that is substantially larger than the   we obtained from Swiss Prot data  Table  
Since the total number of amino acids in The Complete Human Genebank is   we can easily get the expected number of CC in Complete Human Genebank is   which is much less than this actual value  
The same also holds true for the CM pair  where we would expect to see   CM pairs  but actually observe    Table  
 
This result is surprising but true and shows that there are fundamental difference between the Human and other species in terms of the frequency of CC and CM pairs To create a single CM pair  it is obvious that one needs only a single C  If a protein sequence also contains a CC pair  the total number of cysteines available to create a CM pair has been reduced by a factor of  
Using the cutoff value of four CC pairs as statistically significant  we determined the probability of finding a CM pair within proteins that already contained a CC pair  Table  
Even though both CC and CM can occur in the same protein  the total number of proteins in Genebank that contain both CC and CM pairs is   and these pairs almost always occur at different locations in the sequence 
However  in some rare cases the second C within the CC pair is shared with the first C within the CM pair  giving us a new triplet CCM If we filter the set of proteins described above for redundant entries  we obtain a set of   unique proteins that contain the CCM triplet in the human proteome 
Using the probability distributions obtained from Swiss Prot  we obtained the probability of CCM as  
Since the total of all protein lengths in the Swiss Prot database is   there should be a total of   CCM triplets 
This value is almost identical to the predicted number of CCM of  
This result suggests that the CCM triplet at least in Swiss Prot occurs randomly 
However  we can also analyze the CCM probability using a different approach  putting q CCM p CC p M  into Eq 
 
If CCM occurs randomly  then we have p CCM p C p C p M  and since p CC μ σp C p C  we will get k p q CCM log p CCM q CCM log p C p CC ⩽ μ σ Based on Eq 
  it is clear that the presence of a CC pair strongly excludes M  Therefore  the probability of the CCM triplet should occur less frequently than that of CC or M individually We have obtained the following statistical results with regard to the total number of CC and CM pairs contained in the Swiss Prot database i The total number of these proteins satisfying Ns CC ⩾  is   and   of these are found in humans 
 ii The total number of human proteins in Ω that satisfy Ns CC ⩾  is  
 iii The total number of the proteins in Ω that satisfy Ns CM ⩾  is     of these are found in humans 
 iv The total number of human proteins in Ω that satisfy Ns CM ⩾  is only  
The genome of the SARS associated Coronavirus contains a total of   open reading frames  which code for six characterized and five uncharacterized proteins   
After examining the complete proteome the SARS associated Coronavirus we observed a statistically significant increase in the occurrence of the CC and CM pairs in the SARS associated Coronavirus  genome Of the   putative proteins  four contain either CC or CM pairs 
Two large poly proteins  GI  and GI  contain   CC and   CM pairs  as well as   CC and   CM pairs  respectively 
The putative spike glycoprotein  GI    contains   CC and   CM  while the small envelope protein  GI    contains only   CC pair 
The remaining   proteins  of which two have been identified as a nucleocapsid and matrix protein  contain no CC or CM pairs 
When compared to the occurrence of CC and CM pairs within all human proteins found in the Swiss Prot database  it becomes clear that there is an increased occurrence of these pairs within the SARS associated Coronavirus proteome It is clear that the frequency of CC and CM pairs is significantly higher in the SARS genome than it is in the human genome 
It is our hope that these unique two residue motifs could be used as a means of identifying a virus such as SARS 
While currently impossible to determine  one can see a possible clinical use for determining the frequency of CC or CM pairs in an individual 
If a person has been infected by SARS  we would expect the numbers of CC and CM pairs to be much higher than in a healthy individual 
If we were then able to develop a clinically feasible technique that could identify the CC or CM pair content in total cellular protein  without damaging the cell  it could be possible to implement a detection method simply by counting the numbers of CC or CM pairs in all proteins examined 
If the presence of increased CC or CM pairs was indicative of infection by SARS we could develop new drugs to inhibit the translation of proteins that contain these pairs within infected cells 
As a very specific example  this could be accomplished through the use of specific tRNA mimics that could block translating ribosome when these pairs appear at the P and A site simultaneously      
While tRNA mimics could normally be seen as non specific protein synthesis inhibitors  the lower frequency of the CC or CM motifs in host proteins as compared to the relatively high occurrence in viral protein provide a starting point for the analysis of treatments using methods such as these In this paper we have performed a detailed search of the Swiss Prot and Complete Human Genebank database in relation to the frequencies of each of the   natural amino acids and motifs made up of two residues 
This has provided us with a new insight into the distribution of proteins within these databases and the information that may be contained within a protein s primary amino acid sequence 
Our focus in this quest has been to examine specific pairs or triplets of residues and use probability theory to assess whether or not particular strings of residues occur more frequently than their probability would indicate 
By analyzing affinity and anti affinity  we developed a procedure to search out all two  and three residue clusters within these databases 
Through this technique  we can rapidly classify large groups of proteins into families based on the occurrence of these motifs 
Combining this concept with a specific knowledge of protein function  we propose novel ideas aimed at developing fast detection methods for specific diseases based on the unusually high occurrence of some of these motifs when compared with the expected probabilities 
A timely example of the application of this method is given  namely the analysis of the SARS virus 
This method will hopefully lead to the discovery of new diagnostic techniques and possible treatment of diseases  by recognizing the location of target domains in the expressed sequence Cell type specific expression of the putative SARS CoV  receptor ACE  in human heartsThe coronavirus disease    COVID  caused by SARS CoV  infections imposes a major threat for the world s healthcare systems and is leading to thousands of deaths 
Angiotensin converting enzyme    ACE  has been identified as a potential receptor for SARS coronavirus  and is also considered the main receptor for SARS CoV  SARS CoV  binds to ACE  via its glycosylated outer membrane spike proteins 
ACE  is highly expressed in the lung and heart  and is known for its vital role in the cardiovascular system –  Although SARS CoV  mainly invades alveolar epithelial cells  it can also cause myocardial injury  as assessed by increased troponin T and NT proBNP levels accompanying increased cardiovascular symptoms in COVID infected patients  It is unclear whether elevated biomarkers of cardiac injury  or long term effects on the cardiovascular system  are directly caused by viral infection of cardiac tissue or are secondary to hypoxia and systemic inflammation 
However  patients with underlying cardiovascular disease represent a significant proportion of the patients who may suffer from a severe course after COVID  infection  This situation may be aggravated by findings showing that ACE inhibitors  which are often used to treat cardiovascular diseases  augment the expression of the SARS CoV  receptor ACE  in lung cells  This is probably mediated by an effect on angiotensin II  which is known to reduce ACE  expression  Thus  ACE inhibition decreases angiotensin II  leading to an indirect up regulation of ACE  The effect of angiotensin II receptor blockers  ARBs  which primarily target the angiotensin receptor   is unclear 
One may speculate that ARBs indirectly reduce ACE  levels by augmenting free angiotensin II levels  which in turn is expected to down regulate ACE  via activating the angiotensin receptor  
However  the effect of the two different treatments on the expression of ACE  in the heart requires further investigation Therefore  we used single nuclei RNA sequencing to determine the expression of ACE and ACE  in the different cell types of the human heart 
Gene expression signatures were detected in cardiac tissues of five patients with aortic stenosis  AS  and two patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction  HFrEF   Figure  A  and compared with with samples of one healthy donor heart  age    years  male  that was not used for transplantation 
After single nuclei RNA sequencing  data were pooled  and unsupervised clustering was performed with a total of     nuclei 
We found   distinct clusters 
Using cell type specific gene markers  major cell types were annotated  including cardiomyocytes  six clusters  fibroblasts  one cluster  endothelial cells  three clusters  leucocytes  two clusters  pericytes  one cluster  and smooth muscle cells  one cluster   Figure  B–D 
ACE  was expressed in cardiomyocytes  Cluster   and   and mural cells  particularly pericytes  Cluster   and was detected at a lower expression level in fibroblasts  endothelial cell  and leucocytes  Figure  D 
Comparison of ACE  in a pooled analysis of nuclei of the different groups showed that ACE  was significantly elevated in cardiomyocytes of patients with heart disease compared with healthy controls  Figure  E 
ACE  was also slightly  but not significantly  increased in endothelial cells  and the expression was lower in fibroblasts of patients with heart disease compared with healthy controls  Figure  E 
Immunostaining confirmed an increased expression of ACE  in cardiomyocytes of patients with aortic stenosis  Figure  F 
In addition  ACE was augmented in cardiomyocytes of patients with AS and HFrEF  Figure  G 
Interestingly  cardiomyocytes of patients who were treated with ACE inhibitors showed a significantly higher ACE  expression compared with ARB treated patients  Figure  H 
Moreover  patients treated with ACE inhibitors had an imbalance of ACE to ACE  expression  with a more than four fold higher ACE ACE  ratio compared with healthy control cells  Figure  I In conclusion  these data provide novel insights into the cell type specific expression and regulation of ACE  in the heart 
Patients with varying heart disease aetiology show augmented expression of ACE  levels particularly in cardiomyocytes 
Treatment with ACE inhibitors tends to be associated with increased ACE  mRNA and unfavourable ACE ACE  ratios  which are believed to be a driver of cardiovascular pathologies  This study is limited by its small sample size and therefore is only hypothesis generating 
However  these novel data suggest that it will be important to monitor SARS CoV infected patients for cardiovascular complications and assess the impact of ARB ACE inhibitor therapy 
Conflict of interest  none declared New onset acute symptomatic seizure and risk factors in coronavirus disease   A retrospective multicenter studyIn December   pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus  later called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus    SARS‐CoV‐  was first reported in Wuhan  China 
On March     the World Health Organization  WHO  declared the syndrome caused by SARS‐CoV‐  infection  coronavirus disease    COVID‐  a pandemic 
According to a WHO Situation Report of April    
 
 there are   confirmed COVID‐  cases and   deaths globally 
COVID‐  affects people of all ages 
 
  
 
 and in severe cases  it may cause dyspnea  hypoxia  acute respiratory distress syndrome  and septic shock 
 
  
 

The current situation has raised concerns regarding whether people with epilepsy have a higher risk to be infected with COVID‐  and whether people would develop acute seizures during the course of COVID‐ 
The objective of this study is to clarify the incidence and the risk of acute symptomatic seizures during acute COVID‐  infections This retrospective multicenter study was approved by the ethics committee of West China Hospital  Sichuan University  approval   
The study was conducted in   officially designed hospitals in Hubei province  the epicenter of the COVID‐  epidemic in China  Sichuan province  and Chongqing municipality 
These hospitals included the East Branch of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University  West China Ward  Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital  and hospitals in Sichuan province designated by the government to treat COVID‐   see the list of hospitals in Appendix S People with COVID‐  who were discharged from or died in the participating hospitals between January   and February     were consecutively enrolled 
All cases were diagnosed according to the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for COVID‐   trial version  
 
 All those enrolled tested positive through nucleic acid detection 
Disease severity was classified as mild  moderate  severe  or critical according to the national guidelines  see Box   for classification criteria 
 
 For our study  we aggregated severe and critical cases into a single severe group  whereas mild and moderate cases were aggregated into a single milder group 
The clinical outcome at discharge was either cured or death Electronic medical records of all enrolled cases were reviewed by   neurologists using a standard case report form  Appendix S 
Data were extracted on demographic characteristics  medical history  complications  treatments  and presence of risk factors for seizures 
These risk factors were considered to be the following  acute cerebrovascular disease  traumatic brain injury  TBI  central nervous system  CNS  infection  shock  hypoxia  severe metabolic disturbance  based on criteria from the International League Against Epilepsy
 
  multiple‐organ dysfunction syndrome  sepsis  and exposure to drugs or toxic substances Continuous variables were presented as median  interquartile range  and categorical variables as n  All of   people discharged from or who died at participating hospitals were consecutively identified and enrolled 
Most were from Sichuan province  n     followed by Chongqing  n     and Hubei  n    Ten individuals died  giving case fatality rates of    n     in Hubei     n     in Chongqing  and    n     in Sichuan 
Of the   severe cases      received mechanical ventilation  and     were given sedatives 
Apart from the effect of sedatives  mental state was relatively normal in   people 
Eight were encephalopathic  one was obtunded  one was delirious  and six were comatose 
The diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus was not made in any of these cases based on clinical presentation  results of investigations  or response to therapy 
No routine or long‐term electroencephalogram  EEG  was recorded due to exposure concerns None in this cohort had a past history of epilepsy 
None had any seizures  including febrile seizures  or status epilepticus during hospitalization 
Seizurelike events were seen in two people  it was believed that this was the result of an acute stress reaction in one and hypocalcemia in the other The first was a  ‐year‐old woman who reported bilateral bodily spasms lasting for about   minute  with mouth deviation but no impairment of awareness 
She was evaluated neurologically and psychiatrically and was diagnosed with an acute anxiety disorder  which was treated with olanzapine  paroxetine  and diazepam The second case was a  ‐year‐old woman who displayed bilateral myoclonus in the limbs with no impairment in consciousness   hours after admission 
Although this was initially suspected to represent seizures  she was found to have an electrolyte disturbance including hyponatremia  hypokalemia  and hypocalcemia  and the myoclonus resolved with correction of the metabolic disturbances Eighty‐four   cases reported systemic or direct brain insults that increased their risk for acute symptomatic seizures  Table  
The most common risk factor was hypoxia 
No severe electrolyte disturbance was seen  but hypokalemia  n       hyponatremia  n       and hypocalcemia  n       were frequently seen in the cohort 
Urea  creatinine  and serum glucose levels were moderately altered in most of cases 
In two cases who had chronic kidney dysfunction  substantial increases in creatinine levels were noted 
Results of investigations are shown in Table  
One case with TBI had an epidural hematoma  cerebral contusion  and skull base fracture 
Five people with severe COVID‐  experienced septic shock 
Three other cases of shock had hypovolemia or cardiac problems 
Ninety‐four   were given antibiotics  moxifloxacin  n       piperacillin sulbactam sodium  n       and third‐generation cephalosporins  n       were most commonly used We found no new onset seizures or status epilepticus in a large cohort of people hospitalized during the acute phase of COVID   infection despite a substantial proportion having risk factors for acute symptomatic seizures 
This is useful information  given the prior lack of knowledge about seizure risk during the acute phase of infection No individual in this cohort had a history of epilepsy prior to hospital admission 
To date  there is not much information available on people with epilepsy during the COVID‐  crisis 
There is one report of epilepsy in a case COVID‐  from Wuhan 
 
 As information is limited  it is not possible to establish whether this was a patient who had a history of epilepsy or whether the patient presented acute seizures 
There is at this time little if any evidence indicating that people with epilepsy are at an increased risk of COVID‐  infection 
A major challenge for people with epilepsy in this outbreak is nonadherence with the prescribed antiseizure medication  which was seen during the in SARS endemic in  
 
 This indicates the need to ensure the availability of supplies of medications and to advocate patients  self‐management 
Possible strategies for coping could also include online consultations and telemedicine networks Although many neurological and systemic disorders regarded as potential triggers
 
 of acute symptomatic seizures were identified in this cohort  seizures and status were not seen 
Stroke is one such risk factor 
The risk of developing acute symptomatic seizures after stroke ranges from   to  
 
 Acute cerebrovascular disease is considered a major cause of seizure and status epilepticus 
An earlier study from Hubei
 
  
 
 also reported six people with COVID‐  who had acute cerebrovascular disease without seizure 
Infection of the CNS can also give rise to seizures 
Although there is limited evidence of the presence of the SARS‐CoV‐  in the cerebrospinal fluid  CSF  the co‐occurrence of tubercular meningitis
 
 had been reported  with no seizure or status observed 
To determine whether COVID‐  can cause direct CNS insults requires further follow‐up 
In the earlier outbreaks of another coronavirus  a generalized convulsion with a positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for SARS‐CoV in CSF was reported  which could have been a coincidence 
 

Disturbances of homeostasis may lead to acute symptomatic seizures 
Hypoxia  the most common complication in our cohort  may trigger anoxic encephalopathy  particularly in refractory hypoxia 
Electrolyte disturbances as seen in COVID‐  are considered to be potential causes of acute symptomatic seizure 
 
 The severity and speed of such disturbances may affect onset of seizures  so these parameters should be carefully monitored The cytokine storm syndromes
 
 behind severe infection may cause the production of inflammatory cytokines systemically  with the consequence of acute toxic encephalopathies 
Although sepsis is a common cause of encephalopathy in intensive care medicine 
 
 hypoxia appears far more often than sepsis in COVID‐ 
There was also a high rate of septic shock in the COVID‐  population  varying from  
 
 to   in earlier studies in Hubei 
 
  
 

Certain antibiotics have been associated with symptomatic seizure 
 
 Antibiotics were used in a large number of people in our cohort without problems  but the most used antibiotics in the cohort were of low or moderate risk 
Clinicians should keep this seizure risk in mind when prescribing antibiotics  especially for people with renal dysfunction 
 

Our study has several limitations 
First  as a cross‐sectional study  we only have data from the acute phase of the disease 
A follow‐up study is underway to evaluate longitudinal seizure outcomes 
Second  the retrospective study design meant that we could not collect data on all relevant variables  for example  EEG was not recorded  so subclinical seizures could have been missed 
As all health care costs of COVID‐  treatment are covered by the government  all those suspected of infection are screened 
This may assure the objectivity and reliability of study materials  and it will allow for a future follow‐up study Our analysis suggests that COVID‐  poses minimal risk for seizures during the acute illness  although a significant proportion of severely ill individuals have risk factors that may increase the propensity to experience seizures 
These risk factors should be promptly addressed to minimize the risk of developing seizures 
Prospective long‐term studies must be done to determine whether people who have suffered from COVID‐  have an increased risk for developing seizures or epilepsy in subsequent months or years as a consequence of their illness None of the authors has any conflict of interest to disclose 
We confirm that we have read the Journal s position on issues involved in ethical publication and affirm that this report is consistent with those guidelines Decreased prealbumin level is associated with increased risk of mortality in hospitalized elderly patients with COVID The coronavirus disease    COVID  epidemic is caused by an infection with a novel coronavirus  officially named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus    SARS COV 
The infection spread rapidly on all continents and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization 
As of April       documented cases were reported worldwide  and   patients had died 
As there are currently no specific treatments and medications against the new virus  it is crucial to identify risk factors of severe prognosis Older patients have poorer prognostic factors and are more likely to experience critical disease 
 
 
Based on recent statistical data of China  among patients who were   years and older  the mortality rate was   which was significantly higher than that of younger patients at  
The proportion of deaths over   years old accounts for   of the total deaths in the national wide  which implicates aged people are more vulnerable to the SARS CoV 
Till present there are rare reports in literature focusing on the risk factors for poor outcomes of the elderly patients with COVID Serum prealbumin  known as transthyretin  its levels may be lowered not only by malnutrition  but also by inflammation and aging 
 
 
Compared to albumin  prealbumin has a shorter half life  a more rapid rate of hepatic synthesis  and predictable catabolic rate  hence  it may be a more sensitive indicator 
However  whether prealbumin could be an independent predictor of mortality in hospitalized COVID  elderly patients needs to be further elucidated The present study aims to describe the clinical characteristics and to investigate whether the prealbumin can serve as a valuable predictor of in hospital mortality  which might provide evidence for the risk stratification in elderly and help to improve the clinical practice and reduce fatality We designed this study as a retrospective cohort study design 
The elderly patients with COVID  who were admitted to Tongji Hospital in Wuhan from January   to February     were consecutively included 
This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Tongji Hospital  Approval Number  TJ IRB  and was complied with the Declaration of Helsinki 
The data were anonymous and the study was observational  so the informed consent was not gathered 
A flow diagram illustrating patient selection was described in Figure  
 
Inclusion criteria included elderly patients  ≥   years old  diagnosed with COVID  infection 
A total of   participants have been obtained 
Patients having missing baseline or outcome data  died on admission or being transferred to other designated hospitals during hospitalization were excluded 
There were   patients were included in the final analyses Data collection of participants was performed using hospital electronic medical record system 
Information included medical history  demographic data  physical examination  and hematological  biochemical  radiological and microbiological evaluation results were reviewed 
The data collection forms were reviewed independently by   researchers  CL and LYY 
Blood examinations were assessed at the central laboratory of Tongji Hospital following standard operative procedures 
The routine blood test was analyzed using Sysmex XE  hematology analyzer  Sysmex  Kobe  Japan 
The Cobas C   Roche  Mannheim  Germany  was used to measure the biochemical parameters 
Coagulation tests were detected by STA R MAX coagulation analyzer  Diagnostica Stago  Saint Denis  France 
Throat swab samples were collected and were tested for SARS CoV  with commercial real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  RT PCR  kit from DAAN GENE  Guangzhou  China 
The diagnostic criteria and all clinical procedures in this study followed  Diagnosis and Treatment of Pneumonia Caused by New Coronavirus  Trial version   to   promulgated by the National Health and Health Commission of China Summary statistics of baseline characteristics of all patients and stratification by prealbumin tertiles were expressed as frequency and proportion for categorical variables  mean   standard deviation  SD   Gaussian distribution  or median  range   Skewed distribution  for continuous variables  and as percentages for categorical variables 
The differences between groups were analyzed using the χ   categorical variables  One Way ANOVA test  normal distribution  or Kruskal Whallis H test  skewed distribution We examined the relationship of the prealbumin as categorized into tertiles with the outcomes of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation 
Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to evaluate these relationships  then unadjusted and adjusted odds ratio  ORs  and   confidence intervals  CIs  were calculated 
Model   is the minimally adjusted model with only sociodemographic variables adjusted 
Model   is the fully adjusted model with covariates including age  sex  smoking status  history of hypertension  history of coronary heart disease  history of diabetes  history of chronic kidney disease  history of carcinoma  history of chronic liver disease  neutrophil  lymphocyte  prothrombin time  activated partial thromboplastin time  d dimer  alanine transaminase  aspartate aminotransferase  total bilirubin  blood urea nitrogen  creatinine  C reactive protein and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio 
We calculated odds ratio  ORs  and   confidence intervals  CIs 
The highest tertile was the reference for prealbumin 
We performed test for linear trend by entering the median value of each category of prealbumin tertile as continuous variable to examine the possibility of nonlinearity To ensure the robustness of our results  we also performed stratified analyses with the prealbumin as a continuous variable for the overall population and stratified by gender  age  hypertension status and coronary heart disease status at baseline 
Generalized additive models were used to visually confirm the relationship between prealbumin as continuous variable and the risk of outcomes  all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation Modeling was performed with the statistical software packages R  http www R project org  The R Foundation  and EmpowerStats  http www empowerstats com  X Y Solutions  Inc  Boston  MA 
P values less than    two sided  were considered statistically significant In our study    cases were excluded 
To avoid selection bias due to missing data  we performed a sensitivity analysis 
The results showed that there was no statistical difference between missing group and non missing group  supplemental table  Of   elderly inpatients included in the final analysis  the mean age was     years  ranging from   years to   years  and most patients were male  table  
 
The baseline characteristics of these included participants were listed in table 
The day of sample drawing after admission was       day 
No significant statistical difference in sex  smoking status  body weight  BMI  comorbidity  hypertension  coronary heart disease  chronic kidney disease  cerebral vascular disease  carcinoma  chronic liver disease  symptoms  fever  cough  headache  diarrhea and myalgia fatigue at admission  were detected across different groups of prealbumin  tertile 
When compared with subjects in the highest tertile  those in the lowest tertile were older  more likely to have diabetes medical history  with higher Neutrophil count  lower lymphocyte count  worse coagulation function and liver function 
A total of     patients required mechanical ventilation      patients admitted to intensive care unit and     patients died during hospitalization 
The incidence of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation were significantly decreased across prealbumin tertiles  all cause death    vs    vs    for tertile   vs  tertile   vs  tertile   ICU admission    vs    vs    for tertile   vs  tertile   vs  tertile   mechanical ventilation    vs    vs    for tertile   vs  tertile   vs  tertile   respectively To investigate the correlation between prealbumin and in hospital outcomes  we constructed three models using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models  table  
 
In the unadjusted model  the ORs of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation was significantly increased as the prealbumin tertiles downgraded 
The OR for tertile   was significantly higher than the OR for tertile    OR       CI    to   P   for all cause death  OR       CI    to   P   for ICU admission  OR       CI    to   P   for mechanical ventilation 
Additional adjustment for the demographic variables and comorbidities did not reduce the ORs for the association between prealbumin tertiles and in hospital outcomes 
Further adjusting for the baseline levels of blood examinations  including blood routine  neutrophil  lymphocyte  neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio  coagulation function  prothrombin time  activated partial thromboplastin time  d dimer  liver fuction  alanine transaminase  aspartate aminotransferase  total bilirubin  renal function  blood urea nitrogen  creatinine  and infection indicators  C reactive protein  did not affect the relationships in the fully adjusted models  OR       CI    to   P   for all cause death  OR       CI    to   P   for ICU admission  OR       CI    to   P     for mechanical ventilation 
Therefore  lower tertile of prealbumin exhibited an increased risk of worse in hospital outcomes  full adjusted P for trend for all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation  P     P   and P     respectively Generalized additive models  Fig  
A through  C  were used to visually assess functional relationships between the prealbumin as continuous variate and the risk of in hospital outcomes 
Serum prealbumin was found to have negative linear relationship with the risk of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation To determine the consistency of the relationship between baseline prealbumin as a continuous variable and in hospital outcomes  we conducted stratified analyses  Table  
 
For each unit increase of prealbumin  the adjusted OR for all cause death was   in males  P     and   in females  P    
The adjusted OR for all cause death for persons less than   years of age was    P     compared with    p     for persons   years and older  P interaction    
For each unit increase of the prealbumin  the OR for all cause death was    P     and    P     for normotensives and hypertensives     P     and    P     for non diabetic and diabetes respectively 
The difference of interaction was not significant between two groups  P interaction         and   stratified for gender  age  hypertention and diabetes respectively 
Moreover  the relationship between baseline prealbumin with ICU admission and mechanical ventilation stratified by gender  age  hypertention and diabetes are consistent In this study  we found that lower serum prealbumin significantly associated with an increased risk of worse outcomes and all cause death during hospitalization 
Patients in the lowest tertile of prealbumin were older  and with higher Neutrophil count  lower lymphocyte count  worse coagulation function and liver function compared with subjects in the highest tertile 
Then we adjusted relevant covariates including age  sex  smoking status  comorbidities  neutrophil  lymphocyte  coagulation function  liver function  renal function and C reactive protein to minimize the potential impact of confounding 
Compared with crude regression analyses  this association still persisted when adjusting for demographic and clinical variables in the multivariable regression analyses 
Moreover  stratified by gender  age  hypertension and diabetes  increased level of serum prealbumin was associated with the decreased risk of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation  which determine the consistency of the relationship between lowest serum prealbumin tertile and the increased risk of worse outcomes in elderly COVID  patients Several previous studies have demonstrated baseline prealbumin change in COVID  patients 
Decreased level of prealbumin was observed among COVID  patients 
Wu C et al investigated   patients with COVID  and observed that prealbumin was associated with the development of ARDS  indicating the potential value of prealbumin level on COVID  clinical ending 
Till date  no report exists on the effect of prealbumin in COVID  elderly patients High proportion of severe to critical cases and high fatality rate were observed in the elderlyCOVID  patients  and rapid disease progress was noted in the dead 
One possible explanation involves the greater potential of seniors to be in a state of inflammation  nutritional deficiency and other complications 
Prealbumin is a globular  non glycosilated protein  synthesized by the liver  and complexed with a retinol binding protein  which acts as a transporter of retinol vitamin A and thyroid hormones 
Low plasma prealbumin level has far back emerged as an earliest laboratory indicator of poor nutritional status 
 
 
In addition  prealbumin are also associated with inflammation 
Previous studies showed that in response to the inflammation  the body responds by synthesizing a large number of cytokines 
These include interleukins and tumor necrosis factors that down regulate  decrease  plasma concentrations of albumin and prealbumin 
 
 
Therefore  assay of serum prealbumin concentration is recommended by some investigators as a screening marker for both malnutrition and inflammation Elderly with low plasma prealbumin levels mean that those people are at greater risk of malnutrition and inflammatory conditions  which may lead to poor prognosis 
Malnutrition is commonly seen in hospitalized patients in both the developed and developing world  especially among elderly patients 
A review of   published studies of acute care patients reported that malnutrition incidence ranged from  –  of hospitalized elderly 
It was found that compared to non famine regions of India  experiencing famine had significantly higher influenza mortality rates during the   Influenza pandemic 
Aging  frailty  and chronic diseases are associated with impaired immune function and are compounded by immune dysregulation from malnutrition 
When immune response is dysregulated  it would result in an excessive inflammation  even death 
In the current COVID  study  it was found that elderly patients have higher levels of white blood cells counts  CRP  inflammatory cytokines and are more likely to experience critical disease than did those younger patients 
 
 This retrospective cohort study included   elderly COVID  patients  until the date of February       of patients required mechanical ventilation    of patients admitted to intensive care unit  and the total in hospital mortality was  
The mortality rate was lower than that reported by wang L et al  among elderly COVID  patients 
This may have been the reason for some patients at the date of February     are still in hospital 
Nevertheless  this would not bias the relationship between prealbumin and in hospital outcomes because of the definite observation time we set previously 
Moreover  Wuhan tongji Hospital as one of the largest third grade Class A hospitals equipped with advanced life support training and equipment may partly account for the moderate mortality The results of this study have several clinical implications and strengths 
A low prealbumin concentration can therefore be regarded primarily as a signal identifying the at risk elderly patient who would suffer worse outcomes and requires careful assessment and monitoring for whom nutritional support and Inflammation detection may be needed as part of the treatment plan 
As observational study was susceptible to various confounders  we adjusted many variables that may affect the relationship between prealbumin and in hospital outcomes to minimize potential confounding 
In addition  we tested the robustness of the results by repeating the analyses in different subgroups of gender  age  history of hypertension and history of diabetes Our study has some limitations 
First  by including patients still in hospital as of J February     the case fatality ratio in our study cannot reflect the true mortality of elderly COVID 
Second  the record of data may be affected by prehospital medication and the time interval between admission and onset 
Third  since all subjects in our study were hospitalized Chinese elderly patients diagnosed with COVID  results of this study might not directly be applied to other ethnicities and age groups In conclusion  this retrospective cohort study revealed that the prealbumin is an independent risk factor for the in hospital mortality in the Chinese COVID  elderly patients 
Nutritional support and Inflammation detection should be careful assessment and monitoring for the elderly patients with low prealbumin concentration

Coping With COVID  Emergency Stress  Secondary Trauma and Self Efficacy in Healthcare and Emergency Workers in ItalyThe coronavirus disease  COVID  or the acute respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus    SARS CoV  began spreading in China at the end of   and  to date  represents an international health emergency without precedents in terms of its health  economic  and organizational effects on people s lives  World Health Organization   
After China  Italy was the first country to be affected by this epidemic  with the first deaths on February     and a rapid increase in the spread of infection and mortality 
COVID  was first detected in Northern Italy  and it then spread  although at different rates of incidence  to the other regions 
It was immediately evident that healthcare and emergency workers were at great risk of contagion and that protection and intervention protocols needed to be introduced in the absence of adequate points of reference because of the exceptional nature of the epidemic  the rate of spread of the infection  the seriousness of patients  health condition  and the mortality index 
The extreme conditions in which health workers have had to work  especially in the most affected regions in Northern Italy  are indicated by the following data from the Italian National Institute of Health   over   doctors died and   other health workers were infected within the general context of the population of   deaths and   infections in a span of   weeks 
It was also clear that the medical staff would experience serious psychological repercussions because of the working conditions as well as the difficulty of having scientific points of reference on care and intervention procedures 
To this must be added the increase in workload  the extension of working hours and  for health workers  the frequent exposure to the suffering and death of their patients 
Therefore  healthcare and emergency workers were subjected to serious psychological as well as physical stress 
Hence  the aim of this study  which was also the aim of a previous study  Vagni et al    is to focus on the similarities and the differences in the stress management of two professional groups healthcare and emergency workers during the acute phase of the pandemic 
Both groups have had to deal with COVID patients as frontline responders and have been exposed to the related risks of infection and psychological consequences  which  to date  have not been examined in detail through a comparative analysis As regards the stress that they experience  the literature clearly explains that healthcare and emergency workers who intervene in emergency situations are exposed to the risk of developing dysfunctional reactions that can be identified at different levels physical and or physiological  e g  psychosomatic disorders  sleep wake cycle alterations  and sense of tiredness  emotional  e g  irritability  nervousness  agitation  anger  low self esteem  and guilt  cognitive  e g  distractibility  sense of ineffectiveness  and negative anticipation of events  and relational  e g  increase in conflicts within emergency teams and or with their organization institution  and social withdrawal and may also develop reactions from secondary trauma  Del Missier et al    Sbattella    Argentero and Setti    Fraccaroli and Balducci    Bellelli and Di Schiena    Walton et al   
Faced with stressful events regarding which they lack previous experience and specific  necessary knowledge  and which cause tension owing to the need for rapid decision timings and a sense of responsibility  emergency workers may experience a sense of decision ineffectiveness 
In fact  emergency situations are characterized by high levels of decisional and operational uncertainty with associated regret and guilt  Del Missier et al   Several studies have highlighted that insufficient instructions and a lack of personal protective equipment  PPE  are important predictors of stress for healthcare and emergency workers in large scale emergencies  Oh et al    Du et al    El Hage et al    Walton et al   
Oh et al 
  highlighted that nurses involved in managing the Middle East respiratory syndrome  MERS  experienced lower levels of stress when the levels of goods supply and hospital training were higher 
Some studies have highlighted that frontline healthcare workers had lower secondary traumatization scores than non frontline health workers and the general public in contrast to the findings of previous research on the SARS outbreak in the same area in Singapore  Chan and Huak   
According to Barleycorn   and Tan et al 
  these results may be due to the dedicated training and psychological support given to healthcare workers after the SARS outbreak and demonstrate the validity of policy strategies for prevention of stress in the psychological health field An analysis of   studies published from January to March   aimed at investigating the stress experience of healthcare workers in facing COVID  shows that health workers experienced symptoms of depression and anxiety related to this stressful experience 
Moreover  the severity of their symptoms was influenced by their age  gender  role  specialization  type of activity performed  and exposure to patients with COVID  however  prevention  resilience  and social support interventions mediated their response to stress  Bohlken et al   
In a review of the literature  Spoorthy   underlined that sociodemographic variables  such as age  gender  profession  and workplace  and psychological variables  such as poor social support and self efficacy  affect the stress level experienced by health workers 
In addition  COVID  emerged as an independent stress risk factor 
Xiao et al 
  found that social support plays a role in reducing the anxiety levels in medical staff and increases their sense of self efficacy According to Walton et al 
  the specific stressors that health workers face in the COVID  emergency are related to the organizational context 
The challenges for medical staff include not only an increased workload but also a fear of infection  the need to work with new protocols that change frequently  and the use of PPE 
In uncontrollable situations such as a pandemic  when specific action protocols are absent and limited resources are available  health workers must make individual decisions with a heavy burden of responsibility that may be contrary to their moral principles 
For example  in the case of COVID  they may have to choose which patients to save because only a few places are available in intensive care 
In this regard  Cai et al 
  showed that for a sample of   healthcare professionals who worked closely with COVID  patients in Hubei  the most stressful factors were the lack of protocols for the treatment of COVID  the scarcity of PPE  the exhausting work shifts  their concern about the risk of infection  and their exposure to the death and suffering of their patients 
They also found that the support of superiors proved to be one of the most important motivational factors for medical staff  and the presence of clear guidelines and effective safety protocols were protective factors against the development of stress  in particular  for females 
Further  Walton et al 
  identified the organizational stressors as the changes in work shifts  the prevalence of night shifts  an excessive workload  staff roles  autonomy  the lack of support from superiors  and the absence of adequate information and clear instructions 
On the basis of these stressors  they estimated that   of the medical staff working on the front line of this pandemic are at risk of developing post traumatic stress disorder  PTSD 
In addition  limited resources  longer shifts  decreased hours of rest  and the occupational risks associated with COVID  exposure have increased the physical and mental fatigue  stress  anxiety  and burnout of these staff members  Sasangohar et al   The loss of a social support network  which can be an important resilience factor  is another risk factor  Ozbay et al   
In the COVID  emergency  healthcare and emergency workers have often experienced a separation from their affective links  either because of the restrictions on social contacts imposed by the lockdown or the fear of spreading the infection to their family members 
To this must be added that although  at first  health workers received unanimous encouragement from the population  later  they also experienced demonstrations of stigma and isolation 
Some studies have shown that being able to resort to their own social support network is a significant protective factor for health workers dealing with this emergency  Cai et al   As Favretto   stated  when individuals experience situations that go beyond their coping strategies  their vulnerability to  and risk of developing  psychopathological reactions increases 
Studies conducted during previous epidemics  such as the SARS  MERS  and Ebola epidemics  converge in detecting how healthcare and emergency workers may experience extremely high levels of stress and even develop secondary traumatic stress or vicarious trauma 
This trauma is defined as an experience of symptoms similar to those found in people with PTSD  such as in emergency nurses working with traumatized patients  Beck   
Figley   defined it as a form of stress that derives from the feelings of empathy experienced when helping traumatized people 
The symptoms may include intrusive recurring thoughts  disturbed sleep  fatigue  physical symptoms  hyperarousal  increased stress response  anxiety  depression  and feeling emotional  Adriaenssens et al   
Wolf et al 
  described how nurses may feel  overwhelmed  and this condition becomes a source of moral distress that triggers feelings of powerlessness  guilt  fear  anger  and frustration The sense of frustration and impotence felt by nurses when they are unable to treat and save a patient has been highlighted as a risk factor for secondary traumatic stress in several studies  Missouridou   
Avoidance and emotional numbing can become tools for self protection from intrusive symptoms that exceed the personal tolerance level  Coetzee and Klopper    Mealer and Jones   
Their frustration obviously intensifies on a patient s death 
The onset of PTSD in the health workers involved in treating MERS was also detected after the acute phase of the emergency was over  highlighting a risk not only in the immediate period but also in the medium term period  Lee et al   In reference to COVID  updated studies conducted on Chinese health workers have already highlighted the strong impact of the epidemic on the psychological health of doctors and nurses 
Some studies have found that healthcare workers have high levels of anxiety  depression  insomnia  and distress  Lai et al    Li et al    Zhu et al   
In particular  female professionals with more than   years of experience and previous psychiatric pathology present more risk factors of developing the symptoms of stress  anxiety  and depression  Lai et al    Zhu et al   
Huang J 
Z  et al 
  studied stress levels during the COVID  emergency in a sample of medical staff 
They found that females showed higher levels of anxiety and PTSD than males did and that the levels were higher for nurses than for doctors 
Moreover  Li et al 
  found that nurses had developed higher levels of vicarious trauma than those of the general population and that nurses who did not work closely with COVID  patients showed a more severe symptomatology  both physical and psychological  compared with their colleagues working on the frontline emergency services 
In Italy  a study conducted on healthcare workers found that doctors and nurses developed high levels of stress and anxiety  greater than those developed by the general population  and that healthcare workers operating in the North  the area of Italy most affected by the virus  showed a more severe symptomatology  Simione and Gnagnarella   
This study also confirmed that females tend to have a greater perception of the risk of infection  which increases their risk of developing the symptoms of anxiety and distress Because of their long  intense exposure to various stressors  it is important to note the nature of the coping strategies used by these healthcare and emergency workers in these situations and their effectiveness in terms of reducing and effectively coping with stress 
Indeed  the effective management of stress levels in the acute emergency phase could reduce the risk of developing long term PTSD or other pathologies  such as anxiety and depression  Fullerton et al    Slottje et al    Argentero and Setti    Sakuma et al    Birinci and Erden    Li et al   
Coping may be defined as a series of cognitive and behavioral efforts to manage specific internal or external issues that test or exceed individual resources  Lazarus and Folkman   
A distinction can be made between problem focused and emotion focused coping strategies 
The former is aimed at modifying and solving the stressful situation through active interventions 
By contrast  emotion focused coping is aimed at managing the emotions connected to the stressful event and regulating affective reactions  such as anxiety and the tension of response to stress  for example  by trying to avoid the threat  denial  or re evaluating it  reappraisal The choice of coping strategies is influenced by the individual s cognitive evaluation of the event  termed secondary evaluation  which involves estimating the resources available and the most effective strategies to deal with the situation  Lazarus and Folkman   
A key element of this assessment is the extent to which the individual can maintain control over the outcome of the situation 
The literature indicates that individuals apply dysfunctional coping when they face an uncontrollable event by responding primarily with a coping strategy focused on the problem  and conversely  when they face a controllable situation  they respond with coping strategies focused on emotions  Strentz and Auerbach    Vitaliano et al   
A coping strategy may be defined as adaptive when the controllability of the stressful event corresponds with the choice of coping strategy  in this case  the subject will experience fewer symptoms related to stress  Park et al   The strategies used to cope with trauma may differ among individuals  but they can also vary according to the profession and the features of the traumatic event  Nydegger et al   
Individuals differ in their choice of coping strategies  Connor Smith and Flachsbart    and factors related to the situation can also have a decisive influence on such choice  Brown et al   
A few studies have considered the ways in which gender influences the perception of stress in emergency situations and the choice of coping strategy 
These studies highlight that females tend to perceive events as more negative and uncontrollable and to resort more to coping strategies focused on emotions and avoidance  whereas males tend to resort more to applying problem focused coping and to inhibiting emotions  Matud    Matud et al    Matud and Garcia   The literature on the relationship between coping strategies and the stress levels of emergency workers has shown that the use of coping strategies focused on the problem usually tends to correlate with lower stress levels  both in healthcare workers  Watson et al    Howlett et al    and in other emergency workers  such as firefighters  Brown et al   
However  a coping strategy frequently used by emergency workers is that of avoidance and minimization  and this strategy is associated with higher levels of stress  Brown et al    Chang et al    Kerai et al    Witt et al    Theleritis et al   
Loo et al 
  found that in a group of emergency workers  avoidance as well as coping strategies focused on emotions were associated with the development of post traumatic symptomatology 
Rodríguez Rey et al 
  revealed that among health workers working in a pediatric emergency department  approximately   of the variance in PTSD was explained by the frequent use of coping strategies focused on emotions and the infrequent use of those focused on the problem 
In addition  Kucmin et al 
  who considered a sample of   paramedics  highlighted that the risk of developing PTSD symptoms was predicted by the use of coping strategies focused on emotions However  the literature does not offer unanimous results 
Chamberlin and Green   found that in a group of firefighters  all coping strategies actually correlated with high levels of stress  the authors explained this finding by suggesting that it is not the individual coping strategies that are maladaptive in themselves  but that greater effort is needed to adjust in stressful situations 
By contrast  Young et al 
  indicated that firefighters use problem focused coping strategies more often at the beginning of the operation and emotion focused coping strategies more commonly in the phase of breakdown and fatigue 
However  after the incident  they use both strategies  Young et al   
A meta analysis by Shin et al 
  highlighted that different coping strategies have different effects on work burnout  in particular  emotional stress and depersonalization are associated with the use of emotion focused coping strategies  whereas professional ineffectiveness is associated with the use of problem focused strategies Further  a few studies have investigated the coping strategies that emergency workers can use during health emergencies similar to COVID 
Maunder et al 
  revealed that healthcare professionals who tended to apply dysfunctional coping strategies  based on avoidance  hostile comparison  or self blame  tended to develop higher stress levels 
Wong et al 
  highlighted that during the SARS epidemic  doctors and nurses tended to use different coping strategies 
The doctors tended to turn more to action planning  but this strategy did not affect their stress level 
Instead  their stress level was positively correlated with their use of coping strategies based on emotional outlets 
By contrast  the nursing staff tended to resort more to behavioral disengagement and distraction strategies  which  however  correlated with higher levels of stress among them In this regard  during the MERS epidemic  hospital staff tended to adopt coping strategies related to the use of PPE and the adoption of all prevention measures  as well as social support  whereas the coping strategy that they adopted the least was that based on an emotional outlet  Khalid et al   
A recent study on healthcare workers in Hubei  China  during the COVID  epidemic  Cai et al    yielded similar results  to reduce stress  the medical staff tended to rely on active coping strategies  such as using security protocols  practicing social isolation measures  and seeking support from family and friends  but they did not find it necessary to discuss their emotions with a professional 
Huang L  et al 
  found that a sample of nurses working during the COVID  emergency presented greater emotional reactions and turned more to problem focused coping compared with university nursing students 
Emergency workers must have sufficient self efficacy in terms of their coping skills to be able to manage and cope with stress levels 
Self efficacy in coping appears to be an effective protective factor in relation to stress levels and maladaptive responses  Chesney et al   
Self efficacy to cope with traumatic events has been effective in reducing the risk of developing PTSD  Bosmans et al   The main objective of this study is to identify the coping strategies activated by healthcare and emergency workers to deal with stress factors related to the COVID  emergency that may be associated with the risk of developing vicarious or secondary trauma 
Few studies have considered both groups simultaneously when analyzing the strategies they have adopted to manage stress during the COVID  emergency 
Hence  in this study  we are interested in detecting the similarities and differences in the approaches they adopted to manage their stress during the acute phase of the current pandemic According to Walton et al 
  the main acute stress reactions of emergency workers to emergency medical situations are emotional  cognitive  physical  and social reactions 
Therefore  these factors were included in the questionnaire used in the present study 
Moreover  reactions linked to stress factors for difficulties due to ineffective decision making and dealing with stress were also considered  Chesney et al   
In addition  fears regarding contracting the virus and infecting their own families because of COVID  were specifically considered  Du et al    Huang J 
Z  et al    Ornell et al    Walton et al   Based on results found in the literature  the specific objectives of this study are as follows Participants were selected on a voluntary basis through a trasversal sampling in order to take a picture of the situation caused by the pandemic emergency 
We used an internet platform to conduct the study and approached the participants using social media  dedicated mailing lists  and forums 
Participants from all Italian regions completed the questionnaire online 
The sample consists of   participants  males   and   females  whose average age was   years  SD     min   – max  
Further    of the sample were married    were separated  and the remaining   were single 
We selected various professional figures who had directly worked in various sectors during the COVID  emergency and who could be divided into two main groups 
The first  the  Health Group  consists of   participants   who were healthcare workers    doctors     nurses     psychologists   and seven healthcare assistants  
Their average age was   years  SD     and their average years of active professional service was    SD    
The second  the  Emergency Group  consists of   participants     emergency workers     firefighters   and   Civil Protection staff   whose average age was   years  SD     and average years of service was    SD    
There was an age difference between the two groups  t     p   and the distribution of the gender variable differed between the two groups  with   males and   females in the Health Group and   males and   females in the Emergency Group  χ    p    
The study involved participants from the entire national territory  and their workplace could be divided as follows      and   were from North  Central  and South Italy  respectively 
Further    of the sample worked directly with COVID  patients and   worked in specific COVID  departments 
Among the healthcare workers    had worked in direct contact with COVID  patients  whereas among the emergency workers  only   had assisted these patients  χ    p    
In the present study  we included two variables  lack of necessary instructions and lack of PPE  in accordance with the findings in the literature on their impact on the stress reactions of healthcare and emergency workers during the COVID  pandemic 
Among the participants    and   of healthcare and emergency workers  respectively  did not have sufficient instructions to intervene  χ    p n s 
  and   and   of healthcare and emergency workers  respectively  lacked adequate PPE when working  χ    p n s 
 This study used an online questionnaire and was conducted during the lockdown period owing to the COVID  pandemic 
The questionnaire had three parts  one each to collect online informed consent and baseline sociodemographic information  and one with an online series of questionnaires  as described in the next section 
Participants  anonymity was maintained in collecting the data 
The institutional Ethics Committee approved all the procedures This instrument s   items enable verification of the presence of two symptoms of vicarious trauma  Intrusion and Arousal  and their relative frequency 
The STSS was built on the basis of the conceptualization expressed in the DSM   American Psychiatric Association    regarding the characteristic PTSD symptoms 
In detail  the Arousal items describe situations characterized by anxiety  confusion  physical and psychological complaints  and agitation 
Intrusion refers to the re experiencing of the traumatic event even if not directly suffered through internal images and memories 
Instructions for the STSS I indicated that respondents should specify how frequently an item was true for them in the previous   weeks 
The statements are evaluated on a  point scale     never      very often  that provides scores for Intrusion  example items   I thought about my work with victims when I didn t intend to   Reminders of my work with clients upset me  and Arousal  example items   I had trouble concentrating   I was easily annoyed   I expected something bad to happen   I felt jumpy 
The reliability coefficients of the instrument are   and   for Arousal and Intrusion  respectively This is a  item measure of perceived self efficacy for coping with challenges and threats 
This measure focuses on the changes in individuals  confidence in their ability to cope effectively  based on the self efficacy theory  Bandura    Chesney et al   
Participants were asked   When things aren t going well for you  or when you re having problems  how confident or certain are you that you can do the following  Then  they were asked to rate on an  point scale the extent to which they believed they could perform important behaviors for adaptive coping 
The instrument yields three subscale scores   problem focused coping   α      stop unpleasant emotions and thoughts   α     and  support   α    
Anchor points on the scale are    cannot do at all     moderately certain can do  and    certain can do We constructed an ad hoc  item questionnaire that included Yes No questions to detect stress factors identified by the literature  such as the availability of suitable equipment and the receipt of clear instructions during the COVID  coping experience 
In this study  we present the results related to two of these items   Instructions  which refers to having received the necessary instructions to intervene  and  Equipment  which refers to having PPE 
Predictions of these factors have also been made in other studies  Du et al    Walton et al   
In light of the relevance and specificity of the lack of clear information or instructions and adequate PPE in the management of COVID  in the Italian context  as well as the findings in other studies  we decided to focus attention on these two risk factors Our analysis of the literature revealed that in situations in which they have to cope with a pandemic  several factors may affect the stress of medical staff and emergency healthcare workers and that COVID  represents an independent specific stressor  Spoorthy   
These stress factors have been identified as frequently affecting healthcare and emergency workers in emergency situations and leading to physical  emotional  cognitive  decision making  relational  and organizational stress  Del Missier et al    Sbattella    Argentero and Setti    Fraccaroli and Balducci    Bellelli and Di Schiena    Du et al    Walton et al   
Focusing on the specificity of the COVID  epidemic  items have been constructed regarding the fears of contracting the infection and of infecting colleagues or family members  Walton et al    since COVID  represents a factor of independent stress  Spoorthy    that has great impact  Huang J 
Z  et al   
Consequently  we constructed the ESQ consisting of   items assessed on a  point Likert scale  with scores ranging from    not at all  to    very much  grouped into six scales 
The participants were asked to indicate how often they experienced certain emotions and thoughts while performing intervention and emergency activities during the COVID  pandemic The scales correspond to the factors identified and confirmed by factorial analysis through an analysis of the main components with orthogonal rotation of factors  varimax 
The number of factors to be extracted was initially verified through the unit s largest eigenvalue criterion and  subsequently  by the scree test 
The ESQ is based on six scales The ESQ demonstrated good internal consistency  α     overall and for each individual scale  Organizational–Relational Stress  α     Physical Stress  α     Inefficacy Decisional Stress  α     Emotional Stress  α     Cognitive stress  α     and COVID  Stress  α    First  we performed Pearson s correlation analyses to identify the associations between the variables for the two groups that we considered in this study 
Subsequently  we checked for significant differences between the two groups as their stress levels  coping strategies  and secondary trauma 
We used hierarchical linear regression models to verify the predictive effect of the risk factors  lack of adequate information and PPE  on the different stress levels  in step  
Then  we verified the protective effect of the coping strategies  in step  
The models were controlled for age  gender  and group 
Lastly  we used hierarchical regression models to verify the predictive effect of stress factors on the components of secondary trauma 
The models were controlled for age  gender  and group First  we conducted correlational analyses and comparisons of averages on the reference sample 
Table   shows the correlations between the scales of the ESQ and the other instruments Preliminary comparisons were made through the Student s t test between the Health Group and the Emergency Group in relation to the ESQ  CSES SF  and STSS I scores 
Table   shows the comparison between the two groups As shown in Table   significant differences emerged between the two groups in relation to their Stress and Arousal levels 
The results indicate higher levels of both for the Health Group  and that emergency workers turn more to the Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts strategy 
Further  we performed comparisons with reference to the gender variable to detect differences in the levels of stress factors  coping strategies  and secondary trauma 
Females reported significantly higher Physical Stress than males did  Females  M     SD     Males  M     SD     t     p     as well as Emotional Stress  Females  M     SD     Males  M     SD     t     p     and COVID  Stress  Females  M     SD     Males  M     SD     t     p    
No gender difference emerged in coping strategies and secondary trauma 
Within the Health Group  there were significant differences regarding Inefficacy Decisional Stress  F     p     Doctor M     SD     Psychologist M     SD     average difference     p     and COVID  Stress  F     p     Nurse M     SD     Doctor M     SD     difference     p    
Within the Emergency Group  there were no differences in levels of stress and secondary trauma or coping strategies 
Moreover  we found similar correlations between the two groups for the Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts strategy and the stress factors  whereas for the other two coping strategies  we found a different association  particularly for the Emergency Group 
However  the t test comparisons highlight differences only at the level of the Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts strategy 
Given the findings of the preliminary analyses  we considered it necessary to include the age  gender  and group variables to test the predictiveness of the coping strategies on the participants  stress levels To test the predictive effect of the coping strategies on various levels of stress  hierarchical regression was conducted 
Considering the Age and Gender differences within the groups  we included these variables in all models together with the Group variable  Health vs 
Emergency  and the  Instructions  and  Equipment  variables 
The models generated by assuming the ESQ scales as dependent variables are shown in Table  
Regarding the coping strategies  we observed an important effect of the Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts Coping strategy on all the stress scales  except for Physical Stress where the effect of the Focused Problem Coping strategy is recorded As shown in Table   significant negative associations between stressors and secondary trauma were found for both groups 
The hierarchical regression models of stress scales were analyzed for the Arousal and Intrusion levels of secondary trauma 
The models included the Age  Gender  Health Emergency Group variables  and the ESQ scales 
The results are shown in Table  The same regression models were generated by including coping strategies as predictors and were analyzed by Age  Gender  and Health Emergency Group 
Compared with Arousal  the Health Emergency Group and Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts are predictive  R    F     p     Beta  ∗∗∗  Beta  ∗  respectively 
Compared with Intrusion  only the Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts variable  R    F     p     Beta  ∗  assumes significance This study has several limitations 
The first is the limited sample size 
The second is that our study involved participants in the very midst of the COVID  emergency  which means that the level of stress in healthcare workers may have been more severe and acute 
Moreover  the long term psychological implications for the healthcare and emergency population should be investigated for the presence of a full secondary trauma 
Therefore  a large sized longitudinal study is called for to further explore the pathogenesis of vicarious traumatization 
The third is that participants were not selected based on whether they had existing psychological problems 
In proposing the hypothesis of this study  we anticipated that we would be able to discover the relationships between coping strategies  emergency related stress  and secondary trauma in healthcare and emergency workers and commenced our investigation by assuming that the impact of stress can provoke psychological consequences in emergency situations 
In future work  this assumption could be tested to verify whether an emergency situation has a different impact on workers who have already experienced psychological problems The raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors  without undue reservation  to any qualified researcher The studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by Comitato Etico per la Sperimentazione Umana – CESU of the University of Urbino

As reported by some  the association of acute kidney injury  AKI  and COVID  has a high mortality   
However  the incidence of reported AKI associated with COVID  varies widely             
It would be expected that kidney involvement is frequent since the virus enters the cell through the angiotensin converting enzyme    ACE  which is expressed  in addition to pulmonary type   alveolar cells  on renal proximal tubular cells  glomerular visceral and parietal epithelium  and the cytoplasm of the distal tubules and collecting ducts         
In addition  COVID  induces hemodynamic instability and severe inflammation  which  in addition to direct renal infection  can induce acute tubular necrosis  ATN 
We report our experience with AKI in COVID  patients in an inner city  predominantly minority  and a low socioeconomic group and compare our experience with other studies in significantly different cohorts of patients 
We identify the incidence  risk factors  and prognosis of AKI and thus provide a broader understanding of this complication in a group of patients not specifically reported upon to date All adult patients   years of age admitted to the Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center with COVID  infection from March   through April     were studied in this retrospective analysis done in a single medical center serving a low income minority population in Brooklyn  NY 
It was one of the single centers with the most admissions of COVID  patients 
COVID  infection was diagnosed based on clinical presentation  radiographic lung abnormalities  and a positive result of real time PCR 
We excluded COVID  patients from our study if they were on maintenance hemodialysis or were renal transplant recipients 
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Brookdale Hospital and did not require patient consent because of its retrospective design We collected the demographics  the presenting clinical symptoms when available  prior medical history including outpatient medications and prior level of renal function  comorbidities  and in hospital laboratory data from the electronic medical record  Epic Hyperspace   
Laboratory data consisted of complete blood count  hemostasis parameters  renal and liver function  PF ratio  arterial oxygen partial pressure  PaO  fractional inspired oxygen  FiO   creatinine kinase  lactate dehydrogenase  and inflammatory markers including high sensitivity C reactive protein  hs CRP  ferritin  and D dimer 
Normal range of these measures was provided by our laboratory The Kidney Disease  Improving Global Outcome  KDIGO    definition was used to identify AKI 
Estimated glomerular filtration rate  eGFR  on admission was taken as baseline eGFR and was divided into   and ≥  mL min  m 
eGFR was estimated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study  MDRD  equation 
The earliest day of the serum creatinine change that met the KDIGO criteria for AKI was selected as day   of AKI 
The peak serum creatinine value was used to determine the stage of AKI  with an increase in the serum creatinine of  –   –  and   times the baseline serum creatinine defined as AKI stages     and   respectively Continuous variables were described as mean   standard deviation for normally distributed data  or median and interquartile range  IQR  values for non normal distribution 
Categorical variables were presented as frequency and percentage 
The mean of continuous variables was compared by using independent t tests  the Wilcoxon rank sum test  and the Kruskal Wallis test  across the stages of AKI 
The proportion of categorical variables was compared by using χ  test 
Fischer s exact test was used when there were only limited data available 
The Kaplan Meier method  log rank test  was used to determine the cumulative incidence of in hospital mortality 
We used the Cox proportional hazard  PH  regression to determine the association of kidney disease indicators and in hospital mortality 
The assumptions of the Cox PH model were checked using the Schoenfeld residuals  and no violations of the assumptions were present 
In the multivariable analysis  separate Cox PH models were used to determine the association of baseline eGFR and blood urea nitrogen  BUN  on admission  proteinuria  hematuria  and stages of AKI with in hospital mortality since these variables showed a highly significant correlation 
Variables for Cox PH regression were selected using stepwise regression 
Variables with α level of risk factor   were entered into the model 
While evaluating the association of hematuria and proteinuria with in hospital mortality by the Cox PH model  patients with missing values  n     were excluded from the analysis 
All statistical analyses were performed using the STATA version   software and a p value of   was used to determine statistical significance In this study    adult confirmed cases of COVID  were initially reviewed 
Patients on maintenance hemodialysis  n     were excluded from the study and   patients were used for the analysis 
Baseline characteristics of these patients are shown in Table  
  of our cohort were African Americans and   were Hispanics 
The median age of the patients was   years  IQR  –  and   of them were male 
Most of these patients presented with dyspnea   cough   and fever  
  of the patients had a systolic blood pressure below   mm Hg at presentation 
   n     of all patients were mechanically ventilated during the hospitalization 
The median values of ferritin  D dimer  hs CRP  creatinine kinase and lactose dehydrogenase were elevated above their reference ranges  see online suppl

The development of AKI was seen earlier in the course in patients with an eGFR   mL min  m  at presentation   vs    and occurred within   h of admission 
Patients who developed AKI during the hospitalization were more likely to have a systolic blood pressure of   mm Hg at presentation and a lesser PF ratio and were more likely to be intubated during the course of hospitalization  Table  
Eighteen out of   patients with documented chronic kidney disease  CKD  prior to admission developed AKI during the hospitalization

Table  The number of patients requiring renal replacement therapy  RRT  during the hospitalization was  
This represented   of all patients and   of those with AKI 
All the patients who required RRT by definition had stage   AKI 
The modalities of RRT were continuous RRT in   patients   of all those who required RRT  and intermittent hemodialysis in   patients  
Two patients   required both modalities of RRT 
    out of   of those patients who required mechanical ventilation developed AKI compared with     out of   of nonventilated patients 
Of these   patients      required RRT 
The majority of AKI stage   patients requiring RRT were on mechanical ventilation   out of   requiring RRT 
  of the patients who were treated with RRT   out of   patients  died during the hospitalization 
Of those with stage   AKI who were not dialyzed    died

The in hospital mortality of AKI patients was     out of   who developed AKI died   Table  A significantly higher in hospital mortality was observed in patients with an eGFR   mL min  m  at presentation  elevated BUN at presentation  and in hospital AKI using the Kaplan Meier analysis  Fig

In a multivariable Cox PH model  adjusted for age  gender  PF ratio  hemodynamic status  and comorbidities  diabetes  HTN  hyperlipidemia  cancer  and stroke  eGFR   mL min  m  at presentation  BUN on admission  and AKI greater than or equal to stage   was associated with a higher risk of in hospital mortality 
There was no significant association between in hospital mortality and proteinuria and or hematuria  Table  AKI is common among hospitalized patients  incidence  –  and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality       
In our cohort of   COVID  patients  a relatively higher percentage of patients     of   developed in hospital AKI 
Current evidence suggests that AKI in COVID  patients is a result of an interplay of virus mediated injury  a dysregulated inflammatory response  angiotensin II pathway activation  hypercoagulation  and microangiopathy   
These COVID specific factors likely interact with the other known risk factors for AKI  such as hemodynamic instability  hypoxia  and sepsis  which increased over time 
The increase in the cumulative incidence of AKI over time in our cohort is likely associated with concomitant clinical deterioration and less likely represent a unique renal effect of COVID 
Compared to studies of AKI in COVID  patients from other countries  we found our incidence to be higher than that reported from   Asian countries  –  and is similar to that in an Italian study             
However  it is lower than that in the more recent report by Hirsch et al 
  who detailed their experience in   academic and community hospitals in metropolitan New York   none of which are located in the inner city  lower socioeconomic neighborhoods with a predominant minority population 
As compared with the above cited studies  the incidence of stage   AKI   was highest in our cohort 
It is not possible to determine with certainty the cause s  of this wide variation 
However  we did note a higher prevalence of comorbid conditions in our group 
For example  Cheng et al 
  reported a   incidence of AKI  with a   prevalence of HTN and a   prevalence of DM in their study population 
In our cohort  roughly twice as many   had HTN  and more than   times as many   were diabetic  Table  
Also  the incidence of severe lung involvement that required mechanical ventilation was lower   than ours    Table  
Mechanical ventilation per se has been reported to be strongly associated with AKI   
In our cohort  the incidence of AKI was also higher among those requiring mechanical ventilation  We identified various risk factors for AKI in our study  Tables    
Similar to previous reports  our patients with AKI were more likely to be male  have a history of HTN  and have severe respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation     
In our study  higher BMI increased the likelihood of developing severe AKI 
A low eGFR at presentation more than doubled the risk of developing AKI  p      Table  
Patients with lower eGFR had a significantly higher cumulative incidence of AKI than those with eGFR   mL min  m   p     Fig 
 
Thus  there was a synergistic effect of reduced baseline kidney function and subsequent AKI 
We did not find an association between diabetes and in hospital AKI The role of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors  ACEi  in COVID  is a subject of ongoing debate 
ACEi can increase the expression of ACE  the receptor used by SARS CoV  to enter target cells     
However  ACE  has been shown to be beneficial in acute respiratory distress syndrome when replaced     
This possible protective effect is attributed to the degradation of proinflammatory angiotensin II to angiotensin by ACE 
At present  it remains unclear if ACEi facilitate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus    SARS CoV  cellular entry and intracellular virus replication and whether ACEi improve acute respiratory distress syndrome outcomes 
In our cohort  the use of ACEi was significantly higher in patients with a lower admitting eGFR  Table   and in those who experienced AKI  Table  
We found a similar association between AKI and non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs  but not with angiotensin II receptor blockers  ARBs  in our cohort  Table  
Further studies are necessary to delineate the relationship between ACEi  angiotensin II receptor blockers  and COVID  outcomes Markers of acute inflammation  ferritin and CRP  muscle injury  creatinine kinase  myocardial injury  and D dimer levels were significantly higher in patients with a low eGFR at presentation  online suppl 
Table   and in those with AKI  online suppl 
Table   suggesting causality by a dysregulated immune inflammatory response  the so called  cytokine storm We found an extremely high incidence of mortality in our study cohort 
High presenting BUN and low eGFR   mL min  m  were significantly associated with increased mortality  Table  
AKI was significantly associated with increased mortality 
The mortality risk was highest in stage   AKI  HR   CI  –   Table  
Mortality was   in the AKI group and   in the non AKI group  p    
Mortality rose concurrently with the AKI stages      and   for stages     and   respectively  Table  
These rates were over   and  fold higher than those reported by Hirsch et al 
    AKI    in non AKI 
However  our cohort s high mortality is similar to the findings of John Hopkins University and the American Community Survey 
They reported a   and  fold higher COVID  infection and mortality rate in predominantly African American counties than in predominantly white counties   
Wadhera et al 
  also reported a death rate of   per   in Brooklyn  about   higher than that of Manhattan 
Moreover  in New York City  current age adjusted mortality is highest among African Americans and about   times that of whites   Our hospital provides medical services for an ethnic minority and a low income population in the most impoverished neighborhood in Brooklyn  where   of the residents live below the Federal Poverty Level as per a   report   
  of our patients identified themselves as African Americans 
In comparison  in the study by Hirsch et al 
     identified themselves as whites  and only   identified themselves as African Americans 
The high representation of ethnic minorities in our study population may have contributed to the increased mortality 
This association has been widely publicized and is likely the result of a complex interplay of multiple factors 
These include  but are not limited to  a high burden of comorbidities  genetics  the pernicious influence of adverse socioeconomic determinants of health  the absence of the privilege to work from home  and the ability to follow the recommended social distancing   In our cohort      of the   patients with AKI required RRT 
Nineteen out of these   patients   were mechanically ventilated 
Thus  almost all of the additional requirements for acute dialysis during the COVID  pandemic at our institution were in intensive care units 
Overall      out of   of mechanically ventilated patients required RRT 
Elevated ferritin was associated with an increased risk of all stages of AKI and the need for RRT  online suppl 
Table  
Among those who received RRT      died versus     in the stage   AKI group who did not undergo RRT  p      Table  
Thus  there was no statistically significant improvement in survival  and the mortality remained extremely high in both the RRT and non RRT groups 
These findings should prompt the early involvement of a palliative care team to define goals of care in patients with COVID  disease and stage   AKI In our experience  ultrafiltration was not well tolerated 
It often increased pressor requirements and did little to improve the ventilatory status 
We observed a high incidence of hypercoagulability and frequent clotting of the dialysis filters  lines  and catheters 
Thus  the patients required higher than the usual doses of heparin Our study has limitations 
Although     of the study population had a low eGFR on admission  only     had a documented history of CKD 
Data were collected retrospectively from medical records and often did not have information regarding prior renal function 
Patients also may have had an elevated creatinine on admission secondary to AKI suffered prior to hospitalization 
If so  we may have underestimated the true overall incidence of COVID associated AKI 
It is not possible to rectify this problem  given the data at our disposal Our study is a single center study  with the majority of the study population identifying themselves as African Americans or Hispanics 
This limits our study s general applicability but provides a unique insight into this population and broadens our understanding of COVID  disease 
Data were missing on many patients at different stages of the hospitalization since they were collected retrospectively 
Importantly  little data were available regarding urine output  a defining characteristic of AKI 
With this lack of information  we may have again underestimated the true incidence of AKI Nevertheless  even with the above limitations of our study  the high incidence of AKI and its negative impact upon survival is abundantly clear 
In response to the high incidence of AKI in our patients with COVID  we increased our capacity to deliver RRT 
These efforts included the purchase of additional machines and dialysis solutions  additional staff training  and engineering alterations to allow dialysis on the general medical floors 
Also  we increased our stockpiles of catheters  filters  and dialysis solutions for intermittent and continuous RRT 
We also plan to establish a peritoneal dialysis program to further strengthen our acute dialysis capacity In conclusion  our data report explicitly upon a high proportion of ethnic minority patients in an inner city  severely economically deprived neighborhood  previously not studied 
Our patients experienced a high incidence of AKI and an extremely high mortality  especially in AKI stage  
Unfortunately  RRT provided little survival benefit 
Policy changes and planning in preparation for this high incidence of AKI in COVID  patients are necessary at the local and national levels Study was approved by Institutional Review Board  IRB  Brookdale Hospital The authors have no conflicts of interests to declare The authors did not receive any funding U Z

  supervisor Dynamic changes in computed tomography manifestations of   patients
with novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan  ChinaDuring the first week of December   a few cases of pneumonia caused by a novel
coronavirus appeared in Wuhan  Hubei Province  China 
The patients had a history of
visiting the nearby Huanan seafood market  where wild animals were sold  With the spread of the disease  such cases have also been found in other
parts of China and abroad 
As of   July     cases have been confirmed
worldwide  including   deaths and   recoveries The novel coronavirus was originally named   novel coronavirus  nCoV  it was
recently officially renamed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus  
 SARS CoV  by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses 
The disease
caused by SARS CoV  has been named coronavirus disease    COVID  by the World
Health Organization 
Like SARS CoV  SARS CoV  likely originated in bats  however 
the intermediary animal host remains unclear 
The nearest neighbor of the  nCoV
isolates from China is a bat SARS like coronavirus  Bat SL CoVZC SARS CoV  carries a high risk of human to human transmission  and such transmission
has been reported in family clusters and among medical workers  The main route of transmission
is respiratory droplets and contact transmission  the virus may also be transmitted
through the conjunctiva and via aerosols  Current epidemiological surveys indicate that the latency period generally
ranges from   to   days  with a maximum of   days 
Affected patients present with
pneumonia like symptoms  including fever  fatigue  cough  expectoration 
pharyngalgia  anorexia  and myalgia 
Some patients also have gastrointestinal
symptoms  including diarrhea  nausea  vomiting  and abdominal pain 
In severe cases 
patients may rapidly develop acute respiratory distress syndrome  septic shock 
difficult to correct metabolic acidosis  and coagulation dysfunction Increasing numbers of studies are suggesting the high clinical value of imaging
examinations  especially high resolution computed tomography  HRCT  of the chest  in
patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia –  Typical CT imaging
manifestations include multiple patchy subsegmental or segmental ground glass
opacities  GGOs  and consolidation in the bilateral lungs  The imaging manifestations in patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia often
change rapidly  and many patients thus undergo repeated CT examinations 
Some
patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia gradually improve  whereas others develop
persistent hypoxemia or dyspnea and gradually worsen 
The changes in the patient s
condition are often closely related to the severity of the lung lesions 
Therefore 
observing the evolution of the lung lesions by chest CT is very important to assess
and predict the patient s outcome This study was to performed observe the changes in the chest HRCT manifestations of
  patients with pneumonia caused by SARS CoV  from the time of the initial
diagnosis 
To our knowledge  this is the largest population evaluated to date among
studies of the dynamic changes in imaging manifestations of novel coronavirus
pneumonia Consecutive patients were retrospectively enrolled in this single center study
from   January   to   February  
These patients met the Diagnosis and
Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia  trial version   issued by the National
Health Commission of the People s Republic of China  and their diagnoses were confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction 
According to the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus
Pneumonia  trial version   issued by the Chinese National Health Committee 
patients who developed severe pneumonia during their disease course were
excluded 
Severe pneumonia was defined as severe respiratory distress
 respiratory rate of   breaths minute  a requirement for oxygen treatment
or mechanical ventilation  an oxygen saturation of   on room air  a
partial arterial oxygen pressure fraction of inspired oxygen ratio of ≤  mmHg 
shock  or pneumonia combined with other organ failure All patients were examined using a Discovery CT  HD scanner  GE Healthcare 
Chicago  IL  USA  during a single inspiratory phase 
Before the examination  the
medical staff guided the patient to hold his or her breath and inhale 
After
complete exhalation  the patient held his or her breath  and a CT scan was
performed from the bottom of the lung to the apex of the lung 
The tube voltage
was   kVp with automatic tube current modulation 
The scan time was   s  the
scan interval was   mm  and the scan layer thickness was   mm 
After scanning 
adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction of   and the standard algorithm
were adopted  and the reconstruction layer thickness was   mm 
No contrast
agent was used during the CT scan 
Most patients underwent multiple chest CT
examinations  largely because the clinicians were still unclear about the
evolution tendencies of the lung lesions associated with COVID  pneumonia 
Additionally  some patients had symptoms such as hypoxemia or dyspnea due to
rapid disease progression 
Therefore  multiple chest CT examinations were
required to observe the progress or absorption of pneumonia The major CT manifestations were described using internationally standard
nomenclature defined by the Fleischner Society glossary  using terms such as
GGO  consolidation  and fibrous strips  A semi quantitative scoring system was used to estimate the pulmonary
involvement of all of these abnormalities on the basis of the area involved  Each of the five lung lobes was visually scored from   to   as follows 
  no involvement      involvement      to   involvement      to
  involvement      to   involvement  and     involvement 
The
total CT score was the sum of the individual lobar scores and ranged from    no
involvement  to    maximum involvement 
The number of affected lung lobes was
also recorded 
The images were transferred to an AW  workstation  GE
Healthcare  and anonymized 
All images were evaluated by two radiologists with
more than   years of work experience  and the final scores were determined by
consensus Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS Statistics for Windows  Version
   SPSS Inc  Chicago  IL  USA 
Measurement data are expressed as
mean   standard deviation  minimum–maximum  and categorical data are presented
as the percentage of the group 
A P value of   was defined as
statistically significant In total    CT scans of   patients   men    women  with confirmed COVID 
were collected 
The patients  ages ranged from   to   years  and their mean
age was       years 
Fever was the most common symptom  Table  
The patients
underwent        –  chest CT examinations  and the interval between the
first and last scan was       days  –  days The laboratory results are presented in Table  
Most laboratory results were
normal  with mildly elevated concentrations of C reactive protein
      mg L  D dimers       mg L  and ferritin      
µg L Based on clinical experience  five stages were identified from the onset of
initial symptoms  Stage A  –  days  n     Stage B  –  days  n     Stage
C  –  days  n     Stage D  –  days  n     and Stage E   days 
n    
One patient had a  day history of cough with fever and was in Stage B
at the time of admission 
The frequencies of different lesions in different
stages are presented in Table  
Two patients in Stage A and one patient in Stage E had no
lesions 
Multiple lobes were involved in most of the CT scans in all stages 
Multiple lobe involvement was present in     patients in Stage A   
  in Stage B      in Stage C      in Stage D  and    
in Stage E  GGOs could be seen in all stages  and the proportion of GGOs in each
stage was similar 
The proportion of consolidation first increased and then
decreased over time 
GGOs and consolidation were present in     and  
  patients in Stage A      and     in Stage B     
and     in Stage C      and     in Stage D  and    
and     in Stage E  respectively 
The consolidations in some cases were
absorbed As shown in Table  
the total CT score also first increased and then decreased over time  and the
total CT score of pulmonary involvement was significantly higher in Stage B than
in Stage A       vs        respectively  P    
Additionally  the
total CT score of lung involvement was significantly higher in Stage C than in
Stages B and D       vs         P     and       vs       
 P     respectively 
The number of involved lobes was significantly higher
in Stage B than in Stage A       vs        respectively  P    
Notably  the CT score of the lower lobe was significantly higher than the
corresponding upper and middle lobes in Stages A  B  C  and D  P     for
all 
In Stage E  the CT score of the right lower lobe was significantly higher
than that of the right upper middle lobes  P     and P    
respectively  whereas no significant difference was observed in the CT score
between the left lower lobe and left upper lobe The CT images of a patient with novel coronavirus pneumonia are shown in Figure  
GGOs and
consolidation first increased from Stage A to Stage C  after which the
consolidation gradually absorbed  the GGOs then gradually decreased in Stages D
and E Since the end of   an outbreak of a novel pneumonia in Wuhan has been drawing
tremendous attention around the world 
Chinese government officials and researchers
have taken swift measures to control the outbreak and conduct etiological studies 
The causative agent of this pneumonia has been identified as SARS CoV  a novel
coronavirus 
As its name suggests  its genetic structure is   similar to that of SARS CoV The most frequently affected organ of the novel coronavirus is the lung 
In the
previous version of the diagnosis and treatment guideline for pneumonia caused by
novel coronavirus  the diagnosis was confirmed by the presence of viral nucleic
acids in throat swabs  sputum  and alveolar lavage fluid 
However  the more recent
guideline indicates that if typical chest CT findings are observed in patients
suspected to have COVID  the patient should be clinically diagnosed 
This
reflects the important role of chest CT in the diagnosis 
Moreover  current clinical
experience is showing that the chest CT manifestations change rapidly 
Therefore 
many patients in the present study underwent multiple repeated examinations during
treatment 
To our knowledge  this study is by far the largest case series of
follow up imaging among patients with COVID SARS CoV  infects human respiratory epithelial cells through S protein and has a
strong infection capacity for humans 
Coronavirus particles have a diameter of   to
  nm and can directly reach the bottom of the lung 
Because of lung volume and
gravity  respiratory airflow  and other factors  the type II alveolar epithelial
cells present at the bottom of the lung become the target cells of the coronavirus 
Therefore  the lesions are mainly distributed under the pleura or along the vascular
bronchial bundle  After the alveolar epithelial cells have become combined with the virus  the
alveolar wall is damaged and large numbers of immune cells and lymphocytes
accumulate  resulting in swelling around the lung leaflets and blood vessel
congestion 
The pulmonary lobules merge with each other  forming nodular or patchy
GGOs 
As the disease progresses  multiple lung segments become involved  the scope
of the lesion expands  the alveolar wall shrinks and collapses  and the exfoliated
and necrotic epithelium and the exuded inflammatory cells form a hyaline membrane 
These changes manifest as coexisting imaging abnormalities such as GGOs  nodules 
consolidation  and fibrous cord strips Several studies have focused on the evolution of CT changes in patients with COVID 
pneumonia 
Pan et al  analyzed the disease course according to  day stages and found that the CT
score was the highest on days   to   of the disease course  after   days  the CT
score of the lower lung was significantly higher than that of the middle and upper
lungs 
Zhou et al  found that CT images of patients with COVID  pneumonia showed a
predominantly peripheral  middle  lower  and posterior distribution 
The early rapid
progressive stage was   to   days from symptom onset  the advanced stage with peak
levels of CT abnormalities occurred from   to   days  and the abnormalities started
to improve after   days 
Lei et al  reported that patients with COVID  pneumonia had a typical transition from
the early stage to the advanced stage and then from the advanced stage to the
dissipating stage 
Single or multiple GGOs were distributed along the
bronchovascular or subpleural regions in the pulmonary parenchyma in the early
stage  higher density consolidations were observed in the advanced stage  and the
GGOs and consolidations were absorbed in the dissipating stage 
Xiang et al  evaluated only six patients with COVID  pneumonia and reported that the CT
score peaked at   to   days and that the CT scores of the lower lobes were
significantly higher than those of the middle upper lobes after   days from disease
onset 
These findings were consistent with those reported by Pan et al  Liang et al  reported that the majority of patients had involvement of three or more
lobes 
Bilateral involvement was more prevalent than unilateral involvement 
The
proportions of patients observed to have pure GGOs or GGOs and consolidation
decreased over time  while the proportion of patients with GGOs and linear opacities
increased 
The total severity score showed an increasing trend in the first   weeks 
Bernheim et al  divided the disease course into three stages  –   –  and  –  days  and
found that   of patients in the first stage had normal CT findings 
As the time
since onset of symptoms increased  the CT abnormalities became more frequent  these
findings included consolidation  bilateral and peripheral disease  greater total
lung involvement  linear opacities  the  crazy paving  pattern  and the  reverse
halo  sign In this study  we evaluated the CT findings of   patients with COVID  pneumonia
confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction 
The patients underwent
a mean of        range   –  chest CT examinations 
At present  the course of
COVID  pneumonia and when patients should be re examined remain inconclusive 
As
mentioned above  different studies have staged the disease according to different
time periods 
We grouped the patients  CT scans at different time intervals 
The
time interval grouping was based on current clinical experience and is consistent
with the imaging interval described in the pneumonia diagnosis and treatment guidelines  This grouping is also partially similar to that described by Pan et al  and Zhou et al  Multiple lobe involvement was observed in most patients in all stages  and
lower lobe lesions were significantly more common than upper and middle lobe
lesions  this is also consistent with the findings reported by Pan et al  and Liang et al  As mentioned above  most studies have suggested that patients with COVID 
pneumonia undergo a typical transition from the early stage to the advanced stage
and then from the advanced stage to the dissipating stage  however  the time to
reach the peak of the disease course varies among different studies  and the
patients in our study showed a similar tendency 
GGOs and consolidation were the
common chest CT manifestations  the proportion of GGOs in each stage was similar 
while consolidation and the total CT score first increased and then decreased over
time 
The total CT score was significantly higher in Stage B than in Stage A  while
the total CT score was significantly higher in Stage C than in Stage B 
These
findings suggest that the lung lesions of most patients significantly improved after
  days and that most patients with new coronavirus pneumonia had a disease course
of more than   days This study had three main limitations 
First  we did not consider the effects of
factors such as age  sex  medical history  including hypertension  hyperlipidemia 
hyperglycemia  and malignant tumors  and lifestyle habits  including smoking and
drinking history  on patient outcomes 
Second  although   patients with novel
coronavirus pneumonia were included in this study  the number of patients in Stages
B to E was limited 
Future studies should include more patients and extend the
observation time to ensure that the study results are more representative 
Third 
some studies have suggested that factors such as age  the C reactive protein
concentration  and the interleukin  β concentration may be related to patient
outcomes 
However  we did not perform a correlation analysis between the laboratory
data and patient outcomes In conclusion  we followed up and evaluated   chest CT scans of   patients with
confirmed COVID  pneumonia and found that most patients had a disease course of
more than   days and that the lung lesions of most patients improved significantly
after   days 
The purpose of this study is to help clinicians better understand the
disease course and properly perform chest CT re examinations for patients with
COVID  pneumonia to minimize the radiation dose Transdermal Delivery Systems for BiomoleculesDrug delivery is related to many problems focused on the molecular stability  pharmacokinetic  and amphoteric nature of a substance 
Due to chemical instability and high degradation by enzymatic action regardless of the distance to the specific target organ  all of this is more complicated when the bioactive substance that is intended to be administered is a biomolecule  such as peptides and proteins   Currently  there is a system that is applied to the protein drug delivery  which is a non conventional system developed primarily for protein and peptide drug delivery 
This new delivery system has a higher efficiency that improves the passage of the protein drug to the skin   
The transdermal drug delivery  TDD  system reduces potential exposure to side effects in the host and improves protein stability by also reducing enzymatic degradation  which is very common to occur when a drug takes the most conventional routes to enter the body  such as oral and subcutaneous routes 
Mainly  TDD systems avoid the first pass of metabolism  which occurs in the liver   
The protein and peptide drugs are important in many innovative treatments  such as immunotherapy  where biomolecules  such as antibodies  growth factors  and interleukins  are used 
These are proteins with high susceptibility to degradation to many endogenous and exogenous factors  such as temperature and pH  and most importantly  enzymatic degradation and immune clearance One of the most important advantages of the transdermal route is to maintain drug release in a constant and prolonged release to achieve optimal blood circulation concentrations   
For transdermal protein drug delivery systems  specific methods or devices are used to allow or enhance intact passage through the stratum corneum  SC 
The most suitable systems for the release of biomolecules are the third generation transdermal delivery systems  whose effects are directed to the SC 
For TDD systems of biomolecules and vaccines  thermal ablation and microneedles are the most widely used physical penetration enhancers 
However  there are many other systems that have been tested for transdermal release of biomolecules   that have been included in the second and third generation of transdermal delivery systems  such as iontophoresis and electroporation This article highlights the main technologies used as tools that improve transdermal protein drug delivery systems  addressing them from the point of view of research in the development of transdermal systems where many technologies and devices have a high possibility of use in conventional drug treatments  such as nanotechnology devices 
The authors provide an overview of the various systems that exist in TDD that have been tested and proposed for the transdermal delivery of biomolecules The skin is a three layer laminate that is made up of the SC  the epidermis  and the dermis   
The epidermis is the outermost layer and is formed from the stratified epithelium  the stratum germinativum  spinosum  granulosum  lucidum  and corneum   Fig 
 The SC is the outermost and impermeable skin layer that prevents the entry of most chemicals   
This barrier is formed by around   to   lines of dead keratinocytes  corneocytes  that have united with each other with corneodesmosomes forming a wall embedded in a lipidic matrix 
The extracellular matrix is formed by lipids  such as fatty acids  ceramides  cholesterol  cholesterol sulfate  and sterol wax esters arranged in lamellae  and multiple lipid bilayers  although the matrix is primarily composed of ceramides     
Corneocytes contain involucrin  loricrin  and cornifin around their periphery and have a thickness of   μm  but this can be modified by factors such as hydration and the anatomic site of the skin   
This stratum contains high amounts of keratin inside the corneocytes  and the keratin filaments provide the hexagonal shape and stratum mechanical strength of the corneocyte   
In addition  the SC acts as a barrier  preventing desiccation and pathogen entry and protecting against ultraviolet rays 
The SC also plays an important role in wound repair The transdermal delivery route has been used many times for the local application of therapeutic substances  and it is a practice that is still used and that will continue to grow in the coming years The transdermal drug delivery systems also allow homogeneous absorption and have good pharmaceutical efficiency  reducing the adverse effects that drugs could cause in the host and reduce the drug risk to suffer alterations caused by enzymatic factors and the immune system present in the intrinsic environment 
Besides that  these systems are more comfortable for the patient   This method is formed by steps that start when the therapeutic molecule enters the skin until it enters the blood circulation 
The first step is penetration  which occurs when the drug is deposited onto the specific skin layer 
Later  the permeation step occurs when the molecule diffuses from one layer to another 
Finally  in the resorption process  the drug enters the bloodstream     This type of drug delivery system has advantages over traditional systems because it can allow the storage of small amounts of drugs in the transport and delivery structure  which are developed by nanotechnology using mainly polymeric nanomaterials made with biopolymers  microneedles  and nanoparticles With these devices  it is possible to improve drug delivery and its bioavailability 
Thus  it is possible to reduce the frequency between drug administrations 
The most innovative property is that the device is only replaced when the dose is finished and it can take several days     
The exact side effects that they could trigger are unknown  since they could mainly depend on the type of bioactive drug it contains  which could be related to some effects of the mechanical properties of the skin    Table  Peptides and proteins have long been important resources in the treatment of many diseases 
Many of the therapies that are applied for many diseases have recently used peptides and proteins  which is called biological therapy and focuses on the production of the main proteins obtained from living organisms such as transforming bacteria The main diseases which are treated with proteins are diabetes  hemophilia  infectious diseases  and anemia 
These therapeutic proteins are primarily hormones  interleukins  anticoagulants  and enzymes  which are recombinant proteins 
Other protein drugs  such as calcitonin  rituximab  gemtuzumab  insulin  epidermal growth factor  and interferons  are best known for their importance in the treatment of osteoporosis  lymphoma  leukemia  and diabetes mellitus   The most employed biological protein therapy is immunotherapy  which has several applications 
One of the most important applications is cancer treatment  which is a specific treatment that employs cytokines  a kind of protein produced by the immunity system that helps the patient s immune system eliminate cancer cells and prevents the replication of cancer cells 
These immune proteins are classified in therapeutic groups known as cytokines  monoclonal antibodies  tyrosine kinase inhibitor  and rapamycin receptor inhibitors in mammals  mTOR    
Two main kinds of cytokines are the most importantly used in biological therapies  interleukins and interferons 
Production is carried out with laboratory animals and once extracted and purified  they are used by injection into a human recipient for clinical treatment  e g  monoclonal antibodies 
However  there are many applications for products  such as antibodies obtained from live organisms and these are used mainly for the prevention of diseases such as in the development of vaccines 
The most important pharmaceutical products are listed in Table     Each one of these peptides or proteins has a different method of administration  such as intravenous  oral  topical  or intravesical 
Some other proposed methods of administration that would avoid the difficulties of the route of administration and offer comfort to the user include the nasal  pulmonary  ocular  and rectal routes    which could be as invasive as the traditional routes in many cases 
The main drawback of this type of therapies is that traditional administration such as subcutaneous injection and intravenous administration can modify their effectiveness  since the route of administration may vary in different clinical circumstances  for example  it may contribute to an increase in blood pressure   When any substance  including proteins  enters the bloodstream regardless of the route of administration  these proteins are exposed to many environmental threats such as sequestration by the reticuloendothelial system mainly for macrophage internalization  enzymatic degradation and absorption and elimination of serum proteins by the liver  –   which is an important factor to consider  since it represents a low efficiency in the application of biological therapy due to its high rate of degradation and elimination   
In addition to protecting the lability of all therapeutic proteins  it is also about preventing them from exerting their activity in places that do not require it 
Although immunotherapy is more effective and less toxic than therapies made with chemical molecules  these immune proteins also trigger adverse effects in the host  such as autoimmunities and non specific inflammatory processes   
For these reasons  research is being carried out on the use of alternative technologies with which these side effects can be controlled  such as with the use of nanotechnology using polymers  with which these proteins can be protected  favoring their transport and direct delivery to their objective  preventing them from exerting their toxic effect on non specific cells and sites   Nanocarriers  such as nanotubes    microneedles  MNs   –   fusion peptide carriers    or peptide conjugated nanoparticles  NPs      are some of the main carriers and protective systems used in immunotherapy  regardless of the size or structure of the molecule to be transported and protected  which could be genetic material  interferon  interleukins  or antibodies In   the US FDA approved the use of TDD systems and their use has been increasing in relevance for protein drugs because for some molecules these delivery systems improve the solubility of the compound  in addition to allowing it to pass efficiently through the skin There are important findings in research revealing that TDD technologies allow the loading  transport  and release of protein drugs 
They are very promising for the effective treatment of local cancers  with skin location  and they have a second benefit of activating the immune system from a remote distance 
Some of them have been developed to carry ribonucleic acid  RNA  that can regulate localized gene expression within a known target 
In other cases  it is possible to use an immunologic protein that could produce a strong adaptive immune response against a specific antigen in the case of vaccines  where it could be made with the tumor antigen expressed in the gene  tumor related protein or peptide  specific epitope  or cell lysate   For immunotherapy  it might be possible to employ monoclonal antibody loaded TDD systems and tumor agnostic therapies  non specific immunotherapies  use of interferons and interleukins  and cancer theranostic treatment where SC could be interrupted by a nanogel delivering a drug through the skin and allowing it to accumulate at the tumor site   or these systems may even function by delivering vaccine antigens  cancer vaccines  using nanoparticles and liposomes as antigenic carriers loaded on nanogels to pass the antigen through the SC by iontophoresis   
It is also possible to use microneedles loaded with Dermatophagoides farinae extract to achieve effective allergen release and effective immune response induction   These strategies have a wide range of application in various skin pathological circumstances  in addition to their main role in cancer therapy  and many products are used for the treatment of cancer 
Some of the commercial pharmaceutical products used for cancer therapy  which are administered transdermally  are described in Table     Through the use of transdermal delivery systems  it is sought to increase the solubility and stability  the circulating life  and the pharmacokinetic properties of drug proteins and peptides 
It is recommended to consider that the TDD system is not applicable to many of the biomolecules that are used as medical treatments since the success in the transdermal passage could depend on certain factors 
The efficacy of this therapeutic system depends both on the physical and chemical properties of the proteins and on the percutaneous administration systems of biomolecules to be used 
Regarding protein  the main physical properties to consider are the shape and size  molecular weight  solubility  and amphoteric nature  the latter being perhaps one of the most important to consider since due to its amphoteric property it can migrate in an electric field and its migration direction depends on the net charge that it has 
The knowledge of this property could help to elucidate which are the best percutaneous administration systems to facilitate passage through the SC 
In the case of charged proteins  physical  electrical  enhancers are the best option to use 
The chemical nature of proteins is another especially important factor to know 
This composition could help us to choose the best TDD system through which the protein will pass through the SC avoiding the reactivity of some functional groups of proteins 
For these reasons  there is little increase in the development of new therapeutic formulations administered by TDD systems  since there are some protein properties that need to be studied and analyzed to know if they can be administered by this route without affecting its stability and pharmacokinetic properties Peptides are molecules that have a molecular weight between   Da and   kDa 
This molecular weight depends on the molecular structures and their lengths with a small amount of amino acids or constitutes a protein with a complex structure 
These molecules are charged in a physiological pH and are hydrophilic  which complicates their permeability across the skin 
Some drugs have a lower or higher affinity with the lipophilic condition of the SC  which determines the quantity of the molecule that can cross this layer of the skin naturally 
Therefore  it is better to use a technique that improves passage to the skin  using or not natural permeation molecular routes avoiding the degradation of peptides or proteins and ensuring passage and integrity during the transport and release processes   There are important skin conditions that can change permeability  such as age  heat  racial differences  freezing  abrasion  chemical irritant activity  and some diseases such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis 
It is very important to recognize these for the development and use of devices employed in transdermal protein drug delivery In the skin  three molecular permeation routes are the most important  intracellular  intercellular  and follicular routes 
All of these are beneficiated by the concentration gradient of the molecules present in the milieu  allowing passive diffusion across the SC   
Moreover  physicochemical properties from the molecule affect its passage through the SC 
Hydrophobic molecules can cross the SC intercellularly  whereas hydrophilic molecules cross intracellularly by corneocytes 
Passage through the skin can take place through so called cutaneous defects  in which the skin has a discontinuity  such as sweat glands or hair shafts   In the skin  the SC and lipid layers have a barrier function  as both prevent the loss of water and avoid the entry of any substances  molecules  or microorganisms from the environment or microbiome 
These layers play a crucial role in the passive passage of proteins and other chemicals into the skin 
The liquid flux between the lipid layer depends on the lamellar and linear lipid matrix arrangement 
The lamellar layer is generally oriented parallel to the SC  and linear lipids are perpendicular to the SC 
If no long periodicity phase  LPP  exists  the permeability increases   
However  if the orthorhombic phase  OP  predominates  the permeability of the lipids is reduced  and if the OP predominates in the lateral layer  the permeation decreases   
The LPP is primarily formed by ceramides  cholesterol  and free fatty acids  and these have a unique tri layer organization  while an all trans chain lipid organization exists in the OP phase  which has a rectangular crystalline lattice and no mobility Transdermal drug delivery has been used for many years  and the skin was thought to be impervious to exogenous chemical molecules 
Currently  it is known that the skin is a semi permeable barrier  which allows its use as a transport route for molecules  allowing the molecule to reach the therapeutic target intact 
However  due to its anatomy  hydrophilic molecules can only pass through the skin if they are small  and even then  in many cases  they require help from an electric field  electrotherapies  as in the case of electroporation   and iontophoresis   
These techniques use a low voltage supplementation  direct current  around the drug site  allowing and enhancing passage through the skin   
When an electric field is applied to the skin  a large molecular movement occurs and the molecule can take the path of the hair follicle through the skin or induce pore formation     There is another technology using acoustic transmission  sonophoresis  that is used in medical trials  such as hyperthermia treatment  physical therapy  and ultrasonic surgery  which has the ability to facilitate drug transport to the skin   
Through this technique  mechanical waves of medium or low frequency are transferred to a physical medium  such as a specific gel  which allows it to propagate and transmit energy 
In the ultrasonic system  wave sounds have an oscillation frequency greater than   kHz   The TDD systems are an alternative route that allows the control of the drug release and decreases the possibility of any side effects associated with levels that are higher than the minimum pharmacological concentration  reducing pharmacological dosing times because a patch is administered every   to   h  This eliminates the risk of metabolism of the therapeutic agent and the loss of the available dose 
In addition  there are other advantages  such as the noninvasive drug delivery method  which can be discontinued at any time   
To facilitate TDD to improve SC permeation  some technologies improve drug flux of difficult drugs    such as cryioneumatic and photpneumatic technologies  sonphoresis  iontophoresis  electroporation  jet injection  and MN  which are used in the delivery of many drugs   The disadvantage in the above cases is that all devices require a low voltage supplement 
In addition  it is necessary to purchase equipment to manage the electrical current 
In addition  in some people it can cause sensitivity  such as tingling and irritation  and the technique can even cause blistering of the skin 
In these cases  when the technique is not well applied  it can cause burns to the skin 
In all circumstances  these techniques must be applied by trained personnel Despite these drawbacks  considerable research has been focused on the transport of peptides through the skin with good results 
In Table   we list some examples of these studies  the biomolecules and penetration enhancers  and the main result of each 
The table also indicates whether the physical penetration enhancer acts alone or is enhanced by a combination with another enhancer or nanocarrier    –  Many compounds have been employed to improve the penetration of substances across the skin  such as azone  pyrrolidones  alkanols  sulfoxides  glycols  alcohols  and surfactants   
Each of the chemical penetration enhancers has a specific action mechanism in the skin penetration process Due to the characteristics of the upper layer of the skin  which is specialized in avoiding and preventing the entry of any molecule or pathogen  the SC is complicated in terms of the passage of molecules greater than   Da  but it is not impossible 
In many cases  this process can be carried out using penetration enhancer molecules  which have good results in terms of penetration of molecules through the skin 
However  it represents a disadvantage because it could permit not only pathogens but also microorganisms in the cutaneous microbiota to enter as a consequence of cellular disruption integrity and the focal detachment of superficial corneocytes  such as in the use of thioglycolate in depilatory treatments   
The process of percutaneous absorption of a therapeutic molecule consists of several processes  which include the dissolution and release of the therapeutic agent  partition and diffusion within the SC  partition from the SC to the aqueous phase of the epidermis and its diffusion  and finally  access to the systemic circulation and target tissue There are three routes through which any molecule can breach this and reach the microcirculation through the tissue 
These are the intercellular  transcellular  and transappendageal routes  but the route can depend on the drug s molecular weight  Fig 
    Chemical penetration enhancers are a good alternative to allow the passage of biomolecules  but most of them cause skin irritation  which is uncomfortable for patients   
In many cases  the penetration enhancers have synergic activity when they are used in combination    but they can generate more skin irritation problems 
The mode of action of these enhancers is different for each one and depends on the mechanism by which it interacts with the compounds of the SC 
Due to this capacity  it has been classified according to their interaction ability in those that  a  interact with lipid heads within aqueous domains of the lipid bilayers and interact with the lipid alkyl chain   b  interact with actin filaments in the corneocytes   c  allow partitioning augmentation and increase drug protein solubility in the SC  and  d  improve penetration indirectly  modifying the drug  Fig 
    
Some of the most studied chemical penetration enhancers are the terpenes  amide  fatty acids  monoglycerides  and surfactants  and some of the most commonly studied are  D limonene  azone  lauric acid  monoolein and sodium lauryl sulfate   Depending on their chemical structure  some polymers can transport drug molecules within their structure  as in the case of cyclodextrins and their derivatives together with other saccharides  moieties  that can transport drugs as ketoprofen   or biomolecules such as levothyroxine sodium  T  which has been used as a topical treatment to eliminate lipid deposits in subcutaneous adipose tissue 
The main problem with this type of application has been the IT  detection in rabbits   h after the application of the cream 
The use of dimethyl cyclodextrin as a solubilizer for levothyroxine increased its solubility  but unfortunately  it only succeeded in penetrating much less levothyroxine through the skin than the required dose in humans   
In this way  it is important to highlight that the complex improves the solubility of the molecule allowing it to pass through the SC  and in another specific treatment  it could recognize a specific target in the cell plasma membrane and then adhere to it and release its content in a more efficient way Proteins are a substantial problem when we try to pass them through the skin 
First  they are larger  and second  they are highly susceptible to enzymatic degradation 
Not all are thermostable  and finally  another difficulty is that proteins and peptides live for a short time in plasma 
For this  it is necessary to protect them during their trip to the place of action 
Furthermore  this protection enables controlled delivery 
Passing through the skin can be less difficult if the protein is in a capsule  which is best when the capsule size is in the nanometric range Advances in the science of polymers applied in pharmacy have allowed the development of many encapsulation techniques that range from the most impractical to the most revolutionary methods 
However  this reveals a problem  as some polymers are not soluble in water and require organic solvents 
Furthermore  the integrity of the protein to be encapsulated is compromised regardless of the encapsulation technique Many types of polymers could be used in drug delivery  however  their chemical structure and molecular weight do not allow dissolution in water in many cases  and most dissolve well in organic solvents 
The solubility of the polymer is a characteristic that is important to determine before use because it can determine the environmental resistance in the process in which it will be used Biopolymers and their combinations are best used for these procedures  helping to improve the stability of the formulation as in the case of encapsulating transforming growth factor  TGF β  in poly d l lactic co glycolic acid   PLGA  and polyethylene glycol  PEG  polymeric microparticles for bone regeneration   
Insulin loaded PCL PEG PCL NPs are another example where the NPs were prepared by the w o w double emulsion solvent evaporation method and demonstrated satisfactory insulin delivery and efficacy in treating diabetic rats   
These NPs possess a specific protein drug delivery with a delivery degradation speed 
They are hydrophobic or hydrophilic according to what is necessary for the encapsulation procedure and for improvement in the stability of the protein drug 
They have a low or no chance of rejection and are safe to use Encapsulation processes are classified into two types  chemical and mechanical  which are then classified according to the methodology used to make the capsule 
This can be determined according to the desired size  shape  and composition surface chemistry 
The encapsulation of biomolecules by these methods allows us to avoid the degradation of the free protein and allows the prolonged and constant release of a protein drug in constant time     With these methods  it is possible to obtain nano sized particles  which are especially important to avoid their elimination by the immune system and the liver   
Smaller and softer particles can better evade the immune system  and this can be compatible with the recipient organism 
It is important to note that capsules with a diameter size of ≤  μm have the risk of being engulfed by phagocytic immune cells  therefore  the recommended NP size that could have an appropriate delivery range is   to   nm   Dendrimers are three dimensional NPs  like macromolecules  and are considered based on nanometric size 
These are radially symmetric and comprise an inner core structure made up of a central atom covalently bonded between other atoms 
The external composition is highly branched  forming a dendrimer structure 
These branches allow the formation of cavities into which bioactive molecules   can be incorporated  such as proteins   and peptides used for many pathological treatments   and for storage  transport  and controlled delivery There are many types of dendrimer structures  and depending on the synthesis method  these methods could use click chemistry   and divergent and convergent strategies 
In addition  there are different designs and chemical elements 
Their application in the administration of drugs has focused on the fact that these have many biocompatible characteristics 
These characteristics include non immunogenicity  non toxicity  and a high ability to cross biological barriers  such as cell membranes  blood vessels  intestines  and the blood brain barrier   In addition  they have high stability in blood circulation and a prolonged blood circulation half life  and they target specific structures 
These NPs can be manufactured in high purity and have some degree of in vitro toxicity when manufactured with cationic and anionic surface groups 
However  it is possible to reduce this toxicity by using surface protection by PEGs or fatty acids   In TDD systems  dendrimers have been employed for the penetration of nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs  such as indomethacin  which is an arthritis and osteoarthritis auxiliary drug in the treatment of the pain generated from this disease 
There is a study that reports the progress of the TAT PAMAM dendrimer system developed as a non viral vector for the transdermal release of DNA plasmids where the dendrimer system was modified 
The HIV transcriptional transactivator  TAT  was conjugated as a cell penetrating peptide to enhance the uptake of constructed plasmid DNA pIRES H GFP by cells   
Dendrimers are an excellent drug penetration enhancer   and they are some of the best nanostructures that have high applicability in medicine for the delivery of peptides and proteins As mentioned  traditional routes  intradermal  gastric  or intravenous  have long been the main delivery route for all drugs 
Nevertheless  the appearance of an increase in chronic diseases has allowed the development of new technologies that are less invasive and have high efficiency upon reaching the target  especially in cases in which a user must take more than one medicine for the treatment of one or more diseases at a time Although the design and use of MNs can ensure the entrance of molecules across the skin  biomolecules have a high degradation risk that can occur at any time  in the charging process or at the moment of release 
Thus  it is better to protect the protein contained within a specialized structure  such as nanocapsules or dendrimers  NPs in both cases 
This procedure has no danger for the protein or peptide structural composition  which improves the conservation and passage of these compositions across the SC  Fig 
 The PLGA NPs can go through SC better with the help of MNs because the micro conduits created by these needles allow the NPs to avoid the SC barrier and arrive at other skin layers and deliver the complete contents  Fig 
    
For this procedure  it is necessary to consider that  in all cases  the penetration capacity of NPs depends on the particle and channel size   
Despite this important consideration  among others  the procedure also avoids the limitations of the skin s physicochemical properties that do not permit crossing it Some experimental studies have demonstrated the penetration and distribution of PLGA NPs in MNs   
The most common use of NPs MNs is for experimental insulin release systems using murine models in rats with induced diabetes  where the insulin is introduced into H O responsive mesoporous silica NPs  and MN patches are manufactured for later transdermal application 
Its release behavior analysis demonstrated effective release   
For immunity induction  an excellent response occurs when the NPs MNs were employed 
For example  for the induction of immunity against endogenous prostate cancer stem cell antigen RALA pPSCA  the immunization via the NP MN release system resulted in anti tumor activity in both cases of prophylactic and treatment assays in vivo   
Another experimental process that allows probing the system efficacy is the use of poly methylmethacrylate  coated with   nm of gold NPs  which has great potential in tumoral cell destruction   Currently  there are few authorized devices  however  these are increasing because for many treatments  such devices are more appropriately used  effective  and exhibit more recommended results 
Perhaps shortly  these devices will be the most appropriate techniques for drug and protein delivery systems For many decades  a great number of therapies to resolve the problems associated with drug release have been implicated to probe numerous kinds of devices and pharmaceutical innovations to solve many diseases or applications in various clinical trials for the diagnosis of diseases or treatments of diseases 
For this application  it is necessary to design new technologies  and pharmaceutical chemistry has been concerned with offering the best administration methods for therapeutic agents Lately  many research studies have reported numerous results that indicate the most appropriate technologies to use in each case of a drug delivery system 
Each of the aforementioned TDD systems has some advantages and disadvantages for use in administering protein drug delivery However  these technologies create substantial and important opportunities for administering biomolecules 
In the coming years  we will observe an increase in their design  development  characterization  and clinical trials for the treatment of many important and chronic diseases SARS CoV  recruits a haem metabolite to evade antibody immunityDNA fragments encoding SARS CoV  S   Uniprot ID  P DTC  residues  –  NTD  –  RBD  –  SARS CoV  S   Uniprot ID  P  residues  –  HCoV NL   Uniprot ID  Q Q S  residues  –  HCoV OC   isolate LRTI  NCBI accession code KX  residues  –  were codon optimised for expression in human cells and cloned into pQ C xStrep vector   under control of the cytomegalovirus  CMV  promoter for production of the recombinant proteins carrying a C terminal extension containing human rhinovirus    C protease recognition site followed by a TwinStrep tag

The vector for production of the His tagged stabilised trimeric SARS CoV  has been described  
Expression constructs encoding heavy and light chains of P  Fab were made by inserting the respective coding sequences into pHLsec   including a sequence encoding a hexa histidine  His  tag on the heavy chain fragment C terminus With exception of trimeric stabilized SARS CoV  spike ectodomain  the proteins were produced by transient transfection of Expi   Thermo Fisher Scientific  cells with endotoxin free preparations of the corresponding DNA constructs using ExpiFectamine   Thermo Fisher Scientific 
The cells were maintained in shake flasks in FreeStyle   Thermo Fisher Scientific  medium at  °C in humidified   CO  atmosphere 
To produce SARS CoV  S  NTD fragment for crystallography  cell culture medium was supplemented with   μM kifunensine  Sigma Aldrich  to suppress complex glycosylation

Measurements were performed in duplicate The importance of feedback for surgical teams during the COVID  pandemic
Editor
As new research has emerged about COVID  transmission  personal protective equipment  PPE  and patient management guidelines have evolved 
This has led to rapid guideline changes within healthcare systems 
Conflicting guidelines can contribute to miscommunication  increased stress  and reduced cohesion among surgical teams 
To successfully implement new guidelines during times of crisis  specific and timely feedback can be used to identify and resolve breaches in infection control  and promote feelings of support among healthcare workers Although inherently less complex than live surgery  feedback in stressful simulated scenarios can provide information about common pitfalls and provide a safe environment in which to practice new skills 
Our group found that when under stress  mental practice coaching combined with feedback significantly enhanced performance compared to simulation alone by better preparing individuals to execute action 
Feedback and mental rehearsal can help improve individuals  knowledge of guidelines and confidence in their abilities to perform under stress 
Critical skills to master in this new environment include PPE donning and doffing  performing procedures on COVID positive patients while in PPE  and new workflow protocols Within normal workflow  new technical skills and adherence to new operative safety protocols may be improved by video based feedback 
In a randomized study  coached trainees using video feedback made approximately half the number of technical errors when compared with those receiving conventional training 
This coaching has been extremely well received when implemented in multidisciplinary teams 
Non technical performance can also be improved through structured curricula combined with debriefing and feedback Under the best of circumstances  it can be challenging to provide the feedback necessary to maintain and improve individual and team performance 
Our team developed the operating room  OR  Black Box®  Surgical Safety Technologies  Inc    a technology that continuously captures and synchronizes multiple sources of intraoperative video and audio data 
Postoperatively  analysts identify safety threats and resilience supports that may respectively contribute to  or help to avoid adverse events  so targeted interventions can be implemented to promote patient safety 
Over the last ten years  our group has researched effective ways to reduce surgical error and optimize surgical safety using feedback – To address the need for feedback during the COVID pandemic at our institution  we developed the COVID Black Box 
Data from simulation scenarios on COVID positive patients recorded via the COVID Black Box is assessed to detect breaches in infection control practices  and identify suboptimal performance for improvement 
Specific and timely feedback is provided to equip OR personnel on how to correct misinformation  improve responses  and facilitate behavioural change on an operative team level 
Although formal analysis has yet to be conducted  qualitative downstream effects of feedback observed include an increased sense of control  reduced stress  improved team communication  feelings of managerial support  and more positive attitudes indicative of the organizational safety culture During this global pandemic  hospitals and surgical departments should not underestimate the importance of providing their teams with feedback 
Hospitals without comprehensive recording capabilities should establish systematic methods of providing feedback to OR teams such as video recording operations or assigning dedicated observers to record breaches in safety practices 
This feedback should be presented to surgical teams immediately and continuously  and collated for the larger institution on a regular basis to transparently communicate lessons learned from previous surgical cases 
Specific and timely feedback may reduce preventable errors in surgery during the pressures of the pandemic 
With ongoing effort to support our surgical teams and better performance  we can help our front line OR staff and patients during both the first  and subsequent waves of this pandemic The Global COVID‐  Observatory and Resource Center for Childhood Cancer  A response for the pediatric oncology community by SIOP and St  Jude GlobalAfter rapidly spreading across the globe  COVID‐  officially became a pandemic on March    
 
 Initial reports suggested that patients with comorbidities were at higher risk  causing concern that children with cancer were at risk of developing severe infection 
 
 Furthermore  measures to mitigate the spread of the virus  such as delaying medical procedures and travel restrictions  were anticipated to disturb the continuity of pediatric cancer care 
 
 It was also anticipated that the effects of the pandemic on health systems would amplify existing obstacles to caring for children with cancer 
 

Since the beginning of the pandemic  a deluge of information regarding disease characteristics and possible management strategies was disseminated 
This infodemic  an overabundance of information during an epidemic 
 
 has posed challenges never encountered before and was an early concern 
 
 The rapid spread of information and misinformation  potentiated by social media platforms  presented a public health challenge  confusing and overwhelming healthcare professionals and lay public alike In response to the need for a trusted resource with curated  reliable information and a platform to share experiences for the pediatric oncology community  the International Society of Pediatric Oncology  SIOP  and St  Jude Children s Research Hospital  SJCRH  created the Global COVID‐  Observatory and Resource Center for Childhood Cancer  GCORCCC 
The GCORCCC was launched as an open‐access website  covid childhoodcancer org  on April    The Resource Library contains updated curated peer‐reviewed manuscripts  guidance documents  and links relevant to the multidisciplinary care of children with cancer during COVID‐ 
 
 Publications are reviewed and assessed for relevance weekly for inclusion 
 
 We prioritize the dissemination of accurate data and quickly identify and address misinformation or conflicting reports 
Only peer‐reviewed articles are included  as unvetted scientific information  such as preprints  were identified as a risk for misinformation for providers 
 
  
 

The sections of the Resource Library are as follows  COVID‐  and Pediatric Oncology  General COVID‐  Information  Treatment  Prevention  For Healthcare Providers  and For Patients and Families 
Each section provides a collection of publications  guidance documents  recorded webinars  and relevant links To address the needs of healthcare professionals during this unprecedented time  resources focusing on leadership  self‐care  and resiliency are also included in the Resource Library 
Additionally  a subsection specifically aimed at nurses  with literature and guidance documents  was developed 
The Pediatric Oncology Nursing during COVID‐  Fact Sheet summarizes the most relevant guidance for caring for children with cancer and is available in six languages as a quick bedside reference 
Finally  a section with resources for patients and families aids bedside providers in educating and navigating patients and families toward trusted  accurate sources of information At the beginning of the pandemic  the natural history of COVID‐  in children and adolescents with cancer was unknown 
To gain an accurate picture of the burden of COVID‐  among this patient population  we developed the Global COVID‐  Registry 
Healthcare providers worldwide were invited to voluntarily report any patient  under   years of age  with a malignancy or history of hematopoietic stem cell transplant at the time of a laboratory‐confirmed SARS‐CoV‐  infection 
The Registry was approved by the SJCRH Institutional Review Board As of December      cases from   countries have been reported 
Using aggregate data  we created an interactive data visualization dashboard to provide updates in a dynamic format  Figure  
The data visualization allows providers to filter cases by variables such as underlying diagnosis  cancer treatment  and COVID‐  outcomes Creating an opportunity to bring the global community of healthcare professionals together is an essential component of the GCORCCC 
The Collaboration Space provides a forum for healthcare professionals to interact and share their experiences and questions about caring for children with cancer during the COVID‐  pandemic 
The Collaboration Space has language translation capabilities  making it accessible to a large number of providers globally 
Here  users are also able to access content  such as videos  blog posts  and live events Through sharing experiences  providers can support and learn from each other 
From the Frontlines is a blog series published to highlight unique accounts of childhood cancer providers navigating COVID‐  around the world 
To date  the blog features stories from   providers in   countries 
These providers discuss the challenges their teams have faced and innovative solutions they have employed to continue to treat children with cancer during the pandemic 
Currently  there are   total active users registered in the Collaboration Space who have connected and interacted over   times with content elements A rapidly evolving pandemic poses many challenges in caring for children with cancer 
The GCORCCC established a mechanism to generate and transfer knowledge for the pediatric oncology community during a global pandemic and infodemic 
Through its various elements  users can access relevant information to help them adapt and respond to the rapidly shifting situation Academic institutions and professional societies should play central roles in the accurate and timely dissemination of information 
For professionals caring for children with cancer  the sharing of experiences from regions that were affected early in the pandemic was essential for formulating the initial responses to the evolving pandemic 
 
  
 
  
 
In addition  guidance for the management of COVID‐  for different patient populations was generated by government agencies and professional societies with remarkable speed 
 
  
 
  
 
Importantly  information sufficiency has been linked to less stress and worry amongst health care professionals 
 
 For this reason  a resource like the GCORCCC can support individuals to decrease burn out and improve resilience 
This effort brought colleagues together and facilitated a sense of community in these trying times  in an innovative approach to addressing global challenges in pediatric cancer care 
Many organizations attempted to compile listing of resources that are relevant to their specific populations  but few of them also sought to create knowledge about COVID‐  in their populations to add to the evidence‐based literature At a time of exceptionally high stakes for children with cancer  the multi‐stakeholder collaboration that led to the GCORCCC represents a framework for global cooperative efforts in the future 
SIOP and SJCRH formed a partnership aimed at disseminating the GCORCCC widely and rapidly throughout the global network  leveraging the strengths of both organizations 
This platform shows that novel  dynamic information resources can help provide guidance to frontline providers across the globe  facilitating the rapid sharing and adoption of new information in highly dynamic situations 
The collaborations built through this rapid multidisciplinary implementation and global dissemination process provide a foundation upon which the global community can collectively build to ultimately improve outcomes for all children with cancer everywhere In memoriam  This manuscript is dedicated to Dr  Arturo Moreno  past president of SLAOP SIOP Latin America  a tireless advocate for children with cancer in Mexico  Latin America  and the world The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest The Psychodynamic Approach During COVID  Emotional CrisisThe health emergency we are experiencing due to COVID  has strongly influenced not only physical health but also the mental health of the general population as well as collective behavior  Gray et al    Orrù et al   b  Lenzo et al   
The understanding of mental health consequences must consider individual emotional responses associated with the ongoing stressful experience of the COVID  pandemic  Di Giuseppe et al   a  Venuleo et al   
Negative emotions such as fear  anger  frustration and significant economic worries are associated with higher levels of anxiety  depression  sleep disturbances  maladaptive behaviors  and psychosomatic symptoms  Conversano et al   b  Franceschini et al    Parola et al   
As expected  the severity of clinical conditions is observed to be higher in vulnerable groups such as children  the elderly  psychiatric patients  and front line workers  Aafjes van Doorn et al   b  Elbay et al    Elkholy et al    Merlo et al    Shen et al    Singh et al    Orrù et al   
Research has demonstrated that emotion regulation plays a key role in stress management and adaptation helping the individual to cope with discharged feelings and thoughts related to the COVID  crisis  communication of the final stage of the individual s life  Iasevoli et al    and  therefore  protecting them from developing clinical levels of psychological distress  Di Giuseppe et al   e  Prout et al    Walker and McCabe   
The role of dynamic psychotherapy is essential in moderating people s emotional reactions  although its implementation requires the adjustment of therapeutic strategies enhancing adaptation and resilience  Aafjes van Doorn et al   a  Békés et al   
From this perspective  it is imperative to improve public awareness and establish adequate procedures and prompt responses of intervention Due to uncertainty surrounding COVID  collective distress and individual suffering  the psychodynamic approach may be able to consistently identify and manage stressful life event dynamics  Afari et al    Di Giuseppe et al   a  as well as fostering emotional regulation in order to prevent possible relevant factors involved in the pathogenesis of both psychological and psychosomatic syndromes  Lenzo et al    Martino et al   a b  Conversano and Di Giuseppe    Sardella et al   
This is of particular relevance at present with many experiencing grief and sorrow for the loss of a family member  a reduction of freedom  changes in daily routines and fears associated with uncertainty and the intolerance of uncertainty  Conversano et al   a  Orrù et al   a 
In response to these stressors  the individual activates unconscious defense mechanisms  psychological strategies that help in reducing the anxiety associated with the awareness of internal conflicts and externally charged situations  Perry    American Psychiatric Association   
Since defense mechanisms are hierarchically organized and own specific psychological functions  they may cause a wide number of negative consequences as well as playing a significant role as protective factors against psychological distress and psychopathological symptoms caused by the COVID  outbreak  Marazziti et al   
The use of high adaptive defense mechanisms promotes increased awareness of one owns feelings related to difficult life experiences and leads to better adjustment and resilience  whereas the use of immature defenses protects the self from painful feelings and thoughts at the cost of developing maladaptive affective  cognitive and relational disfunctions  Di Giuseppe et al    Perry et al   
Recent studies demonstrate that specific therapeutic intervention may increase the overall defensive maturity and improve psychological well being and adjustment  Hoffman et al    Prout et al   b    Di Giuseppe et al   d In this opinion article the relevance of the implementing psychodynamic approach in the prevention of individuals  mental health during the ongoing COVID  crisis has been highlighted 
In accordance with Marčinko et al 
  the inclusion of psychodynamic interventions within the public mental health emergency system is recommended  considered as an effective strategy in reinforcing the individual s well being both during and after the COVID  pandemic crisis 
The application of specific therapeutic interventions derived from the psychodynamic approach can enhance emotion regulation and adaptive responses as the COVID  pandemic progresses Understanding how the ongoing pandemic is influencing human reactions to such a stressful event is essential for developing ad hoc effective interventions 
The systematic assessment of unconscious psychological aspects of personality should be promoted for the early detection of vulnerable individuals and for improving research and clinical practice toward a personalized therapeutic approach  Lingiardi and McWilliams    Lingiardi et al    Tanzilli et al    Barber and Solomonov    Talia et al    Di Giuseppe et al   c  Zilcha Mano and Ramseyer   The author confirms being the sole contributor to this work and approves it for publication The author declares that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest Coping with COVID  An Examination of the Role of  Non Religiousness Non SpiritualityThe COVID  pandemic represents a global collective trauma event  Duane et al 
  and is among the first such events to disrupt and compromise the physical and emotional safety and lives of all United States  U S  Americans in the contemporary era 
Due to the novel nature of the current pandemic and diverse challenges  e g  social isolation  economic hardship  mental and physical health  grief  the utility of commonly employed coping strategies is unknown 
In general  adaptive coping strategies are associated with positive outcomes  whereas maladaptive coping strategies are associated with distress  Lazarus et al 
 
However  extant literature exploring coping strategies used in response to large scale disasters often emphasizes the utility of religious and spiritual coping  in particular  Aten et al 
  and excludes nonreligious and or nonspiritual people  Hwang et al 
 
Such studies may erroneously infer that nonreligious nonspiritual people are detrimentally impacted by the absence of religious spiritual  R S  coping despite their omission from participation 
In fact  little is known about the manner by which nonreligious and nonspiritual people cope with large scale events with the potential for individual and collective trauma  an omission the current study sought to address Collective traumas are events that disrupt daily life for an entire community and include natural and human caused disasters  Erickson   Silver et al 
  as well as sociopolitical oppressions  Comas Díaz et al 
  Kelly et al 
 
These shared traumatic events often deteriorate the sense of safety and security of those affected  Silver et al 
  and have negative psychological consequences  Goldmann et al 
  Luszczynska et al 
 
Though destruction and disruption often remain following such disasters  pandemics  including the COVID  pandemic  differ from other natural  e g  weather related  and human made  e g  mass shootings  disasters in the sustained nature of the event itself Symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder  PTSD  including depressive and anxious symptoms  are possible in response to collective trauma  Goldmann et al 
  but vary in prevalence  Bonanno   Neria et al 
 
Many factors other than the traumatic event likely influence the presentation of psychological symptoms  including disruption distress  social support and coping  Baral et al 
 
Survivors of the SARS pandemic in Hong Kong and Taiwan reported trauma related and other psychological symptoms including hopelessness  alienation and long term changes to mental and physical health 
Similar to COVID  in addition to illness and death  social and economic disruption accompanied SARS  Lei et al 
 
Though previous exposure to such collective trauma events likely increases resilience to future traumatic events  Bonanno et al 
  the U S  has not been significantly disrupted by a similar pandemic  e g  requiring physical distancing  face coverings  hand hygiene  widespread disruptions to schooling and employment  in over   years 
Therefore  US residents may experience more psychological consequences and possess fewer coping resources than people living in countries significantly impacted by recent  similar pandemics Coping refers to use of processes aimed at reducing  tolerating  or mastering stress 
In general  Lazarus et al 
  in response to natural and human made disasters  Cherry et al 
  Shing et al 
  and in the face of other global health crises like HIV AIDS  Blashill et al 
  emotion focused  e g  acceptance  positive reframing  and problem focused  e g  instrumental support  planning  coping  or adaptive coping strategies  are more effective than strategies categorized as dysfunctional or maladaptive  e g  denial  venting  substance use 
Further  the nature of the traumatic event may influence the effectiveness of coping strategies such that temporary losses may benefit from different techniques as compared to more permanent losses or changes  Shing et al 
 In a study of over   adults in Spain during a country wide COVID  lockdown    of participants reported anxious or depressive symptoms 
Lower levels of anxious and or depressive symptoms were associated with maintaining a healthy diet  avoiding news updates related to COVID  talking with friends and relatives  pursuing hobbies  spending time outdoors and following a routine  Fullana et al 
 
In April   in the U S  a national sample recruited online via MTurk reported most commonly using distraction  active coping and social support in response to COVID 
Of note  woman identified participants were more likely to use multiple emotion focused strategies  including religious support  whereas participants who were young  financially insecure  or identified as a sexual minority were more likely to engage in maladaptive strategies including disengagement and substance use  as well as humor  an adaptive coping strategy  Park et al 
 Though the potential benefits of religious and or spiritual identification and engagement for well being are well documented  Paloutzian et al 
  the absence of religious and or spiritual belief is not necessarily associated with low levels of well being  or poor adjustment following traumatic events 
Rather  the coherency hypothesis suggests the ability to make sense of the world  in whatever way fits for a person  is associated with well being 
Among nonreligious and nonspiritual people in Canada  engagement in religiousness  spirituality  and related practices  e g  meditation  church attendance  ranged from not associated to negatively associated with mental health  such that higher R S among nonreligious and nonspiritual participants was related to lower well being  Speed et al 
 
Therefore  it is more accurate to suggest religious and spiritual engagement  e g  prayer  church attendance  is generally beneficial for the health of those with religious and spiritual beliefs and values  Speed et al 
  but not a necessary condition of health for all people 
Galen et al 
  for example  found evidence of a curvilinear relationship between  non religiousness and well being  such that those with high levels of religiousness spirituality as well as those with high levels of nonreligiousness nonspirituality reported higher well being as compared to those with medium or low levels of  non religiousness non spirituality 
However  scant literature has explored the implications of this curvilinear relationship for mental health and well being in response to specific traumatic events  e g  natural disasters  pandemics The authors  Abbott et al 
  examined the mediating role of coping strategies in the relationship between trauma intensity and posttraumatic symptoms and growth  as moderated by  non religiousness non spirituality following a natural disaster in a small  rural city in the Southeastern U S 
Consistent with previous research  lower levels of depressive symptoms and higher posttraumatic growth were associated with higher institutional religiousness and individual spirituality 
However  upon probing an interaction between trauma and non religion non spirituality  nonreligious and nonspiritual participants reported lower depressive symptoms and more posttraumatic growth when employing adaptive coping strategies  specifically problem focused coping  e g  active coping  instrumental support and planning  Abbott et al 
 
This preliminary study suggests differences  if any  in mental health across the  non religious non spiritual spectrum may be associated with coping mechanisms utilized and  perhaps  the congruence of coping style with  non belief system The current study sought to examine the relationships between pandemic related trauma symptoms   non religiousness and  non spirituality  coping strategies and psychological distress among U S  Americans 
In particular  we were interested in exploring differences  if any  between the coping mechanisms applied by individuals ranging from atheist to very religious and subsequent mental health outcomes  in response to the COVID  pandemic 
Specifically  we hypothesized that   the relationship between pandemic related trauma and psychological distress would operate indirectly through coping style and   the relationships between trauma  psychological distress and coping will be moderated by institutional religiousness and individual spirituality such that differences are observed in those at high and low levels of R S  as compared to moderate levels of R S  in the use of coping in response to the pandemic and the relationship between coping style and psychological distress  see Fig 
 One hundred fifty three participants   female    male    unreported sex assigned at birth  volunteered through social media snowball sampling 
The ethnic racial composition of the sample was   White    Black    Hispanic Latinx    Asian Asian American Pacific Islander and   Arab Persian Middle Eastern 
The median educational attainment was Associate s Degree level and the median reported household income was between   and  
Participants came from   different states with the largest contingents residing in Washington state   Texas   and California  
Twenty nine percent of the sample identified as disabled  specifically    identified a sensory impairment    a mobility impairment    a learning disability and   a mental health disorder 
Importantly    of respondents identified with a Christian faith  while a combined   identified as either atheist   agnostic   or religiously unaffiliated  
Data were collected in the period of time during which the majority of US jurisdictions had enacted  Stay At Home  or similar types of orders and recruitment was discontinued when restrictions were relaxed by many state and local governing bodies 
A post hoc sensitivity analysis revealed sufficient power for detecting medium sized effects  f      at standard significance and power criteria  α     power    Institutional Review Board approval was provided by Central Michigan University  – 
Data collection began in late April   and completed in mid June   and the study materials were pre registered on an open science forum at  https osf io tsdr 
Participants were recruited primarily via social media  e g  Reddit  and snowball sampling 
All U S based adults   years of age or older  were invited to engage in questions related to their experience of the pandemic  e g  stress  economic impact  isolation  and   surveys  Brief COPE  B COPE  Carver   Depression  Anxiety  Stress Scales –    DASS  Lovibond et al 
  NonReligious NonSpiritual Scale  NRNSS  Cragun et al 
  and a demographics questionnaire including items related to social physical distancing behaviors Coping strategies utilized by participants were assessed using the  item B COPE  Carver  
The scale is comprised of   subscales that may be organized into three composite subscales 
The acceptance  emotional support  humor  positive reframing and religion subscales  Emotion Focused  and active coping  instrumental support and planning subscales  Problem Focused  are categorized as Adaptive  whereas the behavioral disengagement  denial  self distraction  self blame  substance use and venting subscales  Dysfunctional  are Maladaptive  Carver et al 
 
Initial reliabilities were good  Emotion Focused     Problem Focused     Dysfunctional     and construct validity was evidenced  Cooper et al 
 
In the present study  internal consistency for each broad type of coping were as follows  Problem Focused Coping  α     Emotion Focused Coping  α     and Dysfunctional Coping  α    
The B COPE is the most frequently used measure of coping across academic journals 
Additionally  though the alpha for Emotion Focused Coping in this study is low  it is within the typical range reported for subscales in other studies using the B COPE  the two other subscales  alphas are similar to the median in extant literature  Kato  We additionally asked an open ended question prompting participants to report any coping behaviors in which they would normally engage but could not during the pandemic 
About half of participants   reported that they were unable to engage in some of their preferred coping behaviors and in all cases  the identified behaviors were emotion focused 
This likely contributed to the low internal consistency for Emotion Focused Coping 
Further  an exploratory reliability analysis with the sample split into high and low  non religiousness revealed that the emotion focused coping items had acceptable reliability for participants above the mean in institutional religiousness  α    Psychological distress was measured by the Depression  Anxiety  Stress Scales –    DASS  Lovibond et al 
  consisting of three subscales  Depression  Anxiety and Stress 
Participants were asked to report the degree to which statements  including  I found it hard to wind down  and  I felt I had nothing to look forward to  applied to them over the past week on a  point Likert scale ranging from  Did not apply to me at all  to  Applied to me very much  most of the time  Higher scores indicate higher rates of depressive  anxious and stress symptoms 
Initial reliabilities during development of the scale were α     for the Depression items  α     for the Anxiety items and α     for the Stress items 
Reliability for the entire scale in the current study was high  α    
 Non religiosity and  non spirituality were assessed via the NRNSS  Cragun et al 
  a  item measure consisting of two subscales  institutional religiousness and individual spirituality 
The NRNSS measures religiousness spirituality on a spectrum ranging from nonreligious nonspiritual to very religious spiritual 
Participants reported their level of agreement with items including  I would describe myself as a religious person  and  Spirituality is important to me  using a  point Likert scale 
High scores suggest low institutional religiousness  nonreligiosity  and low individual spirituality  nonspirituality  and  inversely  low scores indicate high religiousness and spirituality 
Initial testing demonstrated strong internal consistency  α    
In the present study  the α was   for the nonreligion subscale and   for the nonspirituality subscale The intensity of pandemic related trauma was assessed using   item   Overall  how traumatic is the COVID  pandemic for you 
Participants responded using a  point Likert scale ranging from  Not at all traumatic  to  Intolerably traumatic  Higher scores indicated participants perceived they were experiencing higher levels of personal trauma due to COVID 
This measure is consistent with the variable used when testing a similar model in our own previously published research  Abbott et al 
 The combination of trauma  institutional  non religiousness and the Trauma x  Non religiousness interaction predicted significant variance in two of the three types of coping  problem focused coping  R      F        p     and dysfunctional coping  R      F        p    
Significant unique predictors included  non religiousness  which was negatively associated with reduced problem focused and emotion focused coping and pandemic related trauma  which was positively associated with more dysfunctional coping 
The overall model was not significant for emotion focused coping  R      F        p    
See Table   for summaries of unique effects of predictors on mediators The combination of trauma   non religiousness  problem focused coping  emotion focused coping  dysfunctional coping  Trauma x  Non religiousness  Problem focused Coping x  Non religiousness  Emotion focused Coping x  Non religiousness and Dysfunctional Coping x  Non religiousness predicted significant variance in psychological distress  R      F        p    
Significant unique predictors included trauma  problem focused coping and dysfunctional coping 
Increased trauma and dysfunctional coping were each associated with increased psychological distress  while increased problem focused coping predicted lower distress 
See Table   for a summary of the effects of unique predictors on the outcome variable While the interaction between trauma and  non religiousness was nonsignificant  indicating it cannot be concluded that individuals were affected by trauma differently based on their level of institutional  non religiousness  the conditional direct effect of trauma on psychological distress was significant at low and moderate levels of institutional  non religiousness but not significant at high levels of  non religiousness 
However  the conditional indirect effect of trauma on psychological distress through the mechanism of dysfunctional coping was significant at high nonreligiousness and moderate levels of  non religiousness  but not at low levels of  non religiousness Trauma and dysfunctional coping were both significant predictors of psychological distress and the trauma effect was significant via the mechanism of dysfunctional coping at moderate and high levels of  non religiousness 
This indicates  perhaps  that both religious and nonreligious individuals experienced psychological distress in the aftermath of trauma but that nonreligious individuals experienced psychological distress due to utilization of dysfunctional coping strategies 
The question of whether the direct and indirect effects are different for those across the spectrum of institutional  non religiousness remains unclear with current statistical power  however 
See Table   for summaries of unique effects of predictors on depressive symptoms The combination of trauma   non spirituality and the Trauma x  Non spirituality interaction predicted significant variance in two of the three types of coping  Problem focused coping  R      F        p     and dysfunctional coping  R      F        p    
The overall model was not significant for emotion focused coping  R      F        p    
Significant unique predictors included higher levels of  non spirituality associated with reduced problem focused coping and higher levels of pandemic related trauma associated with higher levels of dysfunctional coping 
See Table   for summaries of unique effects of predictors on mediators The combination of trauma   non spirituality  problem focused coping  emotion focused coping  dysfunctional coping  Trauma x  Non spirituality  Problem focused Coping x  Non spirituality  Emotion focused Coping x  Non spirituality and Dysfunctional Coping x  Non spirituality predicted significant variance in psychological distress  R      F        p    
Significant unique predictors included trauma  problem focused coping  dysfunctional coping and the  Non spirituality x Dysfunctional Coping interaction 
Increased trauma and dysfunctional coping were both associated with higher psychological distress  whereas increased problem focused coping predicting lower depressive symptoms 
See Table   for summaries of unique effects of predictors on the outcome variable Probing the  Non spirituality x Dysfunctional Coping interaction showed that the indirect effect of trauma on psychological distress through the mechanism of dysfunctional coping was significant at moderate and high levels of  non spirituality but not at low levels of  non spirituality 
This is consistent with the nonsignificant trend found in the  non religiousness model reported above and lends credence to the assumption that the interaction in that model should reach significance with more statistical power The relationship between pandemic related trauma and psychological distress in the current examination is congruent with previous collective trauma research  Baral et al 
  Goldmann et al 
  including a similar examination of coping and  non religiousness following a natural disaster  Abbott et al 
  and emerging data related to COVID   Schecter et al 
 
Therefore  it appears depressive  anxious and stress symptoms are possible in response to the COVID  pandemic among people in the US across the  non religious non spiritual spectrum Evidence regarding the relationships between religiousness and health is mixed 
Some research has suggested a curvilinear relationship between  non religiousness and health  Galen   but assumptions of compromised health among nonreligious people persist  in part due to an abundance of scholarship demonstrating a positive relationship between religiousness and psychological health  Paloutzian et al 
 
More recent research found comparable health outcomes and levels of happiness among theists and nontheists  Speed et al 
  and emphasized the importance of a coherent sense of the world and congruence between  non religiousness non spirituality and behaviors for health outcomes  Speed et al 
 
Our results may speak to some nuances in this relationship and the contexts in which it operates 
First  our results are consistent with prior findings indicating that those with moderate levels of religiousness exhibit lower well being than their highly religious or nonreligious counterparts  Galen et al 
  and that this may be related to dysfunctional coping 
Second  the unique context of the COVID  pandemic  associated stay at home orders and the resulting physical distancing recommendations may have exacerbated social isolation among nonbelievers and prevented them from engaging in effective emotion focused coping strategies as evidenced by the low reliability of the emotion focused coping items for nonreligious individuals and the open ended responses Internal consistency for the emotion focused coping subscale was adequate among more religious participants 
Indeed  religious spiritual participants could still engage in independent faith based coping strategies including prayer  meditation and comfort in their belief system and places of religious worship were among the first locations allowed to reopen in many areas of the country 
Although nonreligious people benefit similarly from social connection with like minded people  Galen   organized groups of nonbelievers can be difficult to find  inaccessible to nonbelievers with marginalized cultural positionalities  Abbott et al 
  or primarily online where the benefits of engagement on mental health may be less pronounced  Brewster et al 
  even under normal circumstances 
All of this is consistent with the notion that social support and belonging are the driving mechanisms behind the well documented relationship between religious commitment and well being Further  although previous research suggested nonreligious nonspiritual people were more likely to use problem focused coping in response to collective trauma in the form of a natural disaster  Abbott et al 
  perhaps due to their tendency to engage in analytical thinking to evaluate circumstances  Franks et al 
  Baker et al 
  most people are likely able to draw upon knowledge of other natural disasters by which they or others have been impacted in determining a personal response 
The novel nature of the COVID  pandemic may have made it difficult for nonreligious people to engage in otherwise preferred and problem focused methods of coping like planning  taking action to improve the situation and soliciting advice from others 
Substance use  a dysfunctional coping strategy  is associated with COVID related stress  particularly among women  Rodriguez et al 
  and represents a possible explanation for the relationship between higher trauma intensity and higher use of dysfunctional coping in the current investigation given a little over two thirds of participants were women The current study was limited by having insufficient statistical power for detecting small effects 
The limited time frame for collecting data  during the time period during which US jurisdictions enacted the most restrictive measures to contain the novel coronavirus and a lack of funding for quickly recruiting large numbers of participants resulted in a study powered enough to detect medium sized effects and larger 
As only   participants out of the already modest sample agreed to be contacted for follow up  we were unable to conduct a pre registered follow up data collection phase meant to measure posttraumatic growth 
Future research examining differences in coping strategies in response to traumatic events among individuals across the  non religious non spiritual spectrum should seek larger samples  employ longitudinal methods and explore other relevant variables  e g  posttraumatic growth  given this and previous research  e g  Abbott et al 
  have demonstrated important differences between individuals high and low on such measures Like all COVID  research conducted with a nationwide sample  this study was also subject to uncontrolled variance due to the US  lack of a coordinated national response to the pandemic 
Restrictions varied greatly state by state and sometimes county by county 
Some states also lagged far behind others in terms of the timing and severity of the pandemic s effects on public health and the economy 
Future research should  if possible  control for these factors perhaps using geographically nested analyses or by concentrating on a specific geographic region An error in survey design led to the omission of a measure for participant age 
Age effects would be hard to find in this study due to the relatively small sample size and the use of a sampling method  e g  Reddit  that would likely result in a very young sample 
A majority of young adults  however  are living with their parents rather than cohabitating with a friend  spouse  or significant other during the COVID  pandemic  Fry et al 
  which could  along with the increased propensity for the young to be non religious  Pew Research Center   make it more difficult for them to engage in emotion focused coping during a socially isolating event like a pandemic 
Future research should also examine age related differences in coping styles and outcomes during the coronavirus era The present examination suggests a complex relationship between self perceived COVID related trauma intensity  coping strategies  psychological distress and  non religiousness non spirituality  such that people across the  non religious non spiritual spectrum experience distress related to the COVID  pandemic 
However  the use and availability of typical adaptive and maladaptive coping mechanisms appears to vary by strength of  non religious non spiritual orientation in response to collective trauma 
Future  large scale studies are needed to continue exploring the relationship between exposure to collective traumatic events  psychological health and coping among people of diverse  non religious and  non spiritual identities in the interest of understanding what adaptive coping strategies are most useful  particularly for nontheists given their underrepresentation in extant trauma and coping literature A case of macrophage activation syndrome in a patient with anti synthetase syndromeAnti synthetase syndrome  ASS  is an autoimmune disease characterized by autoantibodies against an aminoacyl transfer RNA  tRNA  synthetase with clinical features that may include interstitial lung disease  ILD  non erosive arthritis  myositis  Raynaud s phenomenon  unexplained fever and or mechanic s hands   
Macrophage activation syndrome  MAS  can be a fatal complication of rheumatic disorders 
It has rarely been reported in patients with ASS 
Here  we describe this association in an adult patient We present a case of  year old Nepalese female with an overlap of ASS and anti cyclic citrullinated peptide  CCP  antibody positive rheumatoid arthritis  RA  who developed MAS which was successfully treated with anakinra 
She was diagnosed with ASS based on the presence of arthritis  ILD  anti Jo  and antiRo  autoantibodies 
She was maintained on  monthly Rituximab cycles  one  gm infusion repeated   days after the first for each cycle  completed two cycles  last given   months prior to her presentation 
In view of the coronavirus disease    COVID  pandemic the third cycle was withheld and Azathioprine was commenced which she took for   weeks 
Two weeks prior to her admission Azathioprine was switched to an up titrating dose of Mycophenolate due to nonspecific symptoms of headache and dizziness attributed to possible medication intolerance 
She was admitted with fever  abdominal pain and headaches 
Clinical examination revealed pyrexia  C  hypotension   mmHg  tachycardia  HR   bpm  and palmar maculopapular rash 
Laboratory investigations showed pancytopenia  Hb    –  g L  WCC    –     L  Platelets    –     L  Neutrophils    –     L  lymphocytes    –      L  Ferritin of      –  ug L  Triglycerides     mmol L  LDH    –  IU L  Fibrinogen   g l normal  ALT     IU L  CRP    –  mg L  and ESR   mm hr A septic screen for common bacterial and viral pathogens including parvovirus  Epstein Barr virus  Cytomegalovirus  human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis was negative 
Multiple covid  swabs were negative 
Computed tomography of chest  abdomen and pelvis showed no evidence of hepatosplenomegaly or an underlying malignancy 
Lack of improvement with broad spectrum antimicrobials  evolving pancytopenia  elevated ferritin and persistent fever with patient s background history of autoimmune disease raised concerns about MAS 
She fulfilled the   HScore by Fardet et al 
  with a score of    cut off    Fig  
Treatment with IV methylprednisolone   mg kg day for   days was initiated followed by oral prednisolone    mg along with ciclosporin   mg kg d 
She had a history of type   diabetes  was on oral hypoglycaemic medications but developed hyperglycaemia and ketosis secondary to steroid and required Insulin therapy 
Anakinra   mg once daily subcutaneously was added after Multidisciplinary team discussion to reduce steroid toxicity and facilitate a rapid steroid taper  whilst providing optimal disease control 
Immediate clinical improvement was noted with normalization of fevers and gradual normalization of laboratory abnormalities including ferritin  cell counts  Fig   and inflammatory markers 
We believe an underlying rheumatic immune disorder was the likely predisposing factor for the development of MAS in our patient  as she was not maintained on biologic immunomodulatory therapy due to paused Rituximab in view of COVID  pandemic and possible intolerance to various agents Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis  HLH  is characterized by an unregulated inflammatory response with cytokine storm leading to multisystem organ failure and can be fatal if not recognized and treated promptly 
HLH can be familial  primary  or acquired  secondary to infection  malignancy or active autoinflammation 
Secondary HLH  sHLH  in association with rheumatologic autoimmune diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus  adult onset Still disease  and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis is known as MAS   
However  it is rarely seen in patients with ASS and has been described only in case reports where most patients reportedly suffered from dermatomyositis 
Anti  Jo  anti  Mi  and anti MDA  autoantibodies have been found in cases of idiopathic inflammatory myositis complicated by MAS   
Early diagnosis is often challenging due to clinical manifestations mimicking sepsis  active autoimmune diseases and lack of widely accepted diagnostic criteria 
Various tools have been developed which use clinical symptoms and laboratory abnormalities to risk stratify patients but have limitations 
The H score by Fardet et al 
  has been validated for the diagnosis of reactive HLH and subsequently showed good diagnostic accuracy in an observational study by Knaak et al 
  
However  clinical judgement and awareness of the condition remains paramount in diagnosis 
Timely diagnosis and treatment to reduce systemic inflammation is imperative to reduce high mortality 
High dose glucocorticoid monotherapy is usually the first line treatment with subsequent addition of immunomodulatory agents in refractory cases   
Over recent years  various biologics and immunotherapies have been used successfully for MAS treatment 
This also includes Anakinra  a recombinant interleukin   IL  receptor antagonist used in various autoinflammatory diseases 
Although limited  there are now case reports and series showing favourable response to anakinra  both subcutaneously and intravenously in sHLH subtypes   
Its use is also appealing due to relatively short half life that permits its discontinuation if an adverse effect occurs or concern for worsening infection arises Our case was challenging as patient initially manifested joint symptoms with positive immunology for RA and later developed ILD with positive ASS immune profile in the absence of clinical myositis  typical skin rash and normal CK levels 
Aminoacyl tRNA positivity has been described in patients who fulfilled RA diagnostic criteria in the literature and hence ASS is an important clinical condition in the differential diagnosis of early RA 
It has been reported that development of myositis can take years after onset of arthritis and ILD  which are also not rarely seen before myositis and in some myositis never occurs   
The most common arthritis pattern seen in ASS is small joint symmetrical polyarthritis quite similar what seen in RA 
AntiCCP and rheumatoid factor positivity can be observed in ASS and lead to false RA diagnosis

Recombination events have been demonstrated to be associated with viruses expanding their host range   or increasing their virulence    thus accompanying  or perhaps even being at the origin of  major changes during virus adaptation 
It remains unclear  however  whether recombination events represent a highly frequent and significant phenomenon in the everyday life of these viruses Viruses can exchange genetic material when at least two different viral genomes co infect the same host cell 
Progeny can then become hybrid through different mechanisms  such as reassortment of segments when the parental genomes are fragmented    intra molecular recombination when polymerases switch templates  in RNA viruses     or homologous or non homologous recombination  in both RNA and DNA viruses 
Quantification of viral recombination in multi cellular organisms has been attempted under two distinct experimental approaches  in vitro  in cell cultures     and in vivo  in live hosts    
The in vitro approach  which has so far been applied only to animal viruses  allows the establishment of the  intrinsic  recombination rate in experimentally co infected cells in cell cultures   
However  it does not necessarily reflect the situation in entire  living hosts  where the frequency of co infected cells is poorly known and depends on many factors such as the size of the pathogen population  the relative frequency and distribution of the different variants  and host defense mechanisms preventing secondary infection of cells 
The in vivo experimental approach is closer to biological conditions and may thus be more informative of what actually happens in  the real world However  as discussed below  numerous experimental constraints have so far precluded an actual quantification of the baseline rate of recombination 
First  many experimental designs have used extreme positive selection  where only recombinant genomes were viable  e g    
Other studies did not use complementation techniques but detected recombinants by PCR within infected hosts or tissues    which provides information on their presence but not on their frequency in the viral population 
So far  no quantitative PCR or other quantitative method has been applied to evaluate the number of recombinants appearing in an experimentally infected live host 
Finally  recent methods based on sequence analysis inferred the population recombination rate  rather than the individual recombination rate   
While results from these methods certainly take in vivo recombination into account  there are other caveats  isolates have often been collected in different hosts sometimes in different geographical regions and sometimes the selective neutrality of sequence variation on which these estimates are based is not clearly established 
Estimates from such studies by essence address the estimation of the recombination rate at a different evolutionary scale Taken together  the currently available information indicates that no viral recombination rate has ever been estimated directly at time and space scales corresponding to a single multi cellular host infection  although this level is most significant for the biology and evolution of viruses 
This study intends to fill this gap by evaluating the recombination frequency of the cauliflower mosaic virus  CaMV  during a single passage in one of its host plants  the turnip Brassica rapa CaMV is a pararetrovirus  which is a major grouping containing hepadnaviruses  e g  hepatitis B virus  badnaviruses  e g  banana streak virus  and caulimoviruses  e g  CaMV 
Pararetroviruses are characterized by a non segmented double stranded DNA genome 
After entering the host cell nucleus  the viral DNA accumulates as a minichromosome   whose transcription is ensured by the host RNA polymerase II   
The CaMV genome consists in approximately   bp and encodes six viral gene products that have been detected in planta  Figure     
Viral proteins P  to P  are expressed from two major transcripts  namely a  S RNA  encoding P  and a  S RNA corresponding to the entire genome and serving as mRNA for proteins P –P    
Using the pre genomic  S RNA as a matrix  the protein P   product of gene V  reverse transcribes the genome into genomic DNA that is concomitantly encapsidated   The detection of CaMV recombinants in turnip hosts has been reported numerous times 
Some studies have demonstrated the appearance of infectious recombinant viral genomes after inoculation  i  of a host plant with two infectious or non infectious parental clones   or  ii  of a transgenic plant containing one CaMV transgene with a CaMV genome missing the corresponding genomic region   
While the former revealed inter genomic viral recombination  the latter demonstrated that CaMV can also recombine with transgenes within the host s genome 
Another study based on phylogenetic analyses of various CaMV strains has clearly suggested different origins for different genomic regions and  hence  multiple recombination events during the evolution of this virus   
Indirect experimental evidence has indicated that  in some cases  CaMV recombination could occur within the host nucleus  between different viral minichromosomes  presumably through the action of the DNA repair cellular machinery   
Nevertheless  the mechanism of  template switching  during reverse transcription  predominant in all retroviruses  most certainly also applies to pararetroviruses 
For this reason  and on the basis of numerous experimental data  CaMV is generally believed to recombine mostly in the cytoplasm of the host cell  by  legal  template switching between two pre genomic RNA molecules    or  illegal  template switching between the  S and the  S RNA   
Under this hypothesis  recombination in CaMV could therefore be considered as operating on a linear template during reverse transcription  with the  ′ and  ′ extremities later ligated to circularize the genomic DNA  position   in Figure  
The above cited studies clearly demonstrate that CaMV is able to recombine 
However  since these studies are based on complementation techniques  non quantitative detection  or phylogenetically based inferences of recombination  they do not inform us on whether recombination is an exceptional event or an  everyday  process shaping the genetic composition of CaMV populations In the present work  we aimed at answering this question 
To this end  we have constructed a CaMV genome with four genetic markers  demonstrated to be neutral in competition experiments 
By co inoculating host plants with equal amounts of wild type and marker containing CaMV particles  we have generated mixed populations in which impressive proportions of recombinants distributed in several different classes corresponding to exchange of different genomic regions have been detected and quantified 
Altogether  the recombinant genomes averaged over   of the population 
Further analysis of these data  assuming a number of viral replications during the infection period ranging from five to   indicates that the per nucleotide per replication cycle recombination rate of CaMV is of the same order of magnitude  i e  on the order of a few   across the entire genome 
We thereby provide the first quantification  to our knowledge  of the recombination rate in a virus population during a single passage in a single host From Figure   and supposing that all marker containing genomic regions can recombine  we could predict the detection and quantification of seven classes of recombinant genotypes   bcd a  a cd b  ab d c  abc d   cd ab  a d bc  and a c b d 
Indeed  all classes were detected  and their frequencies in the ten CaMV populations analyzed are summarized in Table  Altogether  the proportion of recombinant genomes found in the mixed viral populations was astonishingly high and very similar in the ten co infected plants analyzed  Table   last column  ranging between    plant   to    plants     and   with a mean frequency   standard error  of      
This result indicates that recombination events are very frequent during the invasion of the host plant by CaMV and represents  to our knowledge  the first direct quantification of viral recombination during the infection of a live multi cellular host The inferred per generation recombination and interference rates  assuming that CaMV undergoes ten replication cycles during the   d between infection and sampling  are given for each of the ten plants in Table  
Recombination rates between adjacent markers are large  on the order of   to  
Taking the distance in nucleotides between markers into account yields an average recombination rate per nucleotide and generation on the order of      
Interestingly  this recombination rate does not vary throughout the genome  Kruskal–Wallis test  p    To relax the assumption of the number of replications during the   d  we calculated the recombination parameters assuming five or   generations 
The effect of the number of generations on the estimates is linear  doubling the number of generations results in a halving of the recombination rate  detailed results not shown 
For example  the average recombination rates r
  r
  and r
  assuming   generations were equal to     and   respectively  compare with values in Table   yielding per nucleotide per generation recombination rates of             and      Inspection of Table   also shows that first order interference coefficients were in general negative  indicating that a crossing over in one genomic segment increases the probability that a crossing over will occur in another genomic segment  while the second order coefficient parameter had an average value close to zero with a large variance 
The mechanism leading to these results will be discussed in the following section One major breakthrough in the work presented here lies in the space and time scales at which the experiments were performed 
Indeed  the processes occurring within the course of a single infection of one multi cellular host are of obvious biological relevance for any disease 
Previous studies on viral recombination suffered from major drawbacks in this respect  basing their conclusions on experiments relying on complementation among non infectious viruses or between viruses with undetermined relative fitness  on phylogenetically based analyses  or on experiments in cell cultures 
For reasons detailed in the Introduction  the first two methods either do not provide information on the frequency of recombination  but only its occurrence  or address the question at a different temporal  and often spatial  scale 
Results from cell cultures  on the other hand  impose cell co infection by different viral variants  potentially overestimating the frequency of recombination events 
Our study circumvents these limitations by analyzing viral genotypes sampled from infected plants after the course of a single infection  and therefore the invasion and co infection of cells in various organs and tissues is very close to natural More than half of the genomes       see Table   present in a CaMV population after a single passage in its host plant were identified as recombinants  and these data allowed us to infer a per nucleotide per generation recombination rate on the order of       to      
The time length of one generation  i e  the time required for a given genome to go from one replication to the next  is totally unknown in plant viruses 
The only experimental data available on CaMV are based on the kinetics of gene expression in infected protoplasts  where the capsid protein is produced between   and   h   
The reverse transcription and the encapsidation of genomic DNA being two coupled phenomena    we judged it reasonable to assume a generation time of   d and  thus  an average of ten generations during our experiments 
In case this estimate is mistaken  we have verified a linear relationship between r and the number of generations  thereby allowing an immediate adjustment of r if the CaMV generation time is more precisely established 
At this point  we must consider that all cloned genomes may not have been through all the successive replication events potentially allowed by the timing of our experiments 
It was previously shown that about   of CaMV mature virus particles accumulate in compact inclusion bodies    where they may be sequestered for a long time  as such inclusions are very frequent in all infected cells  including those in leaves that have been invaded by the virus population for several weeks 
The viral population may thus present an age structure that could bias the estimation of the recombination rate 
In order to minimize this bias  the clones we analyzed were collected in one young newly formed leaf  where the chances of finding genomes from  unsequestered lines  were assumed to be higher 
In any case  our data analysis is conservative  since this age structure can only lead to an underestimation of the recombination rate Our results show that interferences between pairs of loci are negative  a recombination event between two loci apparently increases the probability of recombination between another pair of loci 
We believe that the most parsimonious explanation of these negative interferences is based on the way the infection builds up within plant hosts 
Indeed  one can divide infected host cells into those infected by a single virus genotype and those infected by more than one viral genotype 
In the former  analogous to clonal propagation  recombination is undetectable 
In the latter  recombination is not only detectable but  as our results indicate  very frequent 
Samples consisting of viruses resulting from a mixture of these two types of host cell infections will thus contain viruses with no recombination and viruses with several recombination events  thus yielding an impression of negative interference 
These conceptual arguments are supported by mathematical models 
It is indeed easy to show  detailed results not shown  that if a proportion F of the population reproduces clonally  analogous to single infections  while the remaining reproduces panmictically  negative interferences could be inferred even if they do not exist 
For example  assuming a three locus model with real recombination rates r
  and r
  and interference i
  the  apparent  recombination and interference parameters  would be r
        F r  r
        F r
  and i
     F   i
    F 
Interestingly  this example also shows that our estimates of the recombination rate are conservative  that a fraction F of host cells are singly infected while others are multiply infected leads to an underestimation of the recombination rate As judged by r
  r
  and r
  calculated between markers a–b  b–c  and c–d  respectively  we found evidence for recombination through the entire CaMV genome 
The values for r
 
r
  and r
  are remarkably similar  hence the recombination sites seem to be evenly distributed along the genome 
We considered the template switching model as the major way recombinants are created in CaMV 
As already mentioned in the Introduction  hot spots of template switching have been predicted at the position of the  ′ extremities of the  S and  S RNAs   
If other recombination mechanisms  such as that associated with second strand DNA synthesis or with the host cell DNA repair machinery  act significantly  hot spots would be expected at the positions of the sequence interruption     and     
Due to the design of our experiment and the position of the four markers  we have no information on putative hot spots at positions corresponding to the  ′ end of the  S RNA and to    at nucleotide position  
Nevertheless  the putative hot spots at the  ′ end of the  S RNA and at   and    nucleotide positions   and   respectively  fall between marker pairs c–d  b–c  and a–b  respectively 
Our results indicate that either these hot spots are quantitatively equivalent though predicted by different recombination mechanisms or  more likely  that they simply do not exist 
Whatever the explanation  what we observe is that the CaMV can exchange any portion of its genome  and thus any gene thereof  with an astonishingly high frequency during the course of a single host infection To our knowledge  the viral recombination rate has never previously been quantified experimentally for a plant virus   
In contrast  retroviruses and particularly HIV  have been extensively investigated in that sense 
As we have already discussed for these latter cases  the quantification of the intrinsic recombination rate was carried out in artificially co infected cell cultures 
The estimated intrinsic per nucleotide per generation recombination rate in HIV  is on the order of      less than one order of magnitude higher than our estimation for CaMV 
Because for various reasons detailed above we probably underestimate the within host CaMV recombination rate  we believe that the intrinsic recombination rate in CaMV is higher and perhaps on the order of that of HIV Other pararetroviruses such as plant badnaviruses or vertebrate hepadnaviruses have a similar cycle within their host cells  including steps of nuclear minichromosome  genomic size RNA synthesis  and reverse transcription and encapsidation 
Nevertheless  vertebrate hepadnaviruses  e g  hepatitis B virus  infect hosts that are very different from plants in their biology and physiology  and this could lead to a totally different frequency of cell co infection during the development of the virus populations 
Thus  even though our results can be informative for other pararetroviruses because of the viruses  shared biological characteristics  they should not be extrapolated to vertebrate pararetroviruses without caution We used the plasmid pCa  which is the complete genome of the CaMV isolate Cabb S  cloned into the pBR  plasmid at the unique SalI restriction site   
To analyze recombination in different regions of the genome  we introduced four genetic markers  a  b  c  and d  at the positions       and   respectively  thus approximately at four cardinal points of the CaMV circular double stranded DNA of   bp  Figure  
All markers  each corresponding to a single nucleotide change  were introduced by PCR directed mutagenesis in pCa  and resulted in the duplication of previously unique restriction sites BsiWI  PstI  MluI  and SacI in a plasmid designated pMark S  Because  in this study  we targeted the possible exchange of genes between viral genomes  all markers a  b  c  and d were introduced within coding regions corresponding to open reading frames I  IV  V  and VI  respectively 
Another important concern was to quantify recombination in the absence of selection  i e  to create neutral markers 
Consequently all markers consist of synonymous mutations  see below To generate the parental virus particles  plasmids pCa  and pMark S were mechanically inoculated into individual plants as previously described   
All plants were turnips  B  rapa cv   Just Right  grown under glasshouse conditions at   °C with a    light dark  photoperiod 
Thirty days post inoculation  all symptomatic leaves were harvested and viral particles were purified as described earlier   The resulting preparations of parental viruses  designated Cabb S and Mark S  were quantified by spectrometry using the formula described by Hull et al 
  
We fixed the initial frequency of markers to a value of   and a solution containing   mg ml of virus particles of both Cabb S and Mark S at a   ratio was prepared 
Plantlets were co infected by mechanical inoculation of two to three leaves with   μl of this virus solution  using abrasive Celite AFA  Fluka  Ronkonkoma  New York  United States 
The mixed CaMV population was allowed to grow during   d of systemic infection We designed an experimental protocol for quantifying marker frequency within a mixed Cabb S Mark S virus population after a single passage in a host plant 
Twenty four individual plants  inoculated as above with equal amounts of Cabb S and Mark S  were harvested   d post inoculation  when symptoms were fully developed 
The viral DNA was purified from   mg of young newly formed infected leaves according to the protocol described previously   
After the precipitation step of this protocol  the viral DNA was resuspended and further purified with the Wizard DNA clean up kit  Promega  Fitchburg  Wisconsin  United States  in TE  X   mM Tris HCl and   mM EDTA  pH   
Aliquots of viral DNA preparations were digested by restriction enzymes corresponding either to marker a  b  c  or d and submitted to a   agarose gel electrophoresis  colored by ethydium bromide and exposed to UV 
Each individual restriction enzyme cut once in Cabb S DNA and twice in Mark S  thus generating DNA fragments of different sizes attributable to one or the other in the mixed population of CaMV genomes 
After scanning the agarose gels  we estimated the relative frequency of the two genotypes in each viral DNA preparation and at each marker position  by densitometry using the NIH   Image program 
The statistical analyses of the frequency of the four markers are described below To identify and quantify the recombinants within the CaMV mixed populations  aliquots from ten of the   viral DNA preparations described above were digested by the restriction enzyme SalI  and directly cloned into pUC  at the corresponding site 
In each of the ten viral populations analyzed    full genome length clones were digested separately by BsiWI  PstI  MluI  and SacI  to test for the presence of marker a  b  c  and d  respectively 
In this experiment  with the marker representing an additional restriction site  we could easily distinguish between the Cabb S and the Mark S genotype at all four marker positions  upon agarose gel   electrophoresis of the digested clones 
Clones with none or all four markers were parental genotypes  whereas clones harboring     or   markers were clearly recombinants 
Due to the very high number of recombinants detected  markers eventually appearing or disappearing due to spontaneous mutations were neglected Here we present the different methods we used to quantify recombination in the CaMV genome 
Because all these methods assume that the different markers are neutral  we first discuss assumption We used two datasets to test the neutrality of markers  both resulting from plants co infected with a   ratio of Mark S and Cabb S 
The first consisted of viral DNA densitometry data derived from   plants  described above  where for each plant we have an estimate of the frequency of each marker in the genome population 
The second consisted of the restriction of   individual full genome length viral clones obtained from one co infected plant  described above  yielding an estimate of the frequency of each marker  and this was repeated on ten different plants 
The frequencies of the different markers were       and   for markers a  b  c  and d in the first dataset and       and   in the second dataset 
We tested whether these frequencies were significantly different from the expected value under neutrality    using either t tests  for datasets where normality could not be rejected  seven out of eight cases  or Wilcoxon signed rank non parametric tests otherwise  marker c in the first dataset 
In all cases p values were larger than  There are several cautionary remarks regarding these analyses 
First  in all cases we found an excess of markers 
Unfortunately  the two datasets cannot be regarded as independent because  even though the methods through which the frequency estimates were obtained were different  the plants used in the second dataset were a subset of the plants of the first 
We thus have only four independent estimates in each case  and there is minimal power to detect significant deviations from neutrality with such a small sample size 
It should be noted at this stage that deviations from the expected value could also be caused either by slight deviations from the   ratio in the infecting mixed solution  or by deviations from that ratio in the frequency of the viral particles that actually get into the plants 
Second  because of the relatively small sample sizes and low statistical power  the tests presented above could have detected only large deviations The results clearly show  however  precisely that the markers do not have large effects  if any  and that therefore recombination estimates would be affected only very slightly by any hypothetical selective effects of the markers 
Because of this  along with the fact that the introduced markers provoke silent substitutions in the CaMV genome  we assumed that markers were effectively neutral in the rest of the analysis The dataset used to estimate the recombination frequency consisted of the   full genome length viral clones   from each of ten co infected plants  individually genotyped for each of the four markers 
As discussed in detail in the Results  recombination was very frequent and concerned all four markers 
Indeed  approximately half of the genotyped clones exhibited a recombinant genotype 
It was therefore meaningful to try to obtain quantitative estimates of recombination from our data Our aim was to analyze viral recombination in a live host 
Consequently  we had to deal with the fact that more than one viral replication cycle occurred during the   d that infection lasted in our experiment  we had to wait that long for the disease to develop and to be able to recover sufficient amounts of viral DNA from each infection 
Based on the kinetics of gene expression    we postulate that each replication cycle lasts between   and   d  and that therefore seven to ten cycles occurred between infection and the sampling time 
In case this assumption is incorrect  we did calculations assuming five  seven  ten  or   replication cycles during these   d  As shown  the results were not affected qualitatively  and only slightly quantitatively 
It is important to note that we assumed that recombination occurred through a template switching mechanism  and that therefore  from a recombination point of view  the CaMV genome is linear 
The reverse transcription starts and finishes at the position   in Figure   which is the point of circularization of the DNA genome 
This implies that changes between contiguous markers a–b  b–c  and c–d can be considered as true recombination whereas those between a and d cannot  as they may simply stem from circularization of DNA  during the synthesis of which the polymerase has switched template once anywhere between a–b  b–c  or c–d To estimate the recombination rate between markers  we wrote recurrence equations describing the change in frequency of each genotype over one generation  assuming random mating and no selection  i e  the standard Wright–Fisher population genetics model 
We then expressed the frequency of all possible genotypes n generations later as a function of their initial frequency and of the recombination parameters 
Subsequently we calculated the maximum likelihood estimates of the recombination parameters and their asymptotic variances given initial frequencies  we assumed that the two  parental  genotypes  Mark S and Cabb S  had equal initial frequencies of   and that all other genotypes had initial frequencies of zero  and frequencies after n generations  the observed frequencies  as stated above we used different values of n 
All algebraic and numerical calculations were carried out with the software Mathematica The recombination parameters are the recombination rates between two adjacent loci  e g  r
  for the recombination rate between markers a and b  and the interference coefficients  e g  i
  for interference between recombination events in the segments between markers a and b and b and c  To define these parameters we followed Christiansen    and in particular the recombination distributions for two  three  and four loci  respectively  Tables     and   of   
It is important to realize that given the definitions of these parameters  the estimator of the recombination rate between two loci is not affected by the number of loci considered 
In other words  we obtain the same estimation of the recombination rate between markers a and b whether we consider genotypic frequencies at just these two loci  or the frequencies at these two loci plus a third locus  or the complete information to which we have access  the four marker genotypes 
Information on additional loci only affects the estimates of the interference coefficients It proved impossible to carry out the calculations for four loci algebraically 
Instead  we used a computer program to calculate the expected genotypic frequencies at all four loci after n generations  given the above stated initial frequencies and specified recombination parameters 
For each combination of recombination parameters we calculated a Euclidean distance between the vector of the expected genotypic frequencies and the observed genotypic frequencies  and considered that the estimated recombination parameters were those yielding the minimal Euclidean distance 
In all cases  the estimated recombination rates between pairs of loci were equal to the second decimal to those estimated algebraically from data for three or two loci Tumor Restrictions to Oncolytic VirusIn most solid tumors the tumor interior displays a high cellular density with multiple cell types  both malignant and normal  stromal  cells  interdigitated by strands of extracellular matrix  ECM  and other poorly defined tissue 
Stromal cells typically consist of fibroblasts  macrophages  neutrophils and other immune cell types 
Tumor associated fibroblasts are a source of the bulk acellular tissue in tumors    which is largely made up of polysugars and glycoproteins  such as collagens  laminins  fibronectins  proteoglycans  hyaluronan and water  forming a dense matrix around and between the cancer cells   
This matrix provides structural support but also haptotactic and chemotactic guidance for cancer cells   
Moreover  the prevailing tumor interstitium is rich in soluble angiogenic factors  such as members of the vascular endothelial growth factor  VEGF  family    cellular growth factors  including endothelial growth factor  EGF  basic fibroblast growth factor  FGF  platelet derived growth factor  PDGF  and pleiotrophic factors  particularly transforming growth factor  TGF  beta   
Additionally  both tumor  and stromal cells secrete cytokines and chemokines  such as interleukin  IL    IL   tumor necrosis factor  TNF  alpha  stromal cell derived factor  SDF    macrophage migration inhibitory factor  MIF    which on one hand recruit more stromal and progenitor cells into the tumors and on the other hand curb the activity of antigen presenting cells and anti tumor T cells   
In several independent cancer types  high serum levels of IL   and IL   are indicators of poor prognosis   Aberrant tumor and stromal growth combined with an overproduction of matrix leads to high interstitial pressure in the tumor  preventing lateral diffusion of therapeutic compounds within the tumor 
Tight cellular compactness combined with a high tumor proliferation rate also causes physical crowding and puts constraints on oxygenation  which due to aberrant angiogenesis and rupture of the haphazard vessels is mostly incomplete and results in chronic tissue hypoxia toward the tumor cores 
As cancer cells exist in a crowding hypoxic  and cytokine growth factor perpetuated chronic state of stress  they upregulate a number of key cellular molecules that function as a collective defense against a wide range of therapies  including oncolytic viruses 
The properties of oncolytic viruses and their status in clinical development as well as various delivery options have been reviewed elsewhere   
In this review  we provide an overview of two of the main intratumoral barriers to oncolytic virus spread  the extracellular tumor make up and the intracellular antiviral defense mechanisms Tumor cellular structure and composition may in concert with abundant extracellular matrix  ECM  deposition pose a severe hurdle for systemic virus entry and propagation of infection within the tumor 
The extracellular matrix is a complex dense network consisting of multiple proteins  glycoproteins and polysaccharides including collagens  laminins  fibronectins  proteoglycans and hyaluronic acid   
The interstitial fluid pressure  IFP  in the tumor surrounding blood and lymphatic vessels is mainly created by the high cell density that forms an increased physical pressure outwards and does not allow free diffusion of therapeutics   
A high IFP generally predicts an aggressive tumor phenotype as tumor cells tend to escape from tumor margins where the pressure drops  thus facilitating spread of metastatic cells   
On the other hand  for therapeutic virus  interstitial fluid concentration gradients may pose a hurdle as passive diffusion in viable regions  typically the rim  may occur mainly outward   
Given the limited arsenal of known chemicals alleviating tumor compactness and the poor penetration drugs in general into the tumor tissue  this is a considerable problem that may not be easy to tackle 
Some strategies are discussed below Viruses are passive particles and rely either on radial cell to cell spread or on soluble diffusion across concentration gradients to reach their target cells and to propagate the infection 
Tumor matrix is critical in this regard  as it can block both forms of spread 
Passively diffusing viruses may physically not fit through the strands of the ECM 
This was shown for oncolytic herpes virus  which has an outer diameter of over   nm  and whose spreading could be improved by matrix degrading bacterial collagenase co injection   
Bilbao and coworkers showed that adenovirus entry into experimental hepatocellular carcinoma nodules in the livers of immunocompetent rats following intravenous or intraportal injection was directly related to the thickness of the ECM capsule enveloping the nodules   
On the other hand  we found using Semliki Forest virus  which has an outer diameter of about   nm  that even upon intratumoral injection spread was blocked by ECM  which formed a physical barrier for virus infection  Figure  The foremost option to reduce interstitial fluid pressure and to remove physical molecule barriers imposed by the ECM is to use matrix degrading enzymes 
These act by digesting collagen  fibrin  and other types of fibrillar matrix deposits  creating more space between cell clusters  and glycosaminoglycan polymers  known to limit fluid movement in tumors 
Simultaneously  such strategies may also expose more cell surface to viruses  increasing the likelihood of infection 
In a study by Kuriyama  trypsin or collagenase dispase was injected into subcutaneous U  and U  glioma xenografts in immunocompromised mice  followed by a reporter adenovirus   
Both types of ECM degrading enzymes increased tumor transduction by the virus  but when doses got too high  transduction efficacy suffered  demonstrating a balance between ECM degradation and oncolytic virus efficacy 
In another study  treatment of PC  tumors with vaccinia virus producing matrix metalloprotease  MMP    resulted in reduction of collagen IV fibrils and increase in virus penetration into tumor  which yielded elevated virus titers   
Hong et al 
targeted orthotopic neuroblastoma xenografts engineered to express MMP  with oncolytic HSV  achieving increased virus distribution compared to control tumors   
Similar results were obtained when human soft tissue sarcoma HSTS T overexpressing MMP  or MMP  were injected with oncolytic HSV   
MMP expressing tumors contained significantly less sulfated glycosaminoglycans compared to control tumors 
Other enzymes and protein effectors  either engineered into virus expression cassettes or provided exogenously  include hyaluronidase  decorin  various other MMPs  and notably relaxin a peptide hormone normally expressed during particular phase of pregnancy that does not possess tissue degrading activity itself  but instead induces a number of key collagen degrading proteases seemingly in a tumor specific manner   
Beyer showed that relaxin expressed by murine stem cells improved trastuzumab penetrance and therapy outcome in syngeneic tumor models   
In another study  chimeric adenovirus Ad  expressing relaxin showed increased tumor transduction and virus dissemination   Several other strategies to increase penetration of therapeutics in tumors have been developed   
While the stromal ECM capsule of tumor nodules acts as a physical barrier to virus entry following intravenous injection  it was possible to improve tumor infection by administering vaso active compounds  angiotensin II  histamine  nitroglycerine  before the virus   
This is interesting  as vasculature per se would not be expected to alter or influence the physical composition of the ECM  such as collagen strand thickness 
Instead  virus access to the tumor was improved  most likely by increased access from the blood via tumor stromal adjoining vessels 
Interestingly  in a study with oncolytic herpes virus  anti VEGF monoclonal antibody Bevacizumab given before intravenous virus injection gave poorer anti tumor efficacy than when given after the virus   
The study showed that while HSV is able to enter and infect tumors better through their leaky vasculature compared to Bevacizumab normalized vasculature  vascular normalization by Bevacizumab still gave superior combination efficacy when the virus was already in the tumor 
This effect was likely dependent on altering both physical and biological properties of the tumor  including interstitial pressure and oxygenation 
In another study  anti VEGF A antibody injections in nude mice harboring U  human glioma xenografts led to an increase in MMP  expression and reduction in collagen fiber content  facilitating improved distribution of oncolytic adenovirus within the tumor tissue   
In general  targeting tumor vasculature by oncolytic viruses and including agents that affect tumor vasculature in combination regimens is gaining interest    and it will be interesting to see more specific studies on how vascular acting agents may affect the physical barriers to oncolytic viruses Some viruses do not need an extracellular step for propagating infection  such as members of the herpes and poxvirus families  and may be able to spread from cell to cell 
For example  HSV  is able to infect neighboring cells via lateral tight junctions in a manner dependent on its glycoproteins E and I   
Vaccinia virus  on the other hand  induces so called actin tails  which are actin filament driven membranous protrusions of the plasma membrane harboring a single virus particle at the outer tip 
These actin tails actively deliver and deposit virus particles onto or even into neighboring cells   
Because lateral spread without an extracellular step may circumvent neutralizing immunity as well as some of the physical obstacles the tumor microenvironment imposes  this ability has been engineered into viruses that normally do not possess it 
A promising strategy is to engineer OVs to express membrane fusogenic genes  MFGs  such as gibbon ape leukemia virus  GALV  glycoprotein  reptilian reovirus p  protein  FAST  or the membrane glycoproteins H and F of measles virus   
Quite intriguingly  expression of several different MFGs by oncolytic adenovirus synergized with chemotherapy in anti tumor efficacy both in vitro and in vivo    suggesting that membrane fusion facilitated lateral spread of also chemotherapeutics  which otherwise would not have occurred in a compact tumor 
The potential limitation of cell to cell dependent spread  however  may be that membrane free physical barriers  such as the ECM  may still pose a barrier to spread 
Also  it is unclear whether MFGs or other mechanisms of lateral spread may assist in reaching distant tumor nests Some other strategies to alleviate matrix imposed restrictions to oncolytic viruses have been discussed elsewhere   Tumors of epithelial origin mostly retain the firm cellular integrity seen in their original adhesive intercellular configuration 
Several viruses use cellular receptors which are located in paracellular tight junctions  which may be problematic in tightly packed tumors   
Adenovirus C group viruses use coxsackie adenovirus receptor  CAR  as their primary entry point  whereas adenovirus B  group members and measles virus Edmonston use CD  complement binding molecule as their cellular receptor   
Adenovirus B  group  serotypes       and   entry occurs using desmoglein   DSG    
Of these  CAR and DSG  are preferentially located within tight junctions and are hidden from virus binding   
Also the complement receptor CD  was ascribed a role in maintenance of epithelial cell integrity by interactions with the E cadherin catenin network   
These observations imply that before reaching the potential entry site on the tumor cell the virus must find its way into the junctional space 
Moreover  it has become increasingly clear that for example glioma tumors traditionally targeted by Ad  serotype adenoviruses often express only low levels of CAR and instead much higher levels of CD    Beyond that tight junctions hide multiple virus receptors  they contain a network of adhesion molecules  including ZO  cadherins  claudins and occludin  which  if perturbed  is associated with more aggressive disease in many types of cancer   
Since tight junctions also contain important receptors that mediate tumor promoting signaling and which have been targeted by monoclonal antibodies  notably Her  it would be highly useful to develop strategies that temporarily loosen the tight junction contacts even at cost of a transient increase in tumor metastatic risk 
One of the most interesting approaches has been to exploit the natural propensity of adenovirus serotype   which as part of its natural life cycle creates dodecahedral particles  PtDd  consisting of viral capsid proteins  penton base and fiber that open tight junctions by binding to and dissolving desmoglein  dimers and reducing E cadherin expression  to develop a specific tight junction opening molecule  JO    
Adenovirus type   uses PtDds to promote its own infection  opening the tight junctions ahead of infection to maximize access to desmoglein 
Analogously  when administered to human tumor xenografts  JO  facilitated penetration of trastuzumab much deeper into the tumor tissue than when the monoclonal antibody was administered on its own   
Moreover  JO  synergized with several chemotherapeutics in solid tumor models   
Backed by our own findings with oncolytic SFV  showing that both extracellular matrix and tumor cell compactness restrict virus spread and oncolytic efficacy  we believe combination approaches that target both tight junctions and extracellular matrix will prove effective in future virotherapy development  Figure  An alternative approach to increasing tumor penetration by oncolytic viruses is to alter tumor cell morphology and status 
Notably  cell death and in particular the type of cell death induced by virus has been shown to affect virus distribution within a tumor mass  in a study by Nagano et al  administration of apoptosis inducing paclitaxel before injecting oncolytic herpes simplex virus increased virus dissemination in the tumor  allowing its diffuse in  tunnels  created by shrinking dying tumor cells   Maintenance of physiological adherence is essential for proper ECM function and for retaining cellular integrity 
Therefore  a potential caveat of using ECM degrading proteolytic enzymes or tight junction openers is the risk of neoplastic cell detachment from the tumor ECM and increased risk of metastasis 
While ECM degradation or tight junction opening may operate innocuously  there is also a chance that loss of E cadherins via proteases or via non specific deregulation of tight junction integrity during ECM modulating therapy could trigger pro tumorigenic Wnt β catenin signaling  possibly driving epithelial to mesenchymal transition   
One study showed that ectopic relaxin expression stimulated MMP expression and enhanced breast cancer invasiveness    whereas another paper found short term relaxin exposure to increase breast cancer cell motility whereas long term expression reduced both motility and cancer invasiveness   
In the context of oncolytic viruses  Lavilla Alonso tested several proteases  including hyaluronidase  relaxin  and macrophage metalloelastase  and showed they all could assist adenovirus entry into tumors  yet  the authors did not detect treatment induced metastases or increase in tumor invasiveness   
Another strategy possibly balancing some of the putative risks of tight junction disruption could be to use Wnt dependent oncolytic viruses   Tumors are invariably fenestrated by host fibroblasts  myeloid cells and other non transformed cells  which driven by cancer induced cues can adopt various reprogrammed phenotypes to promote tumor angiogenesis and growth and to alter tumor responses to therapies   
As most of them normally play a role in immune homeostasis and pathogen sensing  they also respond to and influence oncolytic virus infection of tumors Fulci et al 
reported that injection of oncolytic HSV  directly into glioblastoma tumor parenchyma triggered upregulation of CD  and CD  monocytic markers and rapid clearance of virus  likely executed by infiltrating phagocytic cells   
When clodronate liposomes were used to deplete macrophages in vivo  the authors observed a  fold increase in virus titers in the brain tumors concomitant with an   reduction in peripheral CD  macrophages in animal spleens  suggesting that CD  cells migrate into the tumors upon virus injection and limit overall oncolytic efficacy 
While CD  cells were not reduced by peripheral macrophage depletion  arguing that these cells had been recruited to the tumors before the treatment  they could be eliminated in live glioma slices ex vivo  resulting in a  fold increase in virus replication 
Macrophages may secrete antiviral type I interferon constitutively at very low  subnanomolar  levels   and recently Liu et al 
showed that tumor resident CD  macrophages induced a protective antiviral state in ovarian and breast tumors which led to resistance to oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus  VSV  infection   
Type I IFN signaling  JAK  inhibitor Ruxolitinib reversed the resistance  facilitating VSV replication in the macrophage protected cancer cells 
It is tempting to speculate that tumor resident macrophages also rendered syngeneic GL  and DBT mouse gliomas completely refractory to VA  oncolytic alphavirus  as these cells were quite infectable in vitro and live glioma slices regained their sensitivity to virus within   h  indicating dilution of IFN I   Macrophages or the closely related myeloid suppressor cells are the predominant stromal cell type in many tumors and are actively recruited during cancer progression   
Heavy macrophage presence in the tumors indicates that such tumors may be resistant to oncolytic virotherapy  unless depleting preconditioning would be used 
Moreover  as part of the early immune response to virus infection  monocytic cells are rapidly recruited to tumors following intratumoral virus injection 
In one study  depletion of either CD b  cells or VEGF secreted by these cells in mice treated with oncolytic HSV  greatly increased oncolytic efficacy  tentatively linking pro tumorigenic and antiviral angiogenic mechanisms   Another key pro tumorigenic signaling employed by many tumors is up regulation of CXCR  the receptor for chemokine CXCL   also known as SDF  and recruitment of stromal cells expressing CXCL  which maintain the tumor and recruit additional cells to support tumor expansion and invasion  such as endothelial cell progenitors which contribute to neovascularization   
Indeed  high CXCR  expression is a negative prognostic factor for many cancers 
Oncolytic vaccinia virus engineered to express a soluble antagonist of CXCR  showed improved intratumoral virus replication  increased vascular disruption and a markedly reduced infiltration of the tumors by putative immune suppressive and tumor promoting stromal cells   
This study highlights how reducing pro tumor stromal cell effects may alleviate antiviral resistance and yield increased overall therapeutic efficacy 
On the other hand  if the paracrine antiviral effects of tumor homing monocytic cells could be selectively abrogated these cells could favorably be used to ferry oncolytic viruses into tumors 
Indeed  a significant delay in metastatic tumor potential was achieved when macrophages were harnessed to deliver a tumor specific oncolytic adenovirus   What is the antiviral status in human cancer 
Recent analyses from different normal cells that occupy the same organ reveal striking functional variation in components of the type I IFN signaling pathway that correlate with the tissue tropism and virulence of some virus strains   
Can similar variation in such components be found in cancer cells  or do cancer cells make an exception Transformed cells undergo selective elimination by the immune system before becoming cancerous  termed immunoediting  based on observations of differential capacity of immunocompetent mice to reject tumors previously grown in immunocompromised hosts versus syngeneic animals   
Cancer cell responsiveness to type I and type II IFNs plays a role during immunoediting  cancer cells that eventually progress to form a tumor display reduced capacity to respond to IFN gamma  which otherwise would upregulate MHC class I molecules and render the tumors amenable to CD  T cell mediated destruction  whereas responsiveness to type I interferon initially helps tumors avoid immune purging during the editing phase and is then irrelevant   
Of note  the anti tumor effects of type I IFN  still exploited today in several cancers  were shown to depend on host NK cells  and mice in which IFNAR was blocked by monoclonal antibody failed to reject even highly immunogenic tumors  as opposed to mice treated with control antibody  who all rejected the immunogenic tumor challenge   
Thus  whereas tumor responsiveness to type I IFN is not predetermined after immunoediting  other factors post immunoediting may influence it In several tumor types  varying levels of expression of components of the type I IFN signaling cascade have been detected  and in some tumor types these components have been found to have prognostic value  whereas in others they do not seem to influence survival   
However  emerging data suggests that antiviral genes may predict poor survival because they increase treatment resistance 
In one study  poor prognosis of several types of cancer due to genotoxic treatment resistance was found to correlate with increased activity of IFN I pathway genes   
In this study  a triad of type I IFN signaling pathway genes  STAT  ISG  and IFIT  formed a pan tumor type negative prognostic factor  and a broader seven gene cluster established negative prognostic criteria for treatment resistant breast cancer 
Treatment resistance was subsequently shown to depend on STAT  signaling  STAT expressing tumor clones were positively selected in animals in vivo  demonstrating increased proliferation and metastatic potential  and STAT expression mediated resistance against genotoxic assault by doxorubicin or ionizing radiation  knockdown of STAT  resulted in lower proliferation rate and metastatic capacity and increased sensitivity to genotoxic stress    
In another study  resistance to epigenetic DNA modifiers  AZA dC  a methyltransferase inhibitor  and LBH  or MGCD  both histone deacetylase  HDAC  inhibitors  was correlated with increased expression of IFN I pathway genes in small lung cancer cells   
Basal IFN related gene expression in several different SML cell lines was upregulated Interestingly  in many cancers  STAT proteins are not phosphorylated and persist in unphosphorylated form  U STAT 
Like its phosphorylated counterpart  U STAT  increases expression of genes contributing to resistance to DNA damaging agents   
While it is currently unknown why cancers may prefer to use unphosphorylated forms  it is known that U STATs activate distinct signals compared to their phosphorylated counterparts 
However  importantly for oncolytic viruses  in many tumors  constant expression and release of type I IFN leads to a constitutively high level of unphosphorylated forms of STAT  STAT  and IRF  which together form an unphosphorylated but functional ISGF like complex that relocalizes to the nucleus and drives expression of a specific set of ISGs distinct from acute IFN I exposure   
These ISGs are sufficient to maintain a functional antiviral defense and they play a critical role in resistance to DNA damaging agents On a cellular level  virus replication is controlled by antiviral defense molecules    which in turn are primarily controlled by type I IFN signaling 
In addition to classical type I IFN  or cytokine induced antiviral signaling  tumors may employ other antiviral defense mechanisms 
For example  stromal cells may secrete peptides with antiviral properties called defensins   
The defensins are amphiphatic and typically  –  amino acids in length and interfere with viruses by physically binding to and disrupting virus particles and or by inducing antiviral responses in target cells via pattern recognition receptors 
At least oral squamous cell carcinomas were found to overexpress defensins compared to normal control tissues   
While the role of defensins in oncolytic virus infection of tumors is unclear  one study showed that the immune stimulating properties of defensins may be exploited to increase overall therapeutic efficacy 
In this study  expression of beta   defensin from a conditionally replicating adenovirus yielded a superior therapeutic entity compared to the unarmed parental virus via enhanced anti tumor immune responses mediated by TLR dependent activation of dendritic cells   In summary  human cancers display varying degrees of expression of antiviral proteins or their signaling regulators at baseline 
Some of these may increase in response to genotoxic anti cancer treatments 
In the next chapter we will highlight some of the consequences to oncolytic virotherapy of the heterogeneity in type I IFN responsiveness in tumor cells All oncolytic viruses tested to date display variable infectivity in different cancer cell lines 
This variability is likely at least partly dependent on type I IFN as most oncolytic viruses are IFN sensitive 
IFN secretion follows virus sensing by the cells via Toll like receptors expressed on both the plasma membrane and in endocytotic vesicles  NOD like receptors  STING  AIM  NLP inflammosome and other danger sensing molecules  summarized elsewhere   
While all viruses carry an arsenal of counteracting molecules    no virus goes completely undetected 
Even HSV amplicons  which are devoid of functional virus genes  induce a type I IFN response that mediates a STAT dependent system wide antiviral defense in mice within one hour of intravenous vector injection  resulting in significant reduction of transgene expression compared to expression in STAT  knockout animals   During our own studies with attenuated SFV vector VA  it became apparent that the dramatic and lasting therapeutic efficacy achieved following mere single intravenous  or intratumoral  injection of the virus in immunocompromised mice bearing human A  melanoma or U  glioma xenografts   was not going to be recapitulated easily in immunocompetent animals   
The paradox in our studies was that while oncolytic SFV vector VA  effectively replicated in and destroyed a variety of IFN responsive cancer cell lines in vitro  it consistently failed to eradicate tumors generated from the same cell types in vivo  even if large doses of virus were injected directly into the tumor mass and even if the tumors were void of visible physical barriers  Figure  
Conversely  only tumors generated from IFN unresponsive cancer cells have seemed infectable in vivo by VA  so far 
In light of earlier findings by others  showing that type I IFN receptor knockout mice are highly susceptible to SFV infection and quickly succumb to multi organ systemic infection    the parameters for oncolytic SFV efficacy seem clear  tumor cells must be defective in type I IFN response for the virus to be effective These findings are in line with emerging data from other groups  showing a remarkably strict dependence of oncolytic virus replication on defective type I IFN responsiveness  a dogma introduced at the turn of the  st century   
For example  sarcomas and melanomas display differing permissiveness to oncolytic VSV  an obstacle which may be overcome by blocking type I IFN signaling   
In eight sarcoma cell lines  basal up regulation of RIG I and IFIT  and rapid induction of STAT  phosphorylation upon IFN I treatment correlated with resistance to oncolytic measles virus   
In other studies  human pancreatic and ovarian cancer cells display resistance against Rb dependent oncolytic adenovirus  strongly correlating with intracellular levels of MxA  and acquired resistance to repeated oncolytic adenovirus injections in an intraperitoneal ovarian carcinoma model was associated with an increase in MxA as well as several other key ISGs in the tumors   
A study comparing normal human or mouse melanocytes to a panel of melanoma cells revealed strong correlation between permissiveness to oncolytic VSV and capacity to mount antiviral defense in response to type I IFN   
In this study  VSV rp  harboring two mutations in P and L genes  was superior to several other tested oncolytic VSV strains  but the dependence on defective IFN responsiveness was still retained 
In yet another study  oncolytic VSV replicated in four out of twelve mesothelioma cell lines which were unable to mount antiviral defense upon IFN beta pretreatment or to respond to infection by up regulation of PKR  MxA or  OAS mRNA   
In contrast  the non permissive mesothelioma cells mounted antiviral defense  associated with PKR  MxA or  OAS mRNA up regulation  in response to infection or to exogenous type I IFN 
The authors of this study further linked the observed pattern of virus resistance to clinical mesothelioma samples  where in a mesothelioma tissue array  significant variance in immunoreactivity against PKR  p  and or IFNAR was observed  with only a few samples displaying lack of reactivity against all three components  arguing that most tumors in clinical settings would display at least some level of resistance to oncolytic VSV Oncolytic adenoviruses are often deleted for E A  which normally binds Rb and prevents it from sequestering E F  which results in the viruses being unable to replicate in normal cells 
However  since adenovirus  as with all viruses  contains elements that antagonize antiviral defenses  such elements have also been targets for deletion to render the virus sensitive to innate antiviral defenses  which would be expected to remain intact only in normal cells 
Cancer cells expressing Ras may down regulate protein kinase R and inhibit type I IFN induction by interfering with RIG I signaling   
Also  select interferon stimulated genes appear to be repressed by the Ras MEK ERK signaling cascade   
PKR activation shuts down E F dependent translation  including translation of virus messenger RNAs 
Therefore  an adenovirus deleted for VA RNA  which antagonizes PKR  should be capable of replicating in Ras overexpressing  tumor  cells 
However  while this was seemingly the case    it was later discovered that Ras is not an obligatory determinant for PKR inactivation and that virus replication was halted even in Ras overexpressing cells via functional PKR mediated E F phosphorylation  implying that the parameters of VA RNA deleted adenovirus replication had to be revised   
Similar findings were obtained with oncolytic reovirus  against which Ras independent tumor resistance emerged in vivo   
Thus  under some circumstances even tumor cells over expressing Ras may respond to type I IFN or to stimulants of pattern recognition receptors  activating PKR and inhibiting virus translation 
To complicate matters  MEK inhibitors have been shown restore antiviral signaling capacity in Ras overexpressing tumors   
This implies that human tumors treated with MEK inhibitors  such as Trametinib which was recently approved for treatment of BRAF mutated melanoma  may be poor targets for oncolytic viruses as antiviral signaling capacity in such tumors may be restored Some oncolytic viruses  such as members of the poxvirus family  are seemingly resistant to the antiviral effects of type I IFNs in vitro and may be controlled by other cellular factors   
However  in most cases  sensitivity or resistance to type I IFN is assessed in vitro and using only one cytokine  which may mask synergies with other factors present in vivo 
One possible explanation for the in vitro–in vivo discrepancy is the tumor micro environment  which not only imposes physical barriers to oncolytic viruses but also alters intracellular antiviral defenses 
For example  glioma cells were found in the brain to spontaneously secrete type I IFN  which conferred resistance against oncolytic HSV 
Resistance was linked to ECM protein CCN  interaction with glioma cell surface receptor alpha   beta   integrin  which activated interferon secretion   
It is tempting to speculate whether this or a similar ECM glioma interaction could have contributed to the resistance of syngeneic glioma cells we observed in vivo but not in vitro to both oncolytic SFV and vaccinia virus  FIG    
Also  while critical in many respects  antiviral signaling may occur without signaling via type I IFN receptor  IFNAR 
For instance  upon infection of IFNAR KO mice with murine hepatitis virus  MHV  brain cells were found to have upregulated antiviral GTPase TGTP and IFITm  and IFITm  all of which have confirmed antiviral activity in vivo against a variety of viruses   
In these cases  IFN gamma and TNF alpha likely account for at least part of the observed ISG activity  where e g  TGTP is upregulated by IFN γ signaling and TNFα has been shown to induce ISG  independently of IFNAR   Interestingly  while most cancers are heterogeneous in antiviral defence signaling  one broad class of tumors in particular may display consistently low capacity to ward off oncolytic viruses  oncovirus induced cancers 
This is because oncoviruses  as all viruses  carry a complement of factors that abrogate antiviral sensors and effectors  which may result in tumors that are uniformly devoid of antiviral signaling 
In an intriguing study  oncolytic VSV infected and destroyed human papilloma virus  HPV positive cervical carcinoma cells more effectively than HPV negative head  and neck cancer cells due to HPV E mediated suppression of antiviral signaling   
HPV positive or E expressing xenografts were efficiently eradicated from nude mice following VSV injection 
The potential of this approach is that even oncolytic viruses that are extremely sensitive to type I IFN  such as attenuated SFV or M mutated VSV  may function well against oncovirus induced cancers where the oncovirus machinery ensures the lack of antiviral defense While on first thought it would appear counterintuitive to antagonize the very factors that keep oncolytic viruses tumor specific  emerging data shows that this can be accomplished in a safe way 
One of the foremost strategies to increase oncolytic virus efficacy is to combine them with drugs that lower tumor antiviral defenses 
In this regard  a primary target for interference is the prototypical type I IFN signaling cascade 
While small molecular inhibitors against IFNAR are not available  activity of downstream signaling transducers may effectively be blocked 
Human pancreatic cancer cells were shown to constitutively express high levels of MxA and OAS and to mount type I IFN dependent resistance to oncolytic VSV 
Resistance could be overcome by blocking activity of IFNAR associated Janus kinase  JAK      
Similarly  JAK  inhibitor ruxolitinib overcame type I IFN dependent resistance of human SCC  head and neck cancer cells against oncolytic VSV   
Ruxolitinib also successfully abrogated type I IFN mediated antiviral effects elicited by macrophages    highlighting that this drug might also alleviate type I IFN dependent tumor resistance to oncolytic viruses imposed by stromal cells 
However  the obvious downside to using JAK inhibitors is their effects on critical host defense mechanisms  which may result in increased infection of normal cells 
Moreover  JAK inhibitors may reduce anti tumor immune responses elicited by oncolytic virotherapy 
For example  ruxolitinib was shown to impair the capacity of dendritic cells promote CD  T cell responses against model tumor antigens   
On the other hand  in this study clearance of adenovirus was delayed in ruxolitinib treated normal animals  which makes it difficult to predict the overall impact of JAK inhibitors on tumor therapy where prolonged virus presence might translate to better therapeutic efficacy 
Also  while the immune stimulating and anti tumor effects of type I and type II interferons may be adversely affected by JAK inhibitors  central tumor promoting cascades mediated by JAKs  such as IL STAT  may also be inhibited    yielding a difficult to predict net therapeutic outcome 
At the moment  more studies are needed to establish the overall impact of interference with JAK  signaling in cancer therapy Spurred by earlier reports of oncovirus reactivation and promoter enhancement by histone deacetylase  HDAC  inhibitors  this class of agents was assessed for capacity to enhance oncolytic virus potency by inhibiting antiviral responses 
Indeed  such enhancement was observed with oncolytic VSV and SFV  and while it has been difficult to pinpoint the exact mechanisms that underlie HDAC inhibitor enhancement of oncolytic virus replication in cancer cells  antiviral defenses in general are inhibited for yet unknown reasons mainly in cancer cells and not in normal cells  which indirectly facilitates virus replication   
Interestingly  combination of HDAC inhibitors with conditionally replicating   E A deleted adenovirus gave improved virus replication rate and therapeutic efficacy in subcutaneous xenograft models only when the inhibitors were given before the virus  otherwise inhibition of replication was observed   
Similarly  HDAC inhibitors increased replication and oncolytic efficacy of HSV when given before the virus but not when given at the same time   
With nuclear DNA viruses  such as adenovirus and HSV  it is possible that HDAC inhibitors also alter virus genome accessibility to transcription factors  resulting in reduced replication or other adverse effects  implying that with these viruses HDAC inhibitors should be administered before the viruses Recently  it was found that HDAC inhibitor vorinostat activates NfκB signaling by facilitating hyperacetylation of the p  subunit  which in turn activates cellular autophagy   
Autophagy was in another study shown to be important for VSV replication  presumably by inhibiting antiviral signaling 
This is interesting  as a previous study revealed enhancement of VSV replication by inhibiting TNF alpha induced antiviral signaling mediated by p  using NfκB inhibitors BMS  or TPCA    
In this study  neither inhibitor had an effect on STAT  or STAT  phosphorylation or their nuclear relocalization in response to type I IFN but the authors observed clear induction of ISG  GBP  and MX  in response to type I IFN in U  glioma cells  with the latter two being dependent on NfκB signaling 
Taken together  NfκB pathway activation may result in different antiviral responses in different cancer types  and inhibition or enhancement of oncolytic viruses by NfκB inhibitors is dependent on other concomitant cellular mechanisms  such as autophagy Since HDAC inhibitors modulate promoter activity accessibility  it is conceivable other epigenetic or promoter modifying agents could work in a similar manner to repress antiviral defense induction and enhance oncolytic viruses   
DNA demethylating agents  azacytidine  Aza  and decitabine synergized with oncolytic herpes simplex type   virus in glioma models in vitro and in vivo  as did HDAC inhibitor valproic acid  VPA  which was already shown before to work well with oncolytic HSV as well as several other oncolytic viruses   
Moreover  inhibition of cancer antiviral defenses  specifically RNAseL and PKR  resulted when cancer cells were exposed to sunitinib  a multi tyrosine kinase inhibitor originally developed as an inhibitor of VEGF R and PDGF R signaling  yielding strong anti tumor synergy with IFN sensitive oncolytic VSV   
Since sunitinib is approved for renal cell carcinoma and imatinib resistant gastric cancers  combination with oncolytic VSV constitutes a promising and clinically relevant approach warranting further investigation 
Interstingly  sunitinib as well as several other receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors displayed antiviral effects against polyomavirus BK    arguing that these compounds are not universal virus enhancers Cyclophosphamide  CPA  is a general immunosuppressant used to minimize Treg presence during immunotherapy and also oncolytic virotherapy 
CPA may  however  also enhance replication and efficacy of oncolytic viruses by diminishing cytokine secretion by stromal cells  including type I IFN   
Another compound enhancing oncolytic virus efficacy by lowering cell responsiveness to type I IFN is triptolide  which acts downstream of IRF  activation   
Further  the kinase mammalian target of rapamycin  mTOR  enhances the antiviral effects of type I IFN by activation of its effector proteins  E BP  which binds and inactivates translation factor eIF E  and S K  which carries out cell type specific signaling functions of type I IFN  such as activation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor  B and promotion of ISG  transcription 
Consequently  rapamycin was able to enhance oncolytic VSV replication and anti tumor efficacy by inhibiting type I IFN mediated antiviral signaling via mTOR   Several other compounds synergizing with oncolytic viruses have been identified via high throughput drug library screening  many of which seem to act by antagonizing antiviral defenses 
For instance  a novel virus sensitizer  Vse  was found to greatly diminish antiviral effects of type I IFN against oncolytic VSV in several cancer cell types  and the drug also synergized with the virus in subcutaneous mouse tumor models   
For many of these new compounds  the mechanism of action is still poorly understood  necessitating extensive safety studies to exclude undesirable effects against normal cells Apart from classical type I IFN induced antiviral defenses  which typically prevent virus translation and degrade virus genomes  other cellular machineries regulate oncolytic virus efficacy 
Notably  strategies to increase cancer cell death in response to oncolytic viruses have been tested 
In a recent study  a class of compounds called SMAC mimetics synergized in several cancer models with oncolytic VSV by removing cancer cell block to apoptosis in response to virus induced type I IFN  TNF α or TRAIL   
Interestingly  since virus infection triggered cytokines act on nearby non infected cells  SMAC mimetics may in combination with oncolytic viruses also cause significant bystander tumor destruction 
Normal cells are not affected by the IFN SMAC mimetic synergy  providing an important safety aspect 
In another study  blocking the ER stress response circuitry triggered by oncolytic rhabdovirus infection by a small molecular inhibitor of serine threonine protein kinase and endoribonuclease IRE α  which was identified in a genome wide siRNA screen  greatly enhanced cytotoxicity via caspase induced apoptosis and increased oncolytic efficacy in refractory tumor models in mice   
This effect was independent on induction or responsiveness to type I IFN 
Conversely  inhibitors of nucleoside transporter   ENT  were discovered from a high throughput screen of enhancers of oncolytic HSV  and to date such inhibitors have not been reported to alter cellular antiviral responses   
Other compounds  such as common chemotherapeutics  and their mechanisms synergizing with oncolytic viruses have been discussed elsewhere for most of them the possible role of antiviral defense antagonism in enhancing oncolytic virus efficacy remains to be studied   Thus  many compounds are available to interfere with tumor antiviral defenses 
The outstanding question for most of them  however  seems to be why such compounds do not render normal cells sensitive to oncolytic viruses 
Elucidation of the exact mechanisms of action and the differences between normal and cancer cells constitute a worthy goal for studies in the near future Already in the  s it became clear that using certain pathogenic wildtype viruses  such as West Nile virus and Bunyamwera virus  in cancer patients would result in off target toxicity   
Characteristic for pathogenic viruses is a greater ability to circumvent or antagonize cellular innate antiviral defenses than attenuated strains 
For example  unlike the prototypical oncolytic reovirus strain type   Dearing  the T L strain of reovirus causes accumulation of IRF  in the nucleus and inhibits activation of a select group of ISGs yet because of this property the T L strain is myocarditic unlike the oncolytic type   Dearing strain   
For these reasons  many oncolytic viruses used today  such as reovirus type   Dearing  oncolytic strains of Newcastle disease virus and M mutated VSV have either a stronger capacity to induce or a weaker capacity to resist antiviral type I IFN than the corresponding wildtype strains   An open question  however  is whether strain specific or virus specific differences that relate to specific components of the cellular antiviral machinery may be exploited for greater anti tumor efficacy  i e  if one virus fails  could another be used in its stead 
While Ras expression was critical for oncolytic reovirus replication in cells overexpressing CUG  oncogene  oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus was unable to replicate in the same cells due to increased activation of STAT  and OASL    
Thus  in these cells reovirus was not affected by STAT  or OASL  and it therefore remains interesting to see which other antiviral effectors may have been lacking in the CUG expressing cells and  conversely  how reovirus and VSV differ in terms of sensitivity to antiviral effectors 
While several oncolytic viruses have been compared to each other in terms of replication rate and cytotoxicity  systematic studies with regard to tumor antiviral defenses have not been conducted As any attenuated virus is likely to replicate effectively only in its own niche  i e  to be restricted by a specific set of ISGs  and as wild type strains may be too toxic for use in humans  a compromise may be achieved by incorporating select elements from wild type viruses into oncolytic virus backbones 
Indeed  several chimeric and recombinant viruses have been generated that harbor specific elements of wild type strains or even of other unrelated viruses in order to better resist cancer antiviral defenses  Table  
As an example of introducing wild type elements into attenuated viruses  Haralambieva reported on a measles virus Edmonston vaccine strain in which P gene was replaced with the counterpart from the wild type IC B strain   
Later  Meng et al 
included N  P  and L genes from wild type measles in Edmonston backbone  producing an enhanced but still safe oncolytic virus   
Edmonston vaccine virus induces a more robust IFN response compared to wild type measles virus partly due to the weaker ability of V protein to suppress MDA mediated activation of IRF  and IFN I induction   
In vivo  P gene encoded proteins  particularly V  control the quality of the cytokine response to measles so that vaccine strains qualitatively induce a stronger inflammatory response compared to WT strains  where WT V protein suppresses multiple cytokine secretion 
V protein short cytoplasmic tail has been shown to bind and inactivate STAT  IRF  MDA  and the Rel homology domain of the NfκB subunit p  but not of p    
Also  V causes LGP  protein to bind and inactivate RIG I    but it seemingly does not interfere with TICAM   TRIF  multiple TLR adaptor  including TLR mediated IFN β induction 
Thus  if cancer and normal cells would differ with regard to TICAM  or IRF  then such a virus could potentially target specifically cancer cells rather than normal cells 
So far  the measles Edmonston WT chimeras have proven safe in animals As an example of heterologous virus constructs  lentogenic Newcastle disease virus engineered to express influenza virus PR   H N  NS  showed enhanced oncolytic efficacy in vivo due to dampening of antiviral responses   
While such a virus did not display enhanced pathogenicity in that study  a mesogenic NDV virus harboring NS  from influenza strain H N  did show increased pathogenicity in chickens as well as an increased ability to replicate in human cells    raising some cautionary warnings for future engineering of similar replicative viruses 
As another example  vaccinia virus soluble type I IFN scavenger B R  NOTE  B R is often used in the literature  has been engineered into both oncolytic HSV and oncolytic rhabdoviruses  resulting in all cases in more effective therapy agents without loss of tumor specificity   
Oncolytic γ  gene deleted HSV was complemented by two different PKR antagonists from human cytomegalovirus  TRS  and IRS  generating a chimera capable of reaching wild type virus replication levels in cancer cells in vitro and in tumor models in vivo   The selection of various viral IFN I antagonists that potentially could be used to augment attenuated oncolytic viruses is vast   
For example  increased replication of several viruses  including HIV  Sindbis virus and E deleted adenovirus in mammalian cells was observed when the cells were engineered to express vaccinia virus E L protein  influenza A virus NS  protein  ebola virus VP  protein or HIV  Tat protein   
The choice of antagonist must primarily be made with safety in mind  but virus specific and cell specific differences in antagonist functions may potentially be exploited rationally when considering the overall combination 
For example  vaccinia virus E L is able to rescue VSV but not EMCV from exogenous IFN  whereas vaccinia virus K L partially rescued EMCV but not VSV   In anticipation of systematic  perhaps bioinformatically guided   super chimera  studies  two or more viruses that may complement each other s shortcomings in antiviral defense antagonism have been considered 
Notably  vaccinia virus was favorably combined with IFN I sensitive oncolytic VSV and SFV  yielding tumor model dependent increases in overall therapy efficacy that were dependent on vaccinia virus antagonism of type I IFN responses  which increased the replication of the IFN sensitive viruses   
Such heterologous virotherapy approaches may also be used to generate immunological synergy  similar to heterologous prime boost vaccination  anti tumor immune responses may be increased due to targeting of the tumor by two different viruses  on two separate occasions  but anti virus immune responses would be generated against different viruses each time  avoiding the problem of neutralizing immunity to and predominance of antivirus immune responses   
Some other ideas explored experimentally include engineering oncolytic viruses to express other oncolytic viruses 
For example  the entire oncolytic parvovirus H  genome was placed under a regulatable promoter in oncolytic adenovirus  resulting in a more effective therapeutic entity than either virus alone without loss of tumor specificity   
The genetic material of Semliki Forest virus replicons has been engineered into adenovirus and vaccinia virus backbones   and several other virus chimeras have been constructed   
However  the effects on tumor antiviral defenses of such a constructs remain to be studied The attribute  oncolytic  implies for a virus that it infects and  indeed  lyses the infected tumor 
This property is primarily tested in vitro in cultured tumor cells 
We have learned  however  that in the native tumor microenvironment in living hosts many viruses are no longer able to infect tumor cells or to kill them even if they manage to infect them 
Tightly packed tumor cells and the network of supportive molecules of the extracellular matrix form a physical barrier to virus particle diffusion 
It has also become evident that the tumor cells themselves may be much more capable of thwarting oncolytic virus advances than previously thought  with some tumor cells residing in a seemingly permanent non permissive antiviral state 
Tumors harbor multiple cell types in addition to the neoplastic cells  which may promote and propagate both physical and cellular virus resistance 
As the efficacy of virotherapy in human cancer patients still falls shy of the achievements in animal models  it appears quite plausible that one or more of the barriers described in this review indeed constitute a real and formidable obstacle for oncolytic virus advancement into routine clinical use 
Fortunately  some of the most difficult barriers have been identified  and a rapidly expanding arsenal of countermeasures is at our disposal 
Our task is now to separate the wheat from the chaff and to systematically evaluate the proposed combination regimens that will yield the best results without compromising patient safety Evidence of prenatal toxicity of herbal based indigenous formulations for sex selection in rat modelsTraditional or indigenous preparations  IPs  are getting considerable attention in global health debates  It continues to be used widely in several countries and its consumption is rapidly increasing 
 
  Many reports have documented the use of such preparations 
For instance  in China  traditional herbal medicines played a critical role during the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome  SARS  In fact  many drugs in modern medicine had their roots in the traditional system of medicine 
Drugs like Penicillin  from Penicillium fungi  and Digoxin  from Digitalis purpurea  are some such examples 
One of the promising therapies for Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus  MRSA  infection is a ninth century treatment for eye infections which is a recipe consisting of garlic and onions  wine  and bile from a cow s stomach brewed in a brass cauldron 
It is however important to note that culture specific practices are not always safe 
Digitalis is a classic example where herbalists use this plant in allopathic treatment strategies  while in some countries such as Britain  law restricts their vast availability  A report from Australia describes the adverse effects of ‘herbal  preparations or IPs  Problems arise when people do not report about the consumption of such preparations assuming that these are devoid of any side effects by virtue of them being natural products  The need for research in this field is huge and scientific research into the quality  safety  molecular effects and clinical efficacy is crucial 
 
 
Pregnancy is considered a time of minimal intervention  and a period when herbal medicines are usually contraindicated  It is reported that many women consume indigenous medicines  that contains Bryonia laciniosa  Quercus infectoria and Putranjiva roxburghii along with other ingredients  during early pregnancy to beget a male child in India 
These preparations  often called sex selection drugs  SSD  contain herbal ingredients but these are off the label prescriptions and hence cannot be certified as ‘herbal  medicines 
The prevalence of consumption varies from   to as high as         Studies have indicated that there is  –  times higher risk of birth defects including major malformations of internal organs like urogenital and renal malformation  trachea esophageal fistula  and visible defects like spina bifida  cleft lip palate and imperforate anus 
 
  Risk of stillbirths also increases   folds 
Studies suggest that a single exposure during pregnancy can be deleterious 
 
 
 
  SSDs are reported to contain phytoestrogens  steroids and heavy metals 
 
 
 
  It is also known that although placenta serves as a barrier  most drugs and environmental chemicals enter the foetal circulation by passive diffusion or active transport  However  despite growing evidence on deleterious effects of these herbal formulations  few studies have attempted to systematically understand the risk of such preparations using animal models 
Genetic sex of a child is determined at the time of conception by the fertilization of the ovum with X or Y sperms and intake of so called preparations for sex selection can never alter that In view of these  the current study was conducted with an objective to determine the embryo foetal and development toxicity of SSDs following maternal exposure during critical period of organogenesis using a small animal model The study was guided by the OECD guidelines for testing of chemicals  Guideline no    adopted on  nd January   Prenatal Developmental Toxicity Study  and was based on a mutually approved protocol 
Personal protection equipment was employed as required while handling the test system The test facility is registered and renewed  No 
 PO RcBi S CPCSEA dated July     for breeding and to conduct research on animals for commercial purpose by the committee for the purpose of control and supervision of experiments on animals  CPCSEA  Ministry of Environment  Forests and Climate Change  Government of India 
The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee  Venus Medicine Research Center 
Due permission was taken from the Ethics Committee of Indian Institute of Public Health Delhi For this experiment  strain of Sprague Dawley of rats  Rattus norvegicus  was used 
The number of dams per group was   instead of   as laid down under OECD guidelines 
Rats of both sexes  –  g  were obtained from National Institute of Biologicals  India at  –  weeks of age  acclimatized for five days and then subjected to the experiment at  –  weeks of age 
They were housed in standard polypropylene rat cages with stainless steel top grill  one dam per cage  at a temperature of       °C  with  –  relative humidity 
Bedding material and cages were changed once in six days and   hourly light dark cycle was followed 
Animals were identified by their existing ear numbering 
Cages were labelled by tags indicating the study number  sex  group of the animals  experimental start and completion dates 
Standard pelleted feed  from Ashirwad Industries  Mohali  India  was provided ad libitum to all the animals 
They also had free access to purified water via drinking bottles throughout the study 
The feed  cages and drinking bottles were not analysed for the presence of phytoestrogens and bisphenol A 
However  similar materials were used for all the rats across all groups The drug comprised of IPs for sex selection  SSD 
These non branded locally made preparations are made available  –  days after placing an order and are never sold openly 
These preparations essentially contain herbal ingredients such as Shivlingi  Bryonia laciniosa  Majuphal  Quercus infectoria  Putrajeevak  Putranjiva roxburghii  Nagkesar  Mesua ferrea  and feather of peacock  Pavo cristatus 
A total of   such samples of SSDs were procured from varied sources like ‘pansari  shop owners  grocers  local alternative medicine practitioners  rickshaw pullers  drivers and commoners from different states 
SSDs are advised to be consumed between   and   weeks of pregnancy The samples were categorized into   groups based on redundancy of the preparations and common ingredients reported 
This was followed by chemical analysis in an accredited laboratory to detect the presence of phytoestrogens and steroids 
Since we explored the toxic effects of these preparations we wanted to select two samples that would be most predictive of toxicity 
Due to resource constraints  we did not want to subject all the   samples for animal study 
Hence  three samples of SSDs  found to be most rich in phenols and steroids were selected for toxicity study  All the three samples were also tested for heavy metals which suggested that Lead and Mercury were in very high quantities  The toxicity was examined using C  elegans  an alternate animal model 
Survival analysis and reproductive toxicity was assessed from the brood size and progeny count assay  The two SSDs that were found to be most toxic were selected as test items for the subsequent study in rat models 
SSD   was reported to contain Shivlingi and Putrajeevak while SSD   contained Shivlingi  Majuphal  Putrajeevak  Nagkesar and feathers of peacock 
Both the samples were obtained from grocers 
Local preparations like these are bound to have certain degree of variability in concentrations but more often than not  these remain the major ingredients According to studies reported  women consume such preparations along with cow s milk in dosages and schedule that are quite varied 
While some advise these IPs to be consumed for one day  others prescribe it for   days  to be taken thrice a day 
We considered the amount of SSDs most commonly reported by pregnant women  weighing   kg  which was  –  g daily for   days 
The dose of the test item   mg kg  was calculated by using conversion factor of  Conversion factor is the ratio of the correction factors  estimated by dividing the average body weight in kgs of species by the body surface area in m  of the species  Km 
Human equivalent dose  HED in mg kg    Animal dose  mg kg  X correction factor  Km animal Km human 
Kms of every species are constant 
For humans it is    assuming average weight of adults to be   kg a surface area of   m  and for rats it is  Therefore  HED   mg  kg    animal dose X  
Or  animal dose         mg kg           mg kg Since pregnant women consume these orally  these were administered to rats by oral route The test items were coded as SSD   and SSD   and were provided to the experimental laboratory  Venus Medicine Research Center  Baddi  in powder form 
On the day of dosing  the doses were administered between  –  h  The test items were administered in fresh cow s milk at a final volume of   ml kg 
The doses were calculated on the basis of the latest body weight recorded for the study 
A stainless steel gavage cannula fitted to a calibrated syringe was used for dosing the animals For control animals  cow s milk was used as a vehicle while feeding The study was performed in two phases to evaluate the effect of SSD consumption duration during gestation period Adult  nulliparous female rats were mated with males of same species and strain in  
Each morning  dams were examined for the presence of a vaginal plug and vaginal smear was taken from each dam by using pipette smear technique 
The day of vaginal plug formation or sperms observed in vaginal smear  also known as successful mating  were considered as GD   Gestation day  
The mated females were housed individually in clear polycarbonate cages with stainless steel wire lids 
Mating process was carried out to result in   pregnant animals per group 
Successfully mated females were randomized into control and treatment groups 
All the rats were sacrificed on GD  
According to OECD guidelines  the test chemical should be administered daily from implantation to the day prior to scheduled caesarean section in order to assess toxicity 
Test chemicals were administered to pregnant animals and sacrificed as per the schedule  which was as close as possible to the normal day of delivery without risking loss of data resulting from early delivery i e GD  
The females were killed  before caesarean section  the uterine contents were examined  and the fetuses were evaluated for soft tissue and skeletal changes The pregnant rats were randomized to two intervention and one control groups 
SSD was given during pre implantation to implantation stage  GD  – 
Each group of rats was treated either with vehicle  G  VC  SSD   G    mg kg  or SSD   G    mg kg SSDs were given from GD  – 
Each group of rats was treated with either vehicle or SSD  or SSD 
Allocation of animals was randomized to the following groups  G   Control  VC  G   SSD    mg kg  G   SSD    mg kg  G   SSD    mg kg  G   SSD    mg kg  G SSD    mg kg  G   SSD    mg kg The following parameters were observed •Clinical Signs  Animals were observed once after successful mating or on GD  and after administration of the first dose 
Cage side observations for clinical signs of toxicity in the animals were recorded once daily until the day before necropsy •Body weight  Body weight of all experimental animals were recorded once before mating  initial body weight  and then after confirmation of mating 
Body weights were recorded on days               and on terminal day before sacrifice 
These recorded body weights were used for calculating the dose volume to be administered •Food consumption  Food consumption was evaluated once after successful mating or on day   of gestation  the day of vaginal plug formation or sperms observed in vaginal smear  and on days             and one day prior to sacrifice 
Calculated amount of feed were placed in the trough of each cage and the quantity of feed remaining after approximately   h were weighed and recorded •Morbidity Mortality  All the animals were observed twice daily  once in the morning between   and   h and once in the evening between   and   h  for incidence of morbidity and or mortality •Maternal examination related parameters  At the end of the observation period  all the dams were sequentially euthanized  by CO  asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation  and subjected to gross necropsy 
After termination  dams were examined macroscopically for any structural abnormalities or pathological changes 
Blinding was done while evaluation of the dams during caesarean section and subsequent foetal analyses to minimize bias 
Pregnancy rate was calculated as the proportion of mated pairs that had produced at least one pregnancy within a fixed period where pregnancy was determined by the earliest available evidence that fertilization has occurred 
Gestation index was calculated to indicate number of females with live born as a proportion of number of females with evidence of pregnancy •Examination of uterine contents  Immediately after termination  the uteri were removed and the pregnancy status of the animals ascertained 
Gravid uteri including the cervix were weighed  and number of corpora lutea were determined 
The uterine contents were examined for numbers of embryonic or foetal deaths and live foetuses 
The degree of resorption was described in order to estimate the relative time of death of the conceptus 
Any increase in the number of resorption and or implantation loss is an indicator of litter size for the individual dam •Examination of foetuses  The sex and weight of each foetus were determined 
Approximately one half of each litter were prepared and examined for skeletal alterations from selected dams 
The remainder were prepared and examined for soft tissue alterations  using accepted or appropriate serial sectioning methods or careful gross dissection techniques 
Each foetus was examined for external alterations 
Foetuses were examined for skeletal alterations  using Alizarin Red S staining method 
The fetuses for skeletal staining were kept in pre labelled plastic containers containing   ethanol before staining 
After skinning  we processed the foetus for staining by immersing in   alcian blue   GX for three days  then performed rehydration through a gradient series of ethanol   ethanol   –  h twice    ethanol   –  h  ethanol   –  h  distilled water until the samples sank to the bottom of a conical tube 
Samples were further treated with   KOH for  –  days or until it became clear and again treated with   alizarin red for next  –  days until bones became purple 
Samples were rinsed   times in   KOH  for  –  h at each time point 
Samples were further treated with a gradient series of glycerol  KOH    h   glycerol   h X  Visceral examination was done by micro dissection technique 
Fetuses were preserved in   formalin until they became fixed 
An illuminated magnifier was used for visceral examination 
We placed the foetus in a supine position on a paraffin wax block tray covered with paraffin wax  secured the fetal limbs by paper pins to the paraffin wax block  made a ventral midline incision from the umbilicus  cutting caudally to the genital tubercle and cranially to the diaphragm 
Once incision was completed  we located the ventral attachment of the diaphragm and lifted the liver carefully to examine the diaphragm for abnormal opening 
After observation  the diaphragm was clipped 
We gave a longitudinal cut to open the rib cage slightly lateral to and on the right of the sternebrae and then extended the cut anteriorly to neck region 
The rib cage was opened gently and secured to the paraffin block petridish tray with pins Foetuses were examined for soft tissue alterations  e g 
variations and malformations or anomalies  using Wilson s Technique 
The fetal viscera were examined sequentially  beginning with thoracic organs and moving caudally 
We performed hearts cuts after completion of other observations 
We examined the bilobed thymus for size  shape  coloration and presence of haemorrhages and then removed it for observation of trachea and esophagus 
We observed the lungs for size  color and number of lobes  observed the trachea  esophagus for normal alignment and presence of fistula  opened the pericardial sac and cut off pericardium to expose the heart for observation 
We checked the size  shape  color of the heart and normal development of major blood vessels 
After observation of thoracic viscera  we observed the abdominal viscera and liver for size  shape  color  texture  and number of lobes 
External anatomy of heart was examined by making two incisions using micro dissecting scissors We examined the stomach  spleen  pancreas  small and large intestines for size  position or any other developmental anomalies 
The intestines were moved aside after observation for seeing the underlying structures 
Ureters were checked for normal size and location and for continuity from the renal hilus to the urinary bladder 
One kidney was cut transversely and another was longitudinally to examine renal papilla and renal pelvis 
To confirm the sex of the foetus  the gonads were inspected carefully 
We examined the reproductive organs for size  shape and location GraphPad Prism® statistical software version   was used to analyze the data and all the results were represented as mean   S E M 
Intergroup variance for most of the parameters was calculated by one way analysis of variance  ANOVA  followed by Tukey s test 
A value of p     was regarded statistically significant 
Linear regression was performed to examine the weight change of dams during pregnancy for each group comparing with the control after adjusting for the litter size 
The malformations were analysed by performing Chi square test for trend for two groups  SSD  G  G  G  G  and SSD  G  G  G  G The ARRIVE guidelines were followed to report the findings 
In phase   pre natal study  all the dams dosed with SSD  and SSD  had normal food intake and weight gain 
The average gain in weight from GD  to GD   was       gms for controls while it was       gms in SSD   and       gms in SSD 
 Webtable  
No test item related mortality or clinical sign of toxicity was encountered during the study 
All dams in treatment groups and control group survived to scheduled terminal sacrifice 
They showed normal behaviour until euthanized 
There were no differences in mean maternal body weights  body weight gains  pregnancy rate  gestational index  pre and post implantation loss  and resorptions 
No significant differences were observed in foetal sex ratio  foetal body weights 
However  one dam from SSD  had all male foetuses 
No abnormality was detected in skeletal and visceral examination In phase   controls and SSD  and SSD  treated dams exhibited a comparable food intake  Table  
 
However  a dose response relationship was observed with reduced weight gain with higher doses of SSDs 
 Table  
 
Two dams  one in G   SSD    mg kg  and the other in G   SSD    mg kg  categories showed decreased or consistent body weight GD  onwards 
On an average  the weight on GD   was       gms in controls while it was       with SSD    mg kg  and       gms with SSD    mg kg 
The adjusted analysis indicated that except in G  there was a significant reduction in weight gain in all the intervention groups as compared to the control group after controlling for litter size  Table  
 During follow up  one dam from SSD    mg kg  and one from SSD    mg kg  showed haematuria during gestational day  – 
However  no another clinical sign of toxicity was encountered during the study 
All the dams in treatment and control groups showed normal behaviour and survived to scheduled terminal sacrifice 
In phase   pregnancy rate and gestational index were found to be   at all dose levels with SSD  whereas  in SSD  it decreased to   in G   SSD    mg kg  and G   SSD    mg kg  groups 
One dam from G   SSD    mg kg  and another one from G   SSD    mg kg  group showed mating confirmation during vaginal smear examination and showed positive sign in initial days of pregnancy but during necropsy on expected day of delivery  GD   no foetus was found 
Body weights of dams increased in the initial stages that became constant at a later period 
To reconfirm it  non gravid uterus was stained in salewski strain and presence of conceptus was found 
This indicated the possibility of miscarriage Increased pre and post implantation losses as well as resorptions and reduced live foetuses were observed with both SSD  and SSD 
No significant differences were observed in foetal sex ratio  but decreased foetal body weights were noted in both sexes 
On an average one early resorption in a group was a normal observation 
More than one late resorption was observed in all treatment groups while there was none in the control group 
Total count of live foetuses count was significantly reduced with SSD  and SSD  treatment in a dose dependent manner 
Total number of live foetuses were reduced up to   in SSD  at   mg kg treatment group and   in SSD  at   mg kg treatment group Both SSD  and SSD s at different dose levels showed decreased fetal weight in dose dependent manner  although the difference was not significant 
Skeletal and soft tissue alterations were observed in both treatment groups 
In general  the embryo–foetal examination showed abnormalities  which could have caused some functional damage to these foetuses if allowed to grow in the normal course 
In visceral examinations  slight dilation of the renal pelvis  reduced papilla size  urinary bladder hypertrophy was observed in few foetuses from both SSD  and SSD  treatment groups 
Few incidences of foetal soft tissue abnormalities encountered in this study were normal variants 
Skeletal examination showed variations in the ossification patterns like incomplete or poorly ossified skulls  ossification of sternebra  cleavage ossification of thoracic centrum  asymmetric thoracic centrum  and supernumerary rib in many foetuses in SSD  and SSD  groups  Table  
 
A trend was noted with increased incidence of certain malformations with increasing dosages of SSDs that was statistically significant for most malformations with SSD The results of this developmental toxicity study suggest that administration of SSDs to pregnant rats had significant impact on intrauterine foetal growth  early and late resorption as well as developmental anomalies 
These formulations have teratogenic potential but does not affect sex ratio IPs contain phytoestrogens like diadzein and genistein  In vitro rat whole embryo culture assay  WEC  studies of genistein in rats have indicated fetotoxic and teratogenic potential at concentration of ≥  μg mL  However  in vivo  an oral  gavage  embryonic and fetal development pilot study could not demonstrate any teratogenic effect in the same study 
These findings are different from our study probably because we used SSDs containing natural herbal and non herbal ingredients unlike those studies where synthetic genistein was used 
In both the studies  decreased body weight was observed indicating slight maternal toxicity 
Food consumption was unaffected in our study which is contrary to what was reported 
In another study  pregnant rats exposed to oral isoflavones  diadzein and genistein in varying combinations  showed alterations in the number of live foetuses  lysed foetuses  number of resorption sites  and implantation sites while no clinical signs suggestive of maternal toxicity  seizures  tremors and salivation  that was observed similar to our study 
Maternal mass gain was significantly reduced in rats treated with   mg kg of isoflavones  Ratio of females to males in the litter of different groups was similar akin to our finding  These observations clearly nullify the claim that consumption of SDDs could alter the sex of the growing foetus 
An analysis done by the same authors earlier revealed that SSDs contain testosterone and steroids 
 
  The prenatal testosterone in pregnancy is known to affect sexual development adversely      The principles of reproductive biology state that the genetic sex of an individual is determined at the time of conception and can never be altered under any circumstances 
However  phenotypic sex of the growing foetus is likely to be influenced by the hormonal milieu of in utero environment 
Our analysis was confined to phenotypic sex only and hence it is difficult to state if any differences existed with reference to genetic and phenotypic sex 
This requires further inquiry Evidence on the effects of SSDs on humans should best be obtained from human beings 
The findings of the current study corroborate well with the evidence generated from observational studies in human beings      Presence of skeletal and visceral malformations could explain why stillbirths are likely to be more in women who consume SSDs 
The dosing of the test drugs was intended not only to examine the period of organogenesis solely but to assess effects from preimplantation  through the entire period of gestation to the day before caesarean section 
The results were based on observations of more than   female animals with implantation sites at necropsy that added to its strength 
Unnecessary handling of pregnant animals as well as any stressors from outside was avoided 
At least three dose levels and a concurrent vehicle control were used with dams randomly allocated to different treatment groups that support the validity of the results 
However  absence of   rats per group does not support it to be a fully OECD compliant study 
We did follow the principles of Good Laboratory Practices  GLP  but due to constraints of resources the study could not be conducted as a GLP compliant study  though this is optimal for academic interests There is a lack of systematic approach to assess the safety and effectiveness of herbal preparations 
Ingredients for herbal medicines are often drawn from different sources and are used in combination  which may exhibit variability in terms of species  growing conditions  and biologically active constituents 
To isolate each active ingredient from each herb and then to establish its toxicity is time consuming  resource intensive and not practical 
Moreover  drug approval process does not accommodate undifferentiated mixtures  Though important  it surpasses the herb herb interaction and the potentiating effect of one compound over another 
Therefore  in our study  we administered the herbal mixture to assess the effects 
Real time evaluations have yielded important observations for several herbal drugs especially related to pregnancy 
For instance  Wang et al 
  used mice model to evaluate the adverse pregnancy outcomes after maternal exposure to the herbal medicines  particularly during early pregnancy  The major events included maternal and perinatal mortality 
Maternal weight gain  embryo growth and post natal weight gain were significantly decreased 
Moreover  foetal resorption and skeletal malformations were increased  signifying potential toxicity of Chinese herbal medicines 
This is comparable to our findings To conclude  the results of this developmental toxicity study suggest that administration of SSD  and SSD  to pregnant rats exerted significant impact on intrauterine foetal growth and development without any effect on sex ratio when administered during the period of organogenesis 
The prenatal exposure of SSD  and SSD  at dosage level of   mg kg day and   mg kg day during gestational days  –  to female rats had demonstrable effect on maternal or embryo foetal toxicity and teratogenicity SBN and AG conceptualized the study  AS and DD developed the study protocol and conducted the experiment  analysed the data and interpreted the findings

It is therefore natural to expect that the distribution of amino acids  across all protein sequences  would appear to be fixed  given no mutations over a specific period of time 
Of the   naturally occurring amino acids  each seems to appear randomly located at a particular position within the sequence of a protein 
However  when the sequences of a group of proteins are compared to one another  specific patterns begin to emerge 
These patterns are commonly referred to as motifs and frequently produce similar structural elements and in many cases  similar functions between the proteins that contain them 
In recent years  significant efforts have been made to reduce sequences into discrete motifs  so that each can be linked to some specific biological function based on particular rules      
Databases that consist of identifiable amino acid motifs  such as PROSITE  Pratt and EMOTIF  have been constructed to allow researchers an easy classification of unknown proteins into families based on their common motifs               
All of these methods share one property  they depend on specific alignment algorithms  such as the basic local alignment search tool  BLAST or PSI BLAST  to perform the sequence comparison between diverse families of proteins being analyzed      
These methods have already led to a number of key discoveries and offer the promise of determining biologically meaningful information about function from a protein s primary sequence It is generally accepted that a strong correlation exists between a protein s amino acid sequence and its resulting structure and function         
Techniques that can quickly determine significant similarities between protein sequences are valuable in predicting an unknown protein s function within the cell 
Here we describe a procedure that  by computing the frequency of key amino acid pairs  can quickly classify large groups of proteins into functional groups 
In order to uncover any relevant amino acid strings  we have utilized statistical methods applicable to datasets with large fluctuations in the search of human protein sequences within both the Swiss Prot and Complete Human Genebank databases The goal of this manuscript is to demonstrate how these two residue motifs can be used to develop rapid methods for searching protein or genomic databases in order to locate potentially interesting or aberrant protein sequences 
As an example  we describe the distribution of select amino acid pairs within the genome of the Coronavirus  Tor  which is responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome  SARS    
We have examined additional sets  but the limited format of this paper precludes a large presentation of potential applications The set of all   naturally occurring  amino acids are described by their standard single letter representations  and are taken as the complete set contained within all protein sequences as shown below Zq A R N D C Q E G H I L K M F P S T W Y V Residues that are arranged in a certain order can be referred to as vectors and are represented symbolically as b n b b bn bj Zq The coordinates of each vector represent the amino acid symbols contained within any given protein  where n is the total length of the vector 
The collection of all vectors b n  in the proteome can therefore be denoted simply by Zq n The underlying structure of a protein sequence  which is the order of the amino acids  has unique and identifiable characteristics 
As an analogy  in written English  the letter q is almost always followed by u 
Also  the frequency of the word  and  is much higher than that of the related three letter strings   nad   nda   dan  and  dna  which are simply permutations of the same set of individual letters to construct a word with a different meaning 
Utilizing similar characteristics  we can intuitively scan for unique sequence vectors contained within any given protein 
We expand on these characteristics  by utilizing the concepts of affinity and order stability in Section  Using the entire Swiss Prot database  release number   as the basis for our calculations  we have constructed a probability table for the occurrence of the   naturally occurring amino acids  see Table  
    
In addition to the Swiss Prot database  we have also included data from Complete Human Genebank  NCBI Build Number   March    as a source for all characterized and hypothetical human protein sequences We use the symbol Ω to denote the Swiss Prot database  and the letter M to denote the number of proteins in the database  
Hence we can state that Ω As s M  where As a a as Ns  is the sth protein  ai with i Zq is the ith amino acid in the sequence  and Ns is the length of the protein sequence As 
For any vector b n  if there is a sequence As in Ω such that b n  is a segment of As  then we can say b n  occurs in Ω 
We can then use NΩ b n  to denote the total number of outcomes that b n  has occurred in Ω  and let NΩ n  be the total number of all vectors occurring in Ω with length n  Therefore p b n NΩ b n NΩ n is the probability that the vector b n  occurs in Ω 
We then introduce k p q b n log p b n q b n where p b n  and q b n  are any two probability distributions on Zq n  and b n  belongs to Zq n 
The quantity k p q b n  in Eq 
  is defined for any two probability distributions p b n  and q b n  on Zq n  where the distribution q arises from independent letter  i e  amino acid  probabilities 
Then  k p q b n  can be viewed as a random variable about b n  and its probability distribution is defined as follows F p q x PI k p q b n ⩽x b n k p q b n ⩽xp b n The expectation value μ p q  and variance σ p q  of p b n  are expressed mathematically as μ p q b n Zq n p b n k p q b n 
 σ p q b n Zq n p b n k p q b n μ p q  Hence we see that μ p q  is simply the Kullback–Leibler entropy   
As a consequence  μ p q  is always non negative and μ p q  if and only if p b n q b n 
As a result  the amino acid sequence of b n  can be represented by k p q b n In Eq 
  the probability distributions p  q in the k p q b n  have several possible values 
For example  if we let p be the probability of b n  and only change the value of q in k p q b n  we obtain the following expression q b n j np bj p b p b p bn Based on Eqs 
  and   the value of k p q b n  gives us the affinity for all amino acids within vector b n 
Here two situations are identified as especially interesting i When k p q b n  implies that among the amino acids in vector b n  there is an increased affinity 
That is  the vector b n  occurs more frequently than expected 
 ii When k p q b n  implies that among the amino acids in vector b n  there is a decreased affinity 
That is  the vector b n  occurs less frequently than expected In a similar approach to the condition described above  we may choose q b n p πn b n  where πn b n  is a permutation of b n  and πn denotes a permutation transform 
In this case  the order sensitivity of b n  can also be reflected by the value of k p q b n  and produces the following outcomes i when k p q b n  implies that b n  occurs much more often than πn b n ii when k p q b n  implies that πn b n  occurs much more often than b n In addition to the concepts of affinity and order sensitivity  we can also design other analysis techniques by choosing alternate representations of q b n 
Quantifying the terms k p q b n  we can represent vector frequency numerically 
In cases where k p q b n μ p q ⩾ σ p q  the corresponding vector b n  is called  positive  while in those cases where the opposite takes place  k p q b n μ p q ⩽ σ p q  the vector b n  is called  negative 
By judiciously choosing a   equal to   we obtained   two residue  positive pairs  and   two residue negative pairs  see Table  
  out of a total of   possibilities of amino acid pairs Using any one of the positive motifs from Table   we can develop a test method to detect changes in their distribution through any protein database 
If b b b  is  positive  then p b b μ σp b p b  where p ⋅  is the probability of the amino acids or vectors ⋅ in the database 
Since NΩ μ M Nμ p bj NΩ bj μ MNμ we have NΩ b μ M Nμ μ MNμ μ σp b NΩ b or NΩ b μ M Nμ μ MNμ μ σp b NΩ b and since μ M Nμ is very close to μ MNμfor Swiss Prot database we have NΩ b μ σp b NΩ b and NΩ b μ σp b NΩ b As a consequence of Eq 
  the detection of a deleterious mutation based on the increased appearance of an arbitrary string of these residues becomes possible 
For example  according to Table   CC is an attractive motif with   then NΩ CC μ σp C μ M Nμ μ MNμNΩ C ≈ μ σp C NΩ C Let Ns CC  and Ns C  be the number of CC and the number of C in the sth protein 
Then we have NΩ CC NΩ C  because μ σ  and p C  since NΩ CC s MNs CC NΩ C s MNs C Based upon the result that the CC pair represents a rare event  proteins satisfying Ns CC Ns C  as defined in Eq 
  suddenly become interesting 
We can therefore consider the number Ns CC  as an index to develop detection methods to test for the presence of a CC containing protein within a database 
Using this same reasoning  one can also use any other one of the remaining motifs in Table   to develop detection methods for additional proteins In an identical fashion to the previous example using the positive two residue motifs in Table   we can also use any of the  negative  two residue motifs to develop search methods 
For example  the CM pair is a  negative  two residue  word  with  
That is  p CM μ σp C p M 
Using identical arguments to those described in Section   we obtain NΩ CM NΩ M  and NΩ CM NΩ C 
Since both Ns M  and Ns C  are small numbers for fixed proteins  the overall number of CM pairs in most proteins should be close to zero 
Therefore  we can also use any of the remaining seven  negative  motifs in Table   to develop additional detection methods In contrast to the CC motif  the total number of proteins in the Swiss Prot database having more than one CM pair is quite small 
For example  among the   proteins contained within this database  the number of proteins such that Ns CM ⩾  is   and the number of proteins satisfying the condition Ns CM ⩾  is only  
For human proteins in Swiss Prot  the total number of proteins containing CM pairs is   and there are only   proteins that satisfy Ns CM ⩾   Table  
However  we would expect to find about   proteins having CM pairs in the Swiss Prot database  based upon the amino acid frequencies given in Table   which is greater than the number observed Cysteine rich proteins and the presence of CC pairs in proteins are both concepts that have been studied previously      
If we combine these two concepts and describe them in mathematical terms  we observe that the rates q Ns C Ns and q Ns CC Ns C  describe these two conditions  where Ns  Ns C  and Ns CC  are the numbers of all amino acids  cysteine  and CC  respectively 
We can then derive proteinsNs C Ns p C σ Ns CC Ns C p ξτ C ξτ C σ where σ  and σ  are the standard deviations about Ns C Nss Mand Ns CC Ns C s M respectively We have found the following computational results based on Swiss Prot database σ ≈ σ ≈ andp ξτ C ξτ C ⩾ p C For   we have a much simpler method to determine that a protein sequence is both C  and CC rich if proteinsNs C Ns ∩proteinsNs CC Ns C So  a much simpler method to test whether a protein is a both C  and CC rich for   isNumber of CC  Number of C Number of C  Length of protein Using this principle  we found a total of eight proteins that are both C  and CC rich within the Swiss Prot database For   there is an easier method to determine whether a protein sequence is both C  and CC rich if proteinsNs C Ns ∩proteinsNs CC Ns C So  a much simpler method to test whether a protein is both C  and CC rich for   is based on the inequalitiesNumber of CC  Number of C Number of C  Length of protein Using this principle  we can get a total of   proteins that are both C  and CC rich within the entire Swiss Prot database For   there is also an easier method to determine if a protein sequence is both C  and CC rich sequence when proteinsNs C Ns ∩proteinsNs CC Ns C So  a much simpler method to test whether a protein is both C  and CC rich for   is based on the inequalitiesNumber of CC  Number of C Number of C Length of protein Using this principle  we have identified a total of   proteins that are both C  and CC rich within the Swiss Prot database 
From these results  it becomes clear that there are many C rich proteins and many CC rich proteins that are not mutually inclusive 
The sets of both C  and CC rich proteins are only subsets of the set containing all C rich proteins or that containing all CC rich proteins Because the Swiss Prot database is somewhat biased to those proteins that are of interest to researchers  we have decided to examine a database that was  in essence  complete 
For this  we chose the human subset sequences contained within the Complete Human Genebank database 
This was the most complete and readily available source of human genetic sequences and should therefore provide us with an accurate representation of both CC and CM pair distributions 
We observed that the total number of CC pairs within the human subset of sequences contained in Genebank  a total of   proteins  was  
These pairs were contained within a total of   proteins  Table   a number that is substantially larger than the   we obtained from Swiss Prot data  Table  
Since the total number of amino acids in The Complete Human Genebank is   we can easily get the expected number of CC in Complete Human Genebank is   which is much less than this actual value  
The same also holds true for the CM pair  where we would expect to see   CM pairs  but actually observe    Table  
 
This result is surprising but true and shows that there are fundamental difference between the Human and other species in terms of the frequency of CC and CM pairs To create a single CM pair  it is obvious that one needs only a single C  If a protein sequence also contains a CC pair  the total number of cysteines available to create a CM pair has been reduced by a factor of  
Using the cutoff value of four CC pairs as statistically significant  we determined the probability of finding a CM pair within proteins that already contained a CC pair  Table  
Even though both CC and CM can occur in the same protein  the total number of proteins in Genebank that contain both CC and CM pairs is   and these pairs almost always occur at different locations in the sequence 
However  in some rare cases the second C within the CC pair is shared with the first C within the CM pair  giving us a new triplet CCM If we filter the set of proteins described above for redundant entries  we obtain a set of   unique proteins that contain the CCM triplet in the human proteome 
Using the probability distributions obtained from Swiss Prot  we obtained the probability of CCM as  
Since the total of all protein lengths in the Swiss Prot database is   there should be a total of   CCM triplets 
This value is almost identical to the predicted number of CCM of  
This result suggests that the CCM triplet at least in Swiss Prot occurs randomly 
However  we can also analyze the CCM probability using a different approach  putting q CCM p CC p M  into Eq 
 
If CCM occurs randomly  then we have p CCM p C p C p M  and since p CC μ σp C p C  we will get k p q CCM log p CCM q CCM log p C p CC ⩽ μ σ Based on Eq 
  it is clear that the presence of a CC pair strongly excludes M  Therefore  the probability of the CCM triplet should occur less frequently than that of CC or M individually We have obtained the following statistical results with regard to the total number of CC and CM pairs contained in the Swiss Prot database i The total number of these proteins satisfying Ns CC ⩾  is   and   of these are found in humans 
 ii The total number of human proteins in Ω that satisfy Ns CC ⩾  is  
 iii The total number of the proteins in Ω that satisfy Ns CM ⩾  is     of these are found in humans 
 iv The total number of human proteins in Ω that satisfy Ns CM ⩾  is only  
The genome of the SARS associated Coronavirus contains a total of   open reading frames  which code for six characterized and five uncharacterized proteins   
After examining the complete proteome the SARS associated Coronavirus we observed a statistically significant increase in the occurrence of the CC and CM pairs in the SARS associated Coronavirus  genome Of the   putative proteins  four contain either CC or CM pairs 
Two large poly proteins  GI  and GI  contain   CC and   CM pairs  as well as   CC and   CM pairs  respectively 
The putative spike glycoprotein  GI    contains   CC and   CM  while the small envelope protein  GI    contains only   CC pair 
The remaining   proteins  of which two have been identified as a nucleocapsid and matrix protein  contain no CC or CM pairs 
When compared to the occurrence of CC and CM pairs within all human proteins found in the Swiss Prot database  it becomes clear that there is an increased occurrence of these pairs within the SARS associated Coronavirus proteome It is clear that the frequency of CC and CM pairs is significantly higher in the SARS genome than it is in the human genome 
It is our hope that these unique two residue motifs could be used as a means of identifying a virus such as SARS 
While currently impossible to determine  one can see a possible clinical use for determining the frequency of CC or CM pairs in an individual 
If a person has been infected by SARS  we would expect the numbers of CC and CM pairs to be much higher than in a healthy individual 
If we were then able to develop a clinically feasible technique that could identify the CC or CM pair content in total cellular protein  without damaging the cell  it could be possible to implement a detection method simply by counting the numbers of CC or CM pairs in all proteins examined 
If the presence of increased CC or CM pairs was indicative of infection by SARS we could develop new drugs to inhibit the translation of proteins that contain these pairs within infected cells 
As a very specific example  this could be accomplished through the use of specific tRNA mimics that could block translating ribosome when these pairs appear at the P and A site simultaneously      
While tRNA mimics could normally be seen as non specific protein synthesis inhibitors  the lower frequency of the CC or CM motifs in host proteins as compared to the relatively high occurrence in viral protein provide a starting point for the analysis of treatments using methods such as these In this paper we have performed a detailed search of the Swiss Prot and Complete Human Genebank database in relation to the frequencies of each of the   natural amino acids and motifs made up of two residues 
This has provided us with a new insight into the distribution of proteins within these databases and the information that may be contained within a protein s primary amino acid sequence 
Our focus in this quest has been to examine specific pairs or triplets of residues and use probability theory to assess whether or not particular strings of residues occur more frequently than their probability would indicate 
By analyzing affinity and anti affinity  we developed a procedure to search out all two  and three residue clusters within these databases 
Through this technique  we can rapidly classify large groups of proteins into families based on the occurrence of these motifs 
Combining this concept with a specific knowledge of protein function  we propose novel ideas aimed at developing fast detection methods for specific diseases based on the unusually high occurrence of some of these motifs when compared with the expected probabilities 
A timely example of the application of this method is given  namely the analysis of the SARS virus 
This method will hopefully lead to the discovery of new diagnostic techniques and possible treatment of diseases  by recognizing the location of target domains in the expressed sequence Cell type specific expression of the putative SARS CoV  receptor ACE  in human heartsThe coronavirus disease    COVID  caused by SARS CoV  infections imposes a major threat for the world s healthcare systems and is leading to thousands of deaths 
Angiotensin converting enzyme    ACE  has been identified as a potential receptor for SARS coronavirus  and is also considered the main receptor for SARS CoV  SARS CoV  binds to ACE  via its glycosylated outer membrane spike proteins 
ACE  is highly expressed in the lung and heart  and is known for its vital role in the cardiovascular system –  Although SARS CoV  mainly invades alveolar epithelial cells  it can also cause myocardial injury  as assessed by increased troponin T and NT proBNP levels accompanying increased cardiovascular symptoms in COVID infected patients  It is unclear whether elevated biomarkers of cardiac injury  or long term effects on the cardiovascular system  are directly caused by viral infection of cardiac tissue or are secondary to hypoxia and systemic inflammation 
However  patients with underlying cardiovascular disease represent a significant proportion of the patients who may suffer from a severe course after COVID  infection  This situation may be aggravated by findings showing that ACE inhibitors  which are often used to treat cardiovascular diseases  augment the expression of the SARS CoV  receptor ACE  in lung cells  This is probably mediated by an effect on angiotensin II  which is known to reduce ACE  expression  Thus  ACE inhibition decreases angiotensin II  leading to an indirect up regulation of ACE  The effect of angiotensin II receptor blockers  ARBs  which primarily target the angiotensin receptor   is unclear 
One may speculate that ARBs indirectly reduce ACE  levels by augmenting free angiotensin II levels  which in turn is expected to down regulate ACE  via activating the angiotensin receptor  
However  the effect of the two different treatments on the expression of ACE  in the heart requires further investigation Therefore  we used single nuclei RNA sequencing to determine the expression of ACE and ACE  in the different cell types of the human heart 
Gene expression signatures were detected in cardiac tissues of five patients with aortic stenosis  AS  and two patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction  HFrEF   Figure  A  and compared with with samples of one healthy donor heart  age    years  male  that was not used for transplantation 
After single nuclei RNA sequencing  data were pooled  and unsupervised clustering was performed with a total of     nuclei 
We found   distinct clusters 
Using cell type specific gene markers  major cell types were annotated  including cardiomyocytes  six clusters  fibroblasts  one cluster  endothelial cells  three clusters  leucocytes  two clusters  pericytes  one cluster  and smooth muscle cells  one cluster   Figure  B–D 
ACE  was expressed in cardiomyocytes  Cluster   and   and mural cells  particularly pericytes  Cluster   and was detected at a lower expression level in fibroblasts  endothelial cell  and leucocytes  Figure  D 
Comparison of ACE  in a pooled analysis of nuclei of the different groups showed that ACE  was significantly elevated in cardiomyocytes of patients with heart disease compared with healthy controls  Figure  E 
ACE  was also slightly  but not significantly  increased in endothelial cells  and the expression was lower in fibroblasts of patients with heart disease compared with healthy controls  Figure  E 
Immunostaining confirmed an increased expression of ACE  in cardiomyocytes of patients with aortic stenosis  Figure  F 
In addition  ACE was augmented in cardiomyocytes of patients with AS and HFrEF  Figure  G 
Interestingly  cardiomyocytes of patients who were treated with ACE inhibitors showed a significantly higher ACE  expression compared with ARB treated patients  Figure  H 
Moreover  patients treated with ACE inhibitors had an imbalance of ACE to ACE  expression  with a more than four fold higher ACE ACE  ratio compared with healthy control cells  Figure  I In conclusion  these data provide novel insights into the cell type specific expression and regulation of ACE  in the heart 
Patients with varying heart disease aetiology show augmented expression of ACE  levels particularly in cardiomyocytes 
Treatment with ACE inhibitors tends to be associated with increased ACE  mRNA and unfavourable ACE ACE  ratios  which are believed to be a driver of cardiovascular pathologies  This study is limited by its small sample size and therefore is only hypothesis generating 
However  these novel data suggest that it will be important to monitor SARS CoV infected patients for cardiovascular complications and assess the impact of ARB ACE inhibitor therapy 
Conflict of interest  none declared New onset acute symptomatic seizure and risk factors in coronavirus disease   A retrospective multicenter studyIn December   pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus  later called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus    SARS‐CoV‐  was first reported in Wuhan  China 
On March     the World Health Organization  WHO  declared the syndrome caused by SARS‐CoV‐  infection  coronavirus disease    COVID‐  a pandemic 
According to a WHO Situation Report of April    
 
 there are   confirmed COVID‐  cases and   deaths globally 
COVID‐  affects people of all ages 
 
  
 
 and in severe cases  it may cause dyspnea  hypoxia  acute respiratory distress syndrome  and septic shock 
 
  
 

The current situation has raised concerns regarding whether people with epilepsy have a higher risk to be infected with COVID‐  and whether people would develop acute seizures during the course of COVID‐ 
The objective of this study is to clarify the incidence and the risk of acute symptomatic seizures during acute COVID‐  infections This retrospective multicenter study was approved by the ethics committee of West China Hospital  Sichuan University  approval   
The study was conducted in   officially designed hospitals in Hubei province  the epicenter of the COVID‐  epidemic in China  Sichuan province  and Chongqing municipality 
These hospitals included the East Branch of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University  West China Ward  Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital  and hospitals in Sichuan province designated by the government to treat COVID‐   see the list of hospitals in Appendix S People with COVID‐  who were discharged from or died in the participating hospitals between January   and February     were consecutively enrolled 
All cases were diagnosed according to the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for COVID‐   trial version  
 
 All those enrolled tested positive through nucleic acid detection 
Disease severity was classified as mild  moderate  severe  or critical according to the national guidelines  see Box   for classification criteria 
 
 For our study  we aggregated severe and critical cases into a single severe group  whereas mild and moderate cases were aggregated into a single milder group 
The clinical outcome at discharge was either cured or death Electronic medical records of all enrolled cases were reviewed by   neurologists using a standard case report form  Appendix S 
Data were extracted on demographic characteristics  medical history  complications  treatments  and presence of risk factors for seizures 
These risk factors were considered to be the following  acute cerebrovascular disease  traumatic brain injury  TBI  central nervous system  CNS  infection  shock  hypoxia  severe metabolic disturbance  based on criteria from the International League Against Epilepsy
 
  multiple‐organ dysfunction syndrome  sepsis  and exposure to drugs or toxic substances Continuous variables were presented as median  interquartile range  and categorical variables as n  All of   people discharged from or who died at participating hospitals were consecutively identified and enrolled 
Most were from Sichuan province  n     followed by Chongqing  n     and Hubei  n    Ten individuals died  giving case fatality rates of    n     in Hubei     n     in Chongqing  and    n     in Sichuan 
Of the   severe cases      received mechanical ventilation  and     were given sedatives 
Apart from the effect of sedatives  mental state was relatively normal in   people 
Eight were encephalopathic  one was obtunded  one was delirious  and six were comatose 
The diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus was not made in any of these cases based on clinical presentation  results of investigations  or response to therapy 
No routine or long‐term electroencephalogram  EEG  was recorded due to exposure concerns None in this cohort had a past history of epilepsy 
None had any seizures  including febrile seizures  or status epilepticus during hospitalization 
Seizurelike events were seen in two people  it was believed that this was the result of an acute stress reaction in one and hypocalcemia in the other The first was a  ‐year‐old woman who reported bilateral bodily spasms lasting for about   minute  with mouth deviation but no impairment of awareness 
She was evaluated neurologically and psychiatrically and was diagnosed with an acute anxiety disorder  which was treated with olanzapine  paroxetine  and diazepam The second case was a  ‐year‐old woman who displayed bilateral myoclonus in the limbs with no impairment in consciousness   hours after admission 
Although this was initially suspected to represent seizures  she was found to have an electrolyte disturbance including hyponatremia  hypokalemia  and hypocalcemia  and the myoclonus resolved with correction of the metabolic disturbances Eighty‐four   cases reported systemic or direct brain insults that increased their risk for acute symptomatic seizures  Table  
The most common risk factor was hypoxia 
No severe electrolyte disturbance was seen  but hypokalemia  n       hyponatremia  n       and hypocalcemia  n       were frequently seen in the cohort 
Urea  creatinine  and serum glucose levels were moderately altered in most of cases 
In two cases who had chronic kidney dysfunction  substantial increases in creatinine levels were noted 
Results of investigations are shown in Table  
One case with TBI had an epidural hematoma  cerebral contusion  and skull base fracture 
Five people with severe COVID‐  experienced septic shock 
Three other cases of shock had hypovolemia or cardiac problems 
Ninety‐four   were given antibiotics  moxifloxacin  n       piperacillin sulbactam sodium  n       and third‐generation cephalosporins  n       were most commonly used We found no new onset seizures or status epilepticus in a large cohort of people hospitalized during the acute phase of COVID   infection despite a substantial proportion having risk factors for acute symptomatic seizures 
This is useful information  given the prior lack of knowledge about seizure risk during the acute phase of infection No individual in this cohort had a history of epilepsy prior to hospital admission 
To date  there is not much information available on people with epilepsy during the COVID‐  crisis 
There is one report of epilepsy in a case COVID‐  from Wuhan 
 
 As information is limited  it is not possible to establish whether this was a patient who had a history of epilepsy or whether the patient presented acute seizures 
There is at this time little if any evidence indicating that people with epilepsy are at an increased risk of COVID‐  infection 
A major challenge for people with epilepsy in this outbreak is nonadherence with the prescribed antiseizure medication  which was seen during the in SARS endemic in  
 
 This indicates the need to ensure the availability of supplies of medications and to advocate patients  self‐management 
Possible strategies for coping could also include online consultations and telemedicine networks Although many neurological and systemic disorders regarded as potential triggers
 
 of acute symptomatic seizures were identified in this cohort  seizures and status were not seen 
Stroke is one such risk factor 
The risk of developing acute symptomatic seizures after stroke ranges from   to  
 
 Acute cerebrovascular disease is considered a major cause of seizure and status epilepticus 
An earlier study from Hubei
 
  
 
 also reported six people with COVID‐  who had acute cerebrovascular disease without seizure 
Infection of the CNS can also give rise to seizures 
Although there is limited evidence of the presence of the SARS‐CoV‐  in the cerebrospinal fluid  CSF  the co‐occurrence of tubercular meningitis
 
 had been reported  with no seizure or status observed 
To determine whether COVID‐  can cause direct CNS insults requires further follow‐up 
In the earlier outbreaks of another coronavirus  a generalized convulsion with a positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for SARS‐CoV in CSF was reported  which could have been a coincidence 
 

Disturbances of homeostasis may lead to acute symptomatic seizures 
Hypoxia  the most common complication in our cohort  may trigger anoxic encephalopathy  particularly in refractory hypoxia 
Electrolyte disturbances as seen in COVID‐  are considered to be potential causes of acute symptomatic seizure 
 
 The severity and speed of such disturbances may affect onset of seizures  so these parameters should be carefully monitored The cytokine storm syndromes
 
 behind severe infection may cause the production of inflammatory cytokines systemically  with the consequence of acute toxic encephalopathies 
Although sepsis is a common cause of encephalopathy in intensive care medicine 
 
 hypoxia appears far more often than sepsis in COVID‐ 
There was also a high rate of septic shock in the COVID‐  population  varying from  
 
 to   in earlier studies in Hubei 
 
  
 

Certain antibiotics have been associated with symptomatic seizure 
 
 Antibiotics were used in a large number of people in our cohort without problems  but the most used antibiotics in the cohort were of low or moderate risk 
Clinicians should keep this seizure risk in mind when prescribing antibiotics  especially for people with renal dysfunction 
 

Our study has several limitations 
First  as a cross‐sectional study  we only have data from the acute phase of the disease 
A follow‐up study is underway to evaluate longitudinal seizure outcomes 
Second  the retrospective study design meant that we could not collect data on all relevant variables  for example  EEG was not recorded  so subclinical seizures could have been missed 
As all health care costs of COVID‐  treatment are covered by the government  all those suspected of infection are screened 
This may assure the objectivity and reliability of study materials  and it will allow for a future follow‐up study Our analysis suggests that COVID‐  poses minimal risk for seizures during the acute illness  although a significant proportion of severely ill individuals have risk factors that may increase the propensity to experience seizures 
These risk factors should be promptly addressed to minimize the risk of developing seizures 
Prospective long‐term studies must be done to determine whether people who have suffered from COVID‐  have an increased risk for developing seizures or epilepsy in subsequent months or years as a consequence of their illness None of the authors has any conflict of interest to disclose 
We confirm that we have read the Journal s position on issues involved in ethical publication and affirm that this report is consistent with those guidelines Decreased prealbumin level is associated with increased risk of mortality in hospitalized elderly patients with COVID The coronavirus disease    COVID  epidemic is caused by an infection with a novel coronavirus  officially named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus    SARS COV 
The infection spread rapidly on all continents and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization 
As of April       documented cases were reported worldwide  and   patients had died 
As there are currently no specific treatments and medications against the new virus  it is crucial to identify risk factors of severe prognosis Older patients have poorer prognostic factors and are more likely to experience critical disease 
 
 
Based on recent statistical data of China  among patients who were   years and older  the mortality rate was   which was significantly higher than that of younger patients at  
The proportion of deaths over   years old accounts for   of the total deaths in the national wide  which implicates aged people are more vulnerable to the SARS CoV 
Till present there are rare reports in literature focusing on the risk factors for poor outcomes of the elderly patients with COVID Serum prealbumin  known as transthyretin  its levels may be lowered not only by malnutrition  but also by inflammation and aging 
 
 
Compared to albumin  prealbumin has a shorter half life  a more rapid rate of hepatic synthesis  and predictable catabolic rate  hence  it may be a more sensitive indicator 
However  whether prealbumin could be an independent predictor of mortality in hospitalized COVID  elderly patients needs to be further elucidated The present study aims to describe the clinical characteristics and to investigate whether the prealbumin can serve as a valuable predictor of in hospital mortality  which might provide evidence for the risk stratification in elderly and help to improve the clinical practice and reduce fatality We designed this study as a retrospective cohort study design 
The elderly patients with COVID  who were admitted to Tongji Hospital in Wuhan from January   to February     were consecutively included 
This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Tongji Hospital  Approval Number  TJ IRB  and was complied with the Declaration of Helsinki 
The data were anonymous and the study was observational  so the informed consent was not gathered 
A flow diagram illustrating patient selection was described in Figure  
 
Inclusion criteria included elderly patients  ≥   years old  diagnosed with COVID  infection 
A total of   participants have been obtained 
Patients having missing baseline or outcome data  died on admission or being transferred to other designated hospitals during hospitalization were excluded 
There were   patients were included in the final analyses Data collection of participants was performed using hospital electronic medical record system 
Information included medical history  demographic data  physical examination  and hematological  biochemical  radiological and microbiological evaluation results were reviewed 
The data collection forms were reviewed independently by   researchers  CL and LYY 
Blood examinations were assessed at the central laboratory of Tongji Hospital following standard operative procedures 
The routine blood test was analyzed using Sysmex XE  hematology analyzer  Sysmex  Kobe  Japan 
The Cobas C   Roche  Mannheim  Germany  was used to measure the biochemical parameters 
Coagulation tests were detected by STA R MAX coagulation analyzer  Diagnostica Stago  Saint Denis  France 
Throat swab samples were collected and were tested for SARS CoV  with commercial real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  RT PCR  kit from DAAN GENE  Guangzhou  China 
The diagnostic criteria and all clinical procedures in this study followed  Diagnosis and Treatment of Pneumonia Caused by New Coronavirus  Trial version   to   promulgated by the National Health and Health Commission of China Summary statistics of baseline characteristics of all patients and stratification by prealbumin tertiles were expressed as frequency and proportion for categorical variables  mean   standard deviation  SD   Gaussian distribution  or median  range   Skewed distribution  for continuous variables  and as percentages for categorical variables 
The differences between groups were analyzed using the χ   categorical variables  One Way ANOVA test  normal distribution  or Kruskal Whallis H test  skewed distribution We examined the relationship of the prealbumin as categorized into tertiles with the outcomes of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation 
Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to evaluate these relationships  then unadjusted and adjusted odds ratio  ORs  and   confidence intervals  CIs  were calculated 
Model   is the minimally adjusted model with only sociodemographic variables adjusted 
Model   is the fully adjusted model with covariates including age  sex  smoking status  history of hypertension  history of coronary heart disease  history of diabetes  history of chronic kidney disease  history of carcinoma  history of chronic liver disease  neutrophil  lymphocyte  prothrombin time  activated partial thromboplastin time  d dimer  alanine transaminase  aspartate aminotransferase  total bilirubin  blood urea nitrogen  creatinine  C reactive protein and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio 
We calculated odds ratio  ORs  and   confidence intervals  CIs 
The highest tertile was the reference for prealbumin 
We performed test for linear trend by entering the median value of each category of prealbumin tertile as continuous variable to examine the possibility of nonlinearity To ensure the robustness of our results  we also performed stratified analyses with the prealbumin as a continuous variable for the overall population and stratified by gender  age  hypertension status and coronary heart disease status at baseline 
Generalized additive models were used to visually confirm the relationship between prealbumin as continuous variable and the risk of outcomes  all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation Modeling was performed with the statistical software packages R  http www R project org  The R Foundation  and EmpowerStats  http www empowerstats com  X Y Solutions  Inc  Boston  MA 
P values less than    two sided  were considered statistically significant In our study    cases were excluded 
To avoid selection bias due to missing data  we performed a sensitivity analysis 
The results showed that there was no statistical difference between missing group and non missing group  supplemental table  Of   elderly inpatients included in the final analysis  the mean age was     years  ranging from   years to   years  and most patients were male  table  
 
The baseline characteristics of these included participants were listed in table

No significant statistical difference in sex  smoking status  body weight  BMI  comorbidity  hypertension  coronary heart disease  chronic kidney disease  cerebral vascular disease  carcinoma  chronic liver disease  symptoms  fever  cough  headache  diarrhea and myalgia fatigue at admission  were detected across different groups of prealbumin  tertile 
When compared with subjects in the highest tertile  those in the lowest tertile were older  more likely to have diabetes medical history  with higher Neutrophil count  lower lymphocyte count  worse coagulation function and liver function 
A total of     patients required mechanical ventilation      patients admitted to intensive care unit and     patients died during hospitalization 
The incidence of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation were significantly decreased across prealbumin tertiles  all cause death    vs    vs    for tertile   vs  tertile   vs  tertile   ICU admission    vs    vs    for tertile   vs  tertile   vs  tertile   mechanical ventilation    vs    vs    for tertile   vs  tertile   vs  tertile   respectively To investigate the correlation between prealbumin and in hospital outcomes  we constructed three models using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models  table  
 
In the unadjusted model  the ORs of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation was significantly increased as the prealbumin tertiles downgraded 
The OR for tertile   was significantly higher than the OR for tertile    OR       CI    to   P   for all cause death  OR       CI    to   P   for ICU admission  OR       CI    to   P   for mechanical ventilation 
Additional adjustment for the demographic variables and comorbidities did not reduce the ORs for the association between prealbumin tertiles and in hospital outcomes 
Further adjusting for the baseline levels of blood examinations  including blood routine  neutrophil  lymphocyte  neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio  coagulation function  prothrombin time  activated partial thromboplastin time  d dimer  liver fuction  alanine transaminase  aspartate aminotransferase  total bilirubin  renal function  blood urea nitrogen  creatinine  and infection indicators  C reactive protein  did not affect the relationships in the fully adjusted models  OR       CI    to   P   for all cause death  OR       CI    to   P   for ICU admission  OR       CI    to   P     for mechanical ventilation 
Therefore  lower tertile of prealbumin exhibited an increased risk of worse in hospital outcomes  full adjusted P for trend for all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation  P     P   and P     respectively Generalized additive models  Fig  
A through  C  were used to visually assess functional relationships between the prealbumin as continuous variate and the risk of in hospital outcomes 
Serum prealbumin was found to have negative linear relationship with the risk of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation To determine the consistency of the relationship between baseline prealbumin as a continuous variable and in hospital outcomes  we conducted stratified analyses  Table  
 
For each unit increase of prealbumin  the adjusted OR for all cause death was   in males  P     and   in females  P    
The adjusted OR for all cause death for persons less than   years of age was    P     compared with    p     for persons   years and older  P interaction    
For each unit increase of the prealbumin  the OR for all cause death was    P     and    P     for normotensives and hypertensives     P     and    P     for non diabetic and diabetes respectively 
The difference of interaction was not significant between two groups  P interaction         and   stratified for gender  age  hypertention and diabetes respectively 
Moreover  the relationship between baseline prealbumin with ICU admission and mechanical ventilation stratified by gender  age  hypertention and diabetes are consistent In this study  we found that lower serum prealbumin significantly associated with an increased risk of worse outcomes and all cause death during hospitalization 
Patients in the lowest tertile of prealbumin were older  and with higher Neutrophil count  lower lymphocyte count  worse coagulation function and liver function compared with subjects in the highest tertile 
Then we adjusted relevant covariates including age  sex  smoking status  comorbidities  neutrophil  lymphocyte  coagulation function  liver function  renal function and C reactive protein to minimize the potential impact of confounding 
Compared with crude regression analyses  this association still persisted when adjusting for demographic and clinical variables in the multivariable regression analyses 
Moreover  stratified by gender  age  hypertension and diabetes  increased level of serum prealbumin was associated with the decreased risk of all cause death  ICU admission and mechanical ventilation  which determine the consistency of the relationship between lowest serum prealbumin tertile and the increased risk of worse outcomes in elderly COVID  patients Several previous studies have demonstrated baseline prealbumin change in COVID  patients 
Decreased level of prealbumin was observed among COVID  patients 
Wu C et al investigated   patients with COVID  and observed that prealbumin was associated with the development of ARDS  indicating the potential value of prealbumin level on COVID  clinical ending 
Till date  no report exists on the effect of prealbumin in COVID  elderly patients High proportion of severe to critical cases and high fatality rate were observed in the elderlyCOVID  patients  and rapid disease progress was noted in the dead 
One possible explanation involves the greater potential of seniors to be in a state of inflammation  nutritional deficiency and other complications 
Prealbumin is a globular  non glycosilated protein  synthesized by the liver  and complexed with a retinol binding protein  which acts as a transporter of retinol vitamin A and thyroid hormones 
Low plasma prealbumin level has far back emerged as an earliest laboratory indicator of poor nutritional status 
 
 
In addition  prealbumin are also associated with inflammation 
Previous studies showed that in response to the inflammation  the body responds by synthesizing a large number of cytokines 
These include interleukins and tumor necrosis factors that down regulate  decrease  plasma concentrations of albumin and prealbumin 
 
 
Therefore  assay of serum prealbumin concentration is recommended by some investigators as a screening marker for both malnutrition and inflammation Elderly with low plasma prealbumin levels mean that those people are at greater risk of malnutrition and inflammatory conditions  which may lead to poor prognosis 
Malnutrition is commonly seen in hospitalized patients in both the developed and developing world  especially among elderly patients 
A review of   published studies of acute care patients reported that malnutrition incidence ranged from  –  of hospitalized elderly 
It was found that compared to non famine regions of India  experiencing famine had significantly higher influenza mortality rates during the   Influenza pandemic 
Aging  frailty  and chronic diseases are associated with impaired immune function and are compounded by immune dysregulation from malnutrition 
When immune response is dysregulated  it would result in an excessive inflammation  even death 
In the current COVID  study  it was found that elderly patients have higher levels of white blood cells counts  CRP  inflammatory cytokines and are more likely to experience critical disease than did those younger patients 
 
 This retrospective cohort study included   elderly COVID  patients  until the date of February       of patients required mechanical ventilation    of patients admitted to intensive care unit  and the total in hospital mortality was  
The mortality rate was lower than that reported by wang L et al  among elderly COVID  patients 
This may have been the reason for some patients at the date of February     are still in hospital 
Nevertheless  this would not bias the relationship between prealbumin and in hospital outcomes because of the definite observation time we set previously 
Moreover  Wuhan tongji Hospital as one of the largest third grade Class A hospitals equipped with advanced life support training and equipment may partly account for the moderate mortality The results of this study have several clinical implications and strengths 
A low prealbumin concentration can therefore be regarded primarily as a signal identifying the at risk elderly patient who would suffer worse outcomes and requires careful assessment and monitoring for whom nutritional support and Inflammation detection may be needed as part of the treatment plan 
As observational study was susceptible to various confounders  we adjusted many variables that may affect the relationship between prealbumin and in hospital outcomes to minimize potential confounding 
In addition  we tested the robustness of the results by repeating the analyses in different subgroups of gender  age  history of hypertension and history of diabetes Our study has some limitations 
First  by including patients still in hospital as of J February     the case fatality ratio in our study cannot reflect the true mortality of elderly COVID 
Second  the record of data may be affected by prehospital medication and the time interval between admission and onset 
Third  since all subjects in our study were hospitalized Chinese elderly patients diagnosed with COVID  results of this study might not directly be applied to other ethnicities and age groups In conclusion  this retrospective cohort study revealed that the prealbumin is an independent risk factor for the in hospital mortality in the Chinese COVID  elderly patients 
Nutritional support and Inflammation detection should be careful assessment and monitoring for the elderly patients with low prealbumin concentration

Coping With COVID  Emergency Stress  Secondary Trauma and Self Efficacy in Healthcare and Emergency Workers in ItalyThe coronavirus disease  COVID  or the acute respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus    SARS CoV  began spreading in China at the end of   and  to date  represents an international health emergency without precedents in terms of its health  economic  and organizational effects on people s lives  World Health Organization   
After China  Italy was the first country to be affected by this epidemic  with the first deaths on February     and a rapid increase in the spread of infection and mortality 
COVID  was first detected in Northern Italy  and it then spread  although at different rates of incidence  to the other regions 
It was immediately evident that healthcare and emergency workers were at great risk of contagion and that protection and intervention protocols needed to be introduced in the absence of adequate points of reference because of the exceptional nature of the epidemic  the rate of spread of the infection  the seriousness of patients  health condition  and the mortality index 
The extreme conditions in which health workers have had to work  especially in the most affected regions in Northern Italy  are indicated by the following data from the Italian National Institute of Health   over   doctors died and   other health workers were infected within the general context of the population of   deaths and   infections in a span of   weeks 
It was also clear that the medical staff would experience serious psychological repercussions because of the working conditions as well as the difficulty of having scientific points of reference on care and intervention procedures 
To this must be added the increase in workload  the extension of working hours and  for health workers  the frequent exposure to the suffering and death of their patients 
Therefore  healthcare and emergency workers were subjected to serious psychological as well as physical stress 
Hence  the aim of this study  which was also the aim of a previous study  Vagni et al    is to focus on the similarities and the differences in the stress management of two professional groups healthcare and emergency workers during the acute phase of the pandemic 
Both groups have had to deal with COVID patients as frontline responders and have been exposed to the related risks of infection and psychological consequences  which  to date  have not been examined in detail through a comparative analysis As regards the stress that they experience  the literature clearly explains that healthcare and emergency workers who intervene in emergency situations are exposed to the risk of developing dysfunctional reactions that can be identified at different levels physical and or physiological  e g  psychosomatic disorders  sleep wake cycle alterations  and sense of tiredness  emotional  e g  irritability  nervousness  agitation  anger  low self esteem  and guilt  cognitive  e g  distractibility  sense of ineffectiveness  and negative anticipation of events  and relational  e g  increase in conflicts within emergency teams and or with their organization institution  and social withdrawal and may also develop reactions from secondary trauma  Del Missier et al    Sbattella    Argentero and Setti    Fraccaroli and Balducci    Bellelli and Di Schiena    Walton et al   
Faced with stressful events regarding which they lack previous experience and specific  necessary knowledge  and which cause tension owing to the need for rapid decision timings and a sense of responsibility  emergency workers may experience a sense of decision ineffectiveness 
In fact  emergency situations are characterized by high levels of decisional and operational uncertainty with associated regret and guilt  Del Missier et al   Several studies have highlighted that insufficient instructions and a lack of personal protective equipment  PPE  are important predictors of stress for healthcare and emergency workers in large scale emergencies  Oh et al    Du et al    El Hage et al    Walton et al   
Oh et al 
  highlighted that nurses involved in managing the Middle East respiratory syndrome  MERS  experienced lower levels of stress when the levels of goods supply and hospital training were higher 
Some studies have highlighted that frontline healthcare workers had lower secondary traumatization scores than non frontline health workers and the general public in contrast to the findings of previous research on the SARS outbreak in the same area in Singapore  Chan and Huak   
According to Barleycorn   and Tan et al 
  these results may be due to the dedicated training and psychological support given to healthcare workers after the SARS outbreak and demonstrate the validity of policy strategies for prevention of stress in the psychological health field An analysis of   studies published from January to March   aimed at investigating the stress experience of healthcare workers in facing COVID  shows that health workers experienced symptoms of depression and anxiety related to this stressful experience 
Moreover  the severity of their symptoms was influenced by their age  gender  role  specialization  type of activity performed  and exposure to patients with COVID  however  prevention  resilience  and social support interventions mediated their response to stress  Bohlken et al   
In a review of the literature  Spoorthy   underlined that sociodemographic variables  such as age  gender  profession  and workplace  and psychological variables  such as poor social support and self efficacy  affect the stress level experienced by health workers 
In addition  COVID  emerged as an independent stress risk factor 
Xiao et al 
  found that social support plays a role in reducing the anxiety levels in medical staff and increases their sense of self efficacy According to Walton et al 
  the specific stressors that health workers face in the COVID  emergency are related to the organizational context 
The challenges for medical staff include not only an increased workload but also a fear of infection  the need to work with new protocols that change frequently  and the use of PPE 
In uncontrollable situations such as a pandemic  when specific action protocols are absent and limited resources are available  health workers must make individual decisions with a heavy burden of responsibility that may be contrary to their moral principles 
For example  in the case of COVID  they may have to choose which patients to save because only a few places are available in intensive care 
In this regard  Cai et al 
  showed that for a sample of   healthcare professionals who worked closely with COVID  patients in Hubei  the most stressful factors were the lack of protocols for the treatment of COVID  the scarcity of PPE  the exhausting work shifts  their concern about the risk of infection  and their exposure to the death and suffering of their patients 
They also found that the support of superiors proved to be one of the most important motivational factors for medical staff  and the presence of clear guidelines and effective safety protocols were protective factors against the development of stress  in particular  for females 
Further  Walton et al 
  identified the organizational stressors as the changes in work shifts  the prevalence of night shifts  an excessive workload  staff roles  autonomy  the lack of support from superiors  and the absence of adequate information and clear instructions 
On the basis of these stressors  they estimated that   of the medical staff working on the front line of this pandemic are at risk of developing post traumatic stress disorder  PTSD 
In addition  limited resources  longer shifts  decreased hours of rest  and the occupational risks associated with COVID  exposure have increased the physical and mental fatigue  stress  anxiety  and burnout of these staff members  Sasangohar et al   The loss of a social support network  which can be an important resilience factor  is another risk factor  Ozbay et al   
In the COVID  emergency  healthcare and emergency workers have often experienced a separation from their affective links  either because of the restrictions on social contacts imposed by the lockdown or the fear of spreading the infection to their family members 
To this must be added that although  at first  health workers received unanimous encouragement from the population  later  they also experienced demonstrations of stigma and isolation 
Some studies have shown that being able to resort to their own social support network is a significant protective factor for health workers dealing with this emergency  Cai et al   As Favretto   stated  when individuals experience situations that go beyond their coping strategies  their vulnerability to  and risk of developing  psychopathological reactions increases 
Studies conducted during previous epidemics  such as the SARS  MERS  and Ebola epidemics  converge in detecting how healthcare and emergency workers may experience extremely high levels of stress and even develop secondary traumatic stress or vicarious trauma 
This trauma is defined as an experience of symptoms similar to those found in people with PTSD  such as in emergency nurses working with traumatized patients  Beck   
Figley   defined it as a form of stress that derives from the feelings of empathy experienced when helping traumatized people 
The symptoms may include intrusive recurring thoughts  disturbed sleep  fatigue  physical symptoms  hyperarousal  increased stress response  anxiety  depression  and feeling emotional  Adriaenssens et al   
Wolf et al 
  described how nurses may feel  overwhelmed  and this condition becomes a source of moral distress that triggers feelings of powerlessness  guilt  fear  anger  and frustration The sense of frustration and impotence felt by nurses when they are unable to treat and save a patient has been highlighted as a risk factor for secondary traumatic stress in several studies  Missouridou   
Avoidance and emotional numbing can become tools for self protection from intrusive symptoms that exceed the personal tolerance level  Coetzee and Klopper    Mealer and Jones   
Their frustration obviously intensifies on a patient s death 
The onset of PTSD in the health workers involved in treating MERS was also detected after the acute phase of the emergency was over  highlighting a risk not only in the immediate period but also in the medium term period  Lee et al   In reference to COVID  updated studies conducted on Chinese health workers have already highlighted the strong impact of the epidemic on the psychological health of doctors and nurses 
Some studies have found that healthcare workers have high levels of anxiety  depression  insomnia  and distress  Lai et al    Li et al    Zhu et al   
In particular  female professionals with more than   years of experience and previous psychiatric pathology present more risk factors of developing the symptoms of stress  anxiety  and depression  Lai et al    Zhu et al   
Huang J 
Z  et al 
  studied stress levels during the COVID  emergency in a sample of medical staff 
They found that females showed higher levels of anxiety and PTSD than males did and that the levels were higher for nurses than for doctors 
Moreover  Li et al 
  found that nurses had developed higher levels of vicarious trauma than those of the general population and that nurses who did not work closely with COVID  patients showed a more severe symptomatology  both physical and psychological  compared with their colleagues working on the frontline emergency services 
In Italy  a study conducted on healthcare workers found that doctors and nurses developed high levels of stress and anxiety  greater than those developed by the general population  and that healthcare workers operating in the North  the area of Italy most affected by the virus  showed a more severe symptomatology  Simione and Gnagnarella   
This study also confirmed that females tend to have a greater perception of the risk of infection  which increases their risk of developing the symptoms of anxiety and distress Because of their long  intense exposure to various stressors  it is important to note the nature of the coping strategies used by these healthcare and emergency workers in these situations and their effectiveness in terms of reducing and effectively coping with stress 
Indeed  the effective management of stress levels in the acute emergency phase could reduce the risk of developing long term PTSD or other pathologies  such as anxiety and depression  Fullerton et al    Slottje et al    Argentero and Setti    Sakuma et al    Birinci and Erden    Li et al   
Coping may be defined as a series of cognitive and behavioral efforts to manage specific internal or external issues that test or exceed individual resources  Lazarus and Folkman   
A distinction can be made between problem focused and emotion focused coping strategies 
The former is aimed at modifying and solving the stressful situation through active interventions 
By contrast  emotion focused coping is aimed at managing the emotions connected to the stressful event and regulating affective reactions  such as anxiety and the tension of response to stress  for example  by trying to avoid the threat  denial  or re evaluating it  reappraisal The choice of coping strategies is influenced by the individual s cognitive evaluation of the event  termed secondary evaluation  which involves estimating the resources available and the most effective strategies to deal with the situation  Lazarus and Folkman   
A key element of this assessment is the extent to which the individual can maintain control over the outcome of the situation 
The literature indicates that individuals apply dysfunctional coping when they face an uncontrollable event by responding primarily with a coping strategy focused on the problem  and conversely  when they face a controllable situation  they respond with coping strategies focused on emotions  Strentz and Auerbach    Vitaliano et al   
A coping strategy may be defined as adaptive when the controllability of the stressful event corresponds with the choice of coping strategy  in this case  the subject will experience fewer symptoms related to stress  Park et al   The strategies used to cope with trauma may differ among individuals  but they can also vary according to the profession and the features of the traumatic event  Nydegger et al   
Individuals differ in their choice of coping strategies  Connor Smith and Flachsbart    and factors related to the situation can also have a decisive influence on such choice  Brown et al   
A few studies have considered the ways in which gender influences the perception of stress in emergency situations and the choice of coping strategy 
These studies highlight that females tend to perceive events as more negative and uncontrollable and to resort more to coping strategies focused on emotions and avoidance  whereas males tend to resort more to applying problem focused coping and to inhibiting emotions  Matud    Matud et al    Matud and Garcia   The literature on the relationship between coping strategies and the stress levels of emergency workers has shown that the use of coping strategies focused on the problem usually tends to correlate with lower stress levels  both in healthcare workers  Watson et al    Howlett et al    and in other emergency workers  such as firefighters  Brown et al   
However  a coping strategy frequently used by emergency workers is that of avoidance and minimization  and this strategy is associated with higher levels of stress  Brown et al    Chang et al    Kerai et al    Witt et al    Theleritis et al   
Loo et al 
  found that in a group of emergency workers  avoidance as well as coping strategies focused on emotions were associated with the development of post traumatic symptomatology 
Rodríguez Rey et al 
  revealed that among health workers working in a pediatric emergency department  approximately   of the variance in PTSD was explained by the frequent use of coping strategies focused on emotions and the infrequent use of those focused on the problem 
In addition  Kucmin et al 
  who considered a sample of   paramedics  highlighted that the risk of developing PTSD symptoms was predicted by the use of coping strategies focused on emotions However  the literature does not offer unanimous results 
Chamberlin and Green   found that in a group of firefighters  all coping strategies actually correlated with high levels of stress  the authors explained this finding by suggesting that it is not the individual coping strategies that are maladaptive in themselves  but that greater effort is needed to adjust in stressful situations 
By contrast  Young et al 
  indicated that firefighters use problem focused coping strategies more often at the beginning of the operation and emotion focused coping strategies more commonly in the phase of breakdown and fatigue 
However  after the incident  they use both strategies  Young et al   
A meta analysis by Shin et al 
  highlighted that different coping strategies have different effects on work burnout  in particular  emotional stress and depersonalization are associated with the use of emotion focused coping strategies  whereas professional ineffectiveness is associated with the use of problem focused strategies Further  a few studies have investigated the coping strategies that emergency workers can use during health emergencies similar to COVID 
Maunder et al 
  revealed that healthcare professionals who tended to apply dysfunctional coping strategies  based on avoidance  hostile comparison  or self blame  tended to develop higher stress levels 
Wong et al 
  highlighted that during the SARS epidemic  doctors and nurses tended to use different coping strategies 
The doctors tended to turn more to action planning  but this strategy did not affect their stress level 
Instead  their stress level was positively correlated with their use of coping strategies based on emotional outlets 
By contrast  the nursing staff tended to resort more to behavioral disengagement and distraction strategies  which  however  correlated with higher levels of stress among them In this regard  during the MERS epidemic  hospital staff tended to adopt coping strategies related to the use of PPE and the adoption of all prevention measures  as well as social support  whereas the coping strategy that they adopted the least was that based on an emotional outlet  Khalid et al   
A recent study on healthcare workers in Hubei  China  during the COVID  epidemic  Cai et al    yielded similar results  to reduce stress  the medical staff tended to rely on active coping strategies  such as using security protocols  practicing social isolation measures  and seeking support from family and friends  but they did not find it necessary to discuss their emotions with a professional 
Huang L  et al 
  found that a sample of nurses working during the COVID  emergency presented greater emotional reactions and turned more to problem focused coping compared with university nursing students 
Emergency workers must have sufficient self efficacy in terms of their coping skills to be able to manage and cope with stress levels 
Self efficacy in coping appears to be an effective protective factor in relation to stress levels and maladaptive responses  Chesney et al   
Self efficacy to cope with traumatic events has been effective in reducing the risk of developing PTSD  Bosmans et al   The main objective of this study is to identify the coping strategies activated by healthcare and emergency workers to deal with stress factors related to the COVID  emergency that may be associated with the risk of developing vicarious or secondary trauma 
Few studies have considered both groups simultaneously when analyzing the strategies they have adopted to manage stress during the COVID  emergency 
Hence  in this study  we are interested in detecting the similarities and differences in the approaches they adopted to manage their stress during the acute phase of the current pandemic According to Walton et al 
  the main acute stress reactions of emergency workers to emergency medical situations are emotional  cognitive  physical  and social reactions 
Therefore  these factors were included in the questionnaire used in the present study 
Moreover  reactions linked to stress factors for difficulties due to ineffective decision making and dealing with stress were also considered  Chesney et al   
In addition  fears regarding contracting the virus and infecting their own families because of COVID  were specifically considered  Du et al    Huang J 
Z  et al    Ornell et al    Walton et al   Based on results found in the literature  the specific objectives of this study are as follows Participants were selected on a voluntary basis through a trasversal sampling in order to take a picture of the situation caused by the pandemic emergency 
We used an internet platform to conduct the study and approached the participants using social media  dedicated mailing lists  and forums 
Participants from all Italian regions completed the questionnaire online 
The sample consists of   participants  males   and   females  whose average age was   years  SD     min   – max  
Further    of the sample were married    were separated  and the remaining   were single 
We selected various professional figures who had directly worked in various sectors during the COVID  emergency and who could be divided into two main groups 
The first  the  Health Group  consists of   participants   who were healthcare workers    doctors     nurses     psychologists   and seven healthcare assistants  
Their average age was   years  SD     and their average years of active professional service was    SD    
The second  the  Emergency Group  consists of   participants     emergency workers     firefighters   and   Civil Protection staff   whose average age was   years  SD     and average years of service was    SD    
There was an age difference between the two groups  t     p   and the distribution of the gender variable differed between the two groups  with   males and   females in the Health Group and   males and   females in the Emergency Group  χ    p    
The study involved participants from the entire national territory  and their workplace could be divided as follows      and   were from North  Central  and South Italy  respectively 
Further    of the sample worked directly with COVID  patients and   worked in specific COVID  departments 
Among the healthcare workers    had worked in direct contact with COVID  patients  whereas among the emergency workers  only   had assisted these patients  χ    p    
In the present study  we included two variables  lack of necessary instructions and lack of PPE  in accordance with the findings in the literature on their impact on the stress reactions of healthcare and emergency workers during the COVID  pandemic 
Among the participants    and   of healthcare and emergency workers  respectively  did not have sufficient instructions to intervene  χ    p n s 
  and   and   of healthcare and emergency workers  respectively  lacked adequate PPE when working  χ    p n s 
 This study used an online questionnaire and was conducted during the lockdown period owing to the COVID  pandemic 
The questionnaire had three parts  one each to collect online informed consent and baseline sociodemographic information  and one with an online series of questionnaires  as described in the next section 
Participants  anonymity was maintained in collecting the data 
The institutional Ethics Committee approved all the procedures This instrument s   items enable verification of the presence of two symptoms of vicarious trauma  Intrusion and Arousal  and their relative frequency 
The STSS was built on the basis of the conceptualization expressed in the DSM   American Psychiatric Association    regarding the characteristic PTSD symptoms 
In detail  the Arousal items describe situations characterized by anxiety  confusion  physical and psychological complaints  and agitation 
Intrusion refers to the re experiencing of the traumatic event even if not directly suffered through internal images and memories 
Instructions for the STSS I indicated that respondents should specify how frequently an item was true for them in the previous   weeks 
The statements are evaluated on a  point scale     never      very often  that provides scores for Intrusion  example items   I thought about my work with victims when I didn t intend to   Reminders of my work with clients upset me  and Arousal  example items   I had trouble concentrating   I was easily annoyed   I expected something bad to happen   I felt jumpy 
The reliability coefficients of the instrument are   and   for Arousal and Intrusion  respectively This is a  item measure of perceived self efficacy for coping with challenges and threats 
This measure focuses on the changes in individuals  confidence in their ability to cope effectively  based on the self efficacy theory  Bandura    Chesney et al   
Participants were asked   When things aren t going well for you  or when you re having problems  how confident or certain are you that you can do the following  Then  they were asked to rate on an  point scale the extent to which they believed they could perform important behaviors for adaptive coping 
The instrument yields three subscale scores   problem focused coping   α      stop unpleasant emotions and thoughts   α     and  support   α    
Anchor points on the scale are    cannot do at all     moderately certain can do  and    certain can do We constructed an ad hoc  item questionnaire that included Yes No questions to detect stress factors identified by the literature  such as the availability of suitable equipment and the receipt of clear instructions during the COVID  coping experience 
In this study  we present the results related to two of these items   Instructions  which refers to having received the necessary instructions to intervene  and  Equipment  which refers to having PPE 
Predictions of these factors have also been made in other studies  Du et al    Walton et al   
In light of the relevance and specificity of the lack of clear information or instructions and adequate PPE in the management of COVID  in the Italian context  as well as the findings in other studies  we decided to focus attention on these two risk factors Our analysis of the literature revealed that in situations in which they have to cope with a pandemic  several factors may affect the stress of medical staff and emergency healthcare workers and that COVID  represents an independent specific stressor  Spoorthy   
These stress factors have been identified as frequently affecting healthcare and emergency workers in emergency situations and leading to physical  emotional  cognitive  decision making  relational  and organizational stress  Del Missier et al    Sbattella    Argentero and Setti    Fraccaroli and Balducci    Bellelli and Di Schiena    Du et al    Walton et al   
Focusing on the specificity of the COVID  epidemic  items have been constructed regarding the fears of contracting the infection and of infecting colleagues or family members  Walton et al    since COVID  represents a factor of independent stress  Spoorthy    that has great impact  Huang J 
Z  et al   
Consequently  we constructed the ESQ consisting of   items assessed on a  point Likert scale  with scores ranging from    not at all  to    very much  grouped into six scales 
The participants were asked to indicate how often they experienced certain emotions and thoughts while performing intervention and emergency activities during the COVID  pandemic The scales correspond to the factors identified and confirmed by factorial analysis through an analysis of the main components with orthogonal rotation of factors  varimax 
The number of factors to be extracted was initially verified through the unit s largest eigenvalue criterion and  subsequently  by the scree test 
The ESQ is based on six scales The ESQ demonstrated good internal consistency  α     overall and for each individual scale  Organizational–Relational Stress  α     Physical Stress  α     Inefficacy Decisional Stress  α     Emotional Stress  α     Cognitive stress  α     and COVID  Stress  α    First  we performed Pearson s correlation analyses to identify the associations between the variables for the two groups that we considered in this study 
Subsequently  we checked for significant differences between the two groups as their stress levels  coping strategies  and secondary trauma 
We used hierarchical linear regression models to verify the predictive effect of the risk factors  lack of adequate information and PPE  on the different stress levels  in step  
Then  we verified the protective effect of the coping strategies  in step  
The models were controlled for age  gender  and group 
Lastly  we used hierarchical regression models to verify the predictive effect of stress factors on the components of secondary trauma 
The models were controlled for age  gender  and group First  we conducted correlational analyses and comparisons of averages on the reference sample 
Table   shows the correlations between the scales of the ESQ and the other instruments Preliminary comparisons were made through the Student s t test between the Health Group and the Emergency Group in relation to the ESQ  CSES SF  and STSS I scores 
Table   shows the comparison between the two groups As shown in Table   significant differences emerged between the two groups in relation to their Stress and Arousal levels 
The results indicate higher levels of both for the Health Group  and that emergency workers turn more to the Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts strategy 
Further  we performed comparisons with reference to the gender variable to detect differences in the levels of stress factors  coping strategies  and secondary trauma 
Females reported significantly higher Physical Stress than males did  Females  M     SD     Males  M     SD     t     p     as well as Emotional Stress  Females  M     SD     Males  M     SD     t     p     and COVID  Stress  Females  M     SD     Males  M     SD     t     p    
No gender difference emerged in coping strategies and secondary trauma 
Within the Health Group  there were significant differences regarding Inefficacy Decisional Stress  F     p     Doctor M     SD     Psychologist M     SD     average difference     p     and COVID  Stress  F     p     Nurse M     SD     Doctor M     SD     difference     p    
Within the Emergency Group  there were no differences in levels of stress and secondary trauma or coping strategies 
Moreover  we found similar correlations between the two groups for the Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts strategy and the stress factors  whereas for the other two coping strategies  we found a different association  particularly for the Emergency Group 
However  the t test comparisons highlight differences only at the level of the Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts strategy 
Given the findings of the preliminary analyses  we considered it necessary to include the age  gender  and group variables to test the predictiveness of the coping strategies on the participants  stress levels To test the predictive effect of the coping strategies on various levels of stress  hierarchical regression was conducted 
Considering the Age and Gender differences within the groups  we included these variables in all models together with the Group variable  Health vs 
Emergency  and the  Instructions  and  Equipment  variables 
The models generated by assuming the ESQ scales as dependent variables are shown in Table  
Regarding the coping strategies  we observed an important effect of the Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts Coping strategy on all the stress scales  except for Physical Stress where the effect of the Focused Problem Coping strategy is recorded As shown in Table   significant negative associations between stressors and secondary trauma were found for both groups 
The hierarchical regression models of stress scales were analyzed for the Arousal and Intrusion levels of secondary trauma 
The models included the Age  Gender  Health Emergency Group variables  and the ESQ scales 
The results are shown in Table  The same regression models were generated by including coping strategies as predictors and were analyzed by Age  Gender  and Health Emergency Group 
Compared with Arousal  the Health Emergency Group and Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts are predictive  R    F     p     Beta  ∗∗∗  Beta  ∗  respectively 
Compared with Intrusion  only the Stop Unpleasant Emotions and Thoughts variable  R    F     p     Beta  ∗  assumes significance This study has several limitations 
The first is the limited sample size 
The second is that our study involved participants in the very midst of the COVID  emergency  which means that the level of stress in healthcare workers may have been more severe and acute 
Moreover  the long term psychological implications for the healthcare and emergency population should be investigated for the presence of a full secondary trauma 
Therefore  a large sized longitudinal study is called for to further explore the pathogenesis of vicarious traumatization 
The third is that participants were not selected based on whether they had existing psychological problems 
In proposing the hypothesis of this study  we anticipated that we would be able to discover the relationships between coping strategies  emergency related stress  and secondary trauma in healthcare and emergency workers and commenced our investigation by assuming that the impact of stress can provoke psychological consequences in emergency situations 
In future work  this assumption could be tested to verify whether an emergency situation has a different impact on workers who have already experienced psychological problems The raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors  without undue reservation  to any qualified researcher The studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by Comitato Etico per la Sperimentazione Umana – CESU of the University of Urbino

As reported by some  the association of acute kidney injury  AKI  and COVID  has a high mortality   
However  the incidence of reported AKI associated with COVID  varies widely             
It would be expected that kidney involvement is frequent since the virus enters the cell through the angiotensin converting enzyme    ACE  which is expressed  in addition to pulmonary type   alveolar cells  on renal proximal tubular cells  glomerular visceral and parietal epithelium  and the cytoplasm of the distal tubules and collecting ducts         
In addition  COVID  induces hemodynamic instability and severe inflammation  which  in addition to direct renal infection  can induce acute tubular necrosis  ATN 
We report our experience with AKI in COVID  patients in an inner city  predominantly minority  and a low socioeconomic group and compare our experience with other studies in significantly different cohorts of patients 
We identify the incidence  risk factors  and prognosis of AKI and thus provide a broader understanding of this complication in a group of patients not specifically reported upon to date All adult patients   years of age admitted to the Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center with COVID  infection from March   through April     were studied in this retrospective analysis done in a single medical center serving a low income minority population in Brooklyn  NY 
It was one of the single centers with the most admissions of COVID  patients 
COVID  infection was diagnosed based on clinical presentation  radiographic lung abnormalities  and a positive result of real time PCR 
We excluded COVID  patients from our study if they were on maintenance hemodialysis or were renal transplant recipients 
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Brookdale Hospital and did not require patient consent because of its retrospective design We collected the demographics  the presenting clinical symptoms when available  prior medical history including outpatient medications and prior level of renal function  comorbidities  and in hospital laboratory data from the electronic medical record  Epic Hyperspace   
Laboratory data consisted of complete blood count  hemostasis parameters  renal and liver function  PF ratio  arterial oxygen partial pressure  PaO  fractional inspired oxygen  FiO   creatinine kinase  lactate dehydrogenase  and inflammatory markers including high sensitivity C reactive protein  hs CRP  ferritin  and D dimer 
Normal range of these measures was provided by our laboratory The Kidney Disease  Improving Global Outcome  KDIGO    definition was used to identify AKI 
Estimated glomerular filtration rate  eGFR  on admission was taken as baseline eGFR and was divided into   and ≥  mL min  m 
eGFR was estimated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study  MDRD  equation 
The earliest day of the serum creatinine change that met the KDIGO criteria for AKI was selected as day   of AKI 
The peak serum creatinine value was used to determine the stage of AKI  with an increase in the serum creatinine of  –   –  and   times the baseline serum creatinine defined as AKI stages     and   respectively Continuous variables were described as mean   standard deviation for normally distributed data  or median and interquartile range  IQR  values for non normal distribution 
Categorical variables were presented as frequency and percentage 
The mean of continuous variables was compared by using independent t tests  the Wilcoxon rank sum test  and the Kruskal Wallis test  across the stages of AKI 
The proportion of categorical variables was compared by using χ  test 
Fischer s exact test was used when there were only limited data available 
The Kaplan Meier method  log rank test  was used to determine the cumulative incidence of in hospital mortality 
We used the Cox proportional hazard  PH  regression to determine the association of kidney disease indicators and in hospital mortality 
The assumptions of the Cox PH model were checked using the Schoenfeld residuals  and no violations of the assumptions were present 
In the multivariable analysis  separate Cox PH models were used to determine the association of baseline eGFR and blood urea nitrogen  BUN  on admission  proteinuria  hematuria  and stages of AKI with in hospital mortality since these variables showed a highly significant correlation 
Variables for Cox PH regression were selected using stepwise regression 
Variables with α level of risk factor   were entered into the model 
While evaluating the association of hematuria and proteinuria with in hospital mortality by the Cox PH model  patients with missing values  n     were excluded from the analysis 
All statistical analyses were performed using the STATA version   software and a p value of   was used to determine statistical significance In this study    adult confirmed cases of COVID  were initially reviewed 
Patients on maintenance hemodialysis  n     were excluded from the study and   patients were used for the analysis 
Baseline characteristics of these patients are shown in Table  
  of our cohort were African Americans and   were Hispanics 
The median age of the patients was   years  IQR  –  and   of them were male 
Most of these patients presented with dyspnea   cough   and fever  
  of the patients had a systolic blood pressure below   mm Hg at presentation 
   n     of all patients were mechanically ventilated during the hospitalization 
The median values of ferritin  D dimer  hs CRP  creatinine kinase and lactose dehydrogenase were elevated above their reference ranges  see online suppl

The development of AKI was seen earlier in the course in patients with an eGFR   mL min  m  at presentation   vs    and occurred within   h of admission 
Patients who developed AKI during the hospitalization were more likely to have a systolic blood pressure of   mm Hg at presentation and a lesser PF ratio and were more likely to be intubated during the course of hospitalization  Table  
Eighteen out of   patients with documented chronic kidney disease  CKD  prior to admission developed AKI during the hospitalization

This represented   of all patients and   of those with AKI 
All the patients who required RRT by definition had stage   AKI 
The modalities of RRT were continuous RRT in   patients   of all those who required RRT  and intermittent hemodialysis in   patients  
Two patients   required both modalities of RRT 
    out of   of those patients who required mechanical ventilation developed AKI compared with     out of   of nonventilated patients 
Of these   patients      required RRT 
The majority of AKI stage   patients requiring RRT were on mechanical ventilation   out of   requiring RRT 
  of the patients who were treated with RRT   out of   patients  died during the hospitalization 
Of those with stage   AKI who were not dialyzed    died

The in hospital mortality of AKI patients was     out of   who developed AKI died   Table  A significantly higher in hospital mortality was observed in patients with an eGFR   mL min  m  at presentation  elevated BUN at presentation  and in hospital AKI using the Kaplan Meier analysis  Fig

In a multivariable Cox PH model  adjusted for age  gender  PF ratio  hemodynamic status  and comorbidities  diabetes  HTN  hyperlipidemia  cancer  and stroke  eGFR   mL min  m  at presentation  BUN on admission  and AKI greater than or equal to stage   was associated with a higher risk of in hospital mortality 
There was no significant association between in hospital mortality and proteinuria and or hematuria  Table  AKI is common among hospitalized patients  incidence  –  and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality       
In our cohort of   COVID  patients  a relatively higher percentage of patients     of   developed in hospital AKI 
Current evidence suggests that AKI in COVID  patients is a result of an interplay of virus mediated injury  a dysregulated inflammatory response  angiotensin II pathway activation  hypercoagulation  and microangiopathy   
These COVID specific factors likely interact with the other known risk factors for AKI  such as hemodynamic instability  hypoxia  and sepsis  which increased over time 
The increase in the cumulative incidence of AKI over time in our cohort is likely associated with concomitant clinical deterioration and less likely represent a unique renal effect of COVID 
Compared to studies of AKI in COVID  patients from other countries  we found our incidence to be higher than that reported from   Asian countries  –  and is similar to that in an Italian study             
However  it is lower than that in the more recent report by Hirsch et al 
  who detailed their experience in   academic and community hospitals in metropolitan New York   none of which are located in the inner city  lower socioeconomic neighborhoods with a predominant minority population 
As compared with the above cited studies  the incidence of stage   AKI   was highest in our cohort 
It is not possible to determine with certainty the cause s  of this wide variation 
However  we did note a higher prevalence of comorbid conditions in our group 
For example  Cheng et al 
  reported a   incidence of AKI  with a   prevalence of HTN and a   prevalence of DM in their study population 
In our cohort  roughly twice as many   had HTN  and more than   times as many   were diabetic  Table  
Also  the incidence of severe lung involvement that required mechanical ventilation was lower   than ours    Table  
Mechanical ventilation per se has been reported to be strongly associated with AKI   
In our cohort  the incidence of AKI was also higher among those requiring mechanical ventilation  We identified various risk factors for AKI in our study  Tables    
Similar to previous reports  our patients with AKI were more likely to be male  have a history of HTN  and have severe respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation     
In our study  higher BMI increased the likelihood of developing severe AKI 
A low eGFR at presentation more than doubled the risk of developing AKI  p      Table  
Patients with lower eGFR had a significantly higher cumulative incidence of AKI than those with eGFR   mL min  m   p     Fig 
 
Thus  there was a synergistic effect of reduced baseline kidney function and subsequent AKI 
We did not find an association between diabetes and in hospital AKI The role of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors  ACEi  in COVID  is a subject of ongoing debate 
ACEi can increase the expression of ACE  the receptor used by SARS CoV  to enter target cells     
However  ACE  has been shown to be beneficial in acute respiratory distress syndrome when replaced     
This possible protective effect is attributed to the degradation of proinflammatory angiotensin II to angiotensin by ACE 
At present  it remains unclear if ACEi facilitate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus    SARS CoV  cellular entry and intracellular virus replication and whether ACEi improve acute respiratory distress syndrome outcomes 
In our cohort  the use of ACEi was significantly higher in patients with a lower admitting eGFR  Table   and in those who experienced AKI  Table  
We found a similar association between AKI and non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs  but not with angiotensin II receptor blockers  ARBs  in our cohort  Table  
Further studies are necessary to delineate the relationship between ACEi  angiotensin II receptor blockers  and COVID  outcomes Markers of acute inflammation  ferritin and CRP  muscle injury  creatinine kinase  myocardial injury  and D dimer levels were significantly higher in patients with a low eGFR at presentation  online suppl 
Table   and in those with AKI  online suppl 
Table   suggesting causality by a dysregulated immune inflammatory response  the so called  cytokine storm We found an extremely high incidence of mortality in our study cohort 
High presenting BUN and low eGFR   mL min  m  were significantly associated with increased mortality  Table  
AKI was significantly associated with increased mortality 
The mortality risk was highest in stage   AKI  HR   CI  –   Table  
Mortality was   in the AKI group and   in the non AKI group  p    
Mortality rose concurrently with the AKI stages      and   for stages     and   respectively  Table  
These rates were over   and  fold higher than those reported by Hirsch et al 
    AKI    in non AKI 
However  our cohort s high mortality is similar to the findings of John Hopkins University and the American Community Survey 
They reported a   and  fold higher COVID  infection and mortality rate in predominantly African American counties than in predominantly white counties   
Wadhera et al 
  also reported a death rate of   per   in Brooklyn  about   higher than that of Manhattan 
Moreover  in New York City  current age adjusted mortality is highest among African Americans and about   times that of whites   Our hospital provides medical services for an ethnic minority and a low income population in the most impoverished neighborhood in Brooklyn  where   of the residents live below the Federal Poverty Level as per a   report   
  of our patients identified themselves as African Americans 
In comparison  in the study by Hirsch et al 
     identified themselves as whites  and only   identified themselves as African Americans 
The high representation of ethnic minorities in our study population may have contributed to the increased mortality 
This association has been widely publicized and is likely the result of a complex interplay of multiple factors 
These include  but are not limited to  a high burden of comorbidities  genetics  the pernicious influence of adverse socioeconomic determinants of health  the absence of the privilege to work from home  and the ability to follow the recommended social distancing   In our cohort      of the   patients with AKI required RRT 
Nineteen out of these   patients   were mechanically ventilated 
Thus  almost all of the additional requirements for acute dialysis during the COVID  pandemic at our institution were in intensive care units 
Overall      out of   of mechanically ventilated patients required RRT 
Elevated ferritin was associated with an increased risk of all stages of AKI and the need for RRT  online suppl 
Table  
Among those who received RRT      died versus     in the stage   AKI group who did not undergo RRT  p      Table  
Thus  there was no statistically significant improvement in survival  and the mortality remained extremely high in both the RRT and non RRT groups 
These findings should prompt the early involvement of a palliative care team to define goals of care in patients with COVID  disease and stage   AKI In our experience  ultrafiltration was not well tolerated 
It often increased pressor requirements and did little to improve the ventilatory status 
We observed a high incidence of hypercoagulability and frequent clotting of the dialysis filters  lines  and catheters 
Thus  the patients required higher than the usual doses of heparin Our study has limitations 
Although     of the study population had a low eGFR on admission  only     had a documented history of CKD 
Data were collected retrospectively from medical records and often did not have information regarding prior renal function 
Patients also may have had an elevated creatinine on admission secondary to AKI suffered prior to hospitalization 
If so  we may have underestimated the true overall incidence of COVID associated AKI 
It is not possible to rectify this problem  given the data at our disposal Our study is a single center study  with the majority of the study population identifying themselves as African Americans or Hispanics 
This limits our study s general applicability but provides a unique insight into this population and broadens our understanding of COVID  disease 
Data were missing on many patients at different stages of the hospitalization since they were collected retrospectively 
Importantly  little data were available regarding urine output  a defining characteristic of AKI 
With this lack of information  we may have again underestimated the true incidence of AKI Nevertheless  even with the above limitations of our study  the high incidence of AKI and its negative impact upon survival is abundantly clear 
In response to the high incidence of AKI in our patients with COVID  we increased our capacity to deliver RRT 
These efforts included the purchase of additional machines and dialysis solutions  additional staff training  and engineering alterations to allow dialysis on the general medical floors 
Also  we increased our stockpiles of catheters  filters  and dialysis solutions for intermittent and continuous RRT 
We also plan to establish a peritoneal dialysis program to further strengthen our acute dialysis capacity In conclusion  our data report explicitly upon a high proportion of ethnic minority patients in an inner city  severely economically deprived neighborhood  previously not studied 
Our patients experienced a high incidence of AKI and an extremely high mortality  especially in AKI stage  
Unfortunately  RRT provided little survival benefit 
Policy changes and planning in preparation for this high incidence of AKI in COVID  patients are necessary at the local and national levels Study was approved by Institutional Review Board  IRB  Brookdale Hospital The authors have no conflicts of interests to declare The authors did not receive any funding U Z

  supervisor Dynamic changes in computed tomography manifestations of   patients
with novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan  ChinaDuring the first week of December   a few cases of pneumonia caused by a novel
coronavirus appeared in Wuhan  Hubei Province  China 
The patients had a history of
visiting the nearby Huanan seafood market  where wild animals were sold  With the spread of the disease  such cases have also been found in other
parts of China and abroad 
As of   July     cases have been confirmed
worldwide  including   deaths and   recoveries The novel coronavirus was originally named   novel coronavirus  nCoV  it was
recently officially renamed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus  
 SARS CoV  by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses 
The disease
caused by SARS CoV  has been named coronavirus disease    COVID  by the World
Health Organization 
Like SARS CoV  SARS CoV  likely originated in bats  however 
the intermediary animal host remains unclear 
The nearest neighbor of the  nCoV
isolates from China is a bat SARS like coronavirus  Bat SL CoVZC SARS CoV  carries a high risk of human to human transmission  and such transmission
has been reported in family clusters and among medical workers  The main route of transmission
is respiratory droplets and contact transmission  the virus may also be transmitted
through the conjunctiva and via aerosols  Current epidemiological surveys indicate that the latency period generally
ranges from   to   days  with a maximum of   days 
Affected patients present with
pneumonia like symptoms  including fever  fatigue  cough  expectoration 
pharyngalgia  anorexia  and myalgia 
Some patients also have gastrointestinal
symptoms  including diarrhea  nausea  vomiting  and abdominal pain 
In severe cases 
patients may rapidly develop acute respiratory distress syndrome  septic shock 
difficult to correct metabolic acidosis  and coagulation dysfunction Increasing numbers of studies are suggesting the high clinical value of imaging
examinations  especially high resolution computed tomography  HRCT  of the chest  in
patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia –  Typical CT imaging
manifestations include multiple patchy subsegmental or segmental ground glass
opacities  GGOs  and consolidation in the bilateral lungs  The imaging manifestations in patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia often
change rapidly  and many patients thus undergo repeated CT examinations 
Some
patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia gradually improve  whereas others develop
persistent hypoxemia or dyspnea and gradually worsen 
The changes in the patient s
condition are often closely related to the severity of the lung lesions 
Therefore 
observing the evolution of the lung lesions by chest CT is very important to assess
and predict the patient s outcome This study was to performed observe the changes in the chest HRCT manifestations of
  patients with pneumonia caused by SARS CoV  from the time of the initial
diagnosis 
To our knowledge  this is the largest population evaluated to date among
studies of the dynamic changes in imaging manifestations of novel coronavirus
pneumonia Consecutive patients were retrospectively enrolled in this single center study
from   January   to   February  
These patients met the Diagnosis and
Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia  trial version   issued by the National
Health Commission of the People s Republic of China  and their diagnoses were confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction 
According to the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus
Pneumonia  trial version   issued by the Chinese National Health Committee 
patients who developed severe pneumonia during their disease course were
excluded 
Severe pneumonia was defined as severe respiratory distress
 respiratory rate of   breaths minute  a requirement for oxygen treatment
or mechanical ventilation  an oxygen saturation of   on room air  a
partial arterial oxygen pressure fraction of inspired oxygen ratio of ≤  mmHg 
shock  or pneumonia combined with other organ failure All patients were examined using a Discovery CT  HD scanner  GE Healthcare 
Chicago  IL  USA  during a single inspiratory phase 
Before the examination  the
medical staff guided the patient to hold his or her breath and inhale 
After
complete exhalation  the patient held his or her breath  and a CT scan was
performed from the bottom of the lung to the apex of the lung 
The tube voltage
was   kVp with automatic tube current modulation 
The scan time was   s  the
scan interval was   mm  and the scan layer thickness was   mm 
After scanning 
adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction of   and the standard algorithm
were adopted  and the reconstruction layer thickness was   mm 
No contrast
agent was used during the CT scan 
Most patients underwent multiple chest CT
examinations  largely because the clinicians were still unclear about the
evolution tendencies of the lung lesions associated with COVID  pneumonia 
Additionally  some patients had symptoms such as hypoxemia or dyspnea due to
rapid disease progression 
Therefore  multiple chest CT examinations were
required to observe the progress or absorption of pneumonia The major CT manifestations were described using internationally standard
nomenclature defined by the Fleischner Society glossary  using terms such as
GGO  consolidation  and fibrous strips  A semi quantitative scoring system was used to estimate the pulmonary
involvement of all of these abnormalities on the basis of the area involved  Each of the five lung lobes was visually scored from   to   as follows 
  no involvement      involvement      to   involvement      to
  involvement      to   involvement  and     involvement 
The
total CT score was the sum of the individual lobar scores and ranged from    no
involvement  to    maximum involvement 
The number of affected lung lobes was
also recorded 
The images were transferred to an AW  workstation  GE
Healthcare  and anonymized 
All images were evaluated by two radiologists with
more than   years of work experience  and the final scores were determined by
consensus Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS Statistics for Windows  Version
   SPSS Inc  Chicago  IL  USA 
Measurement data are expressed as
mean   standard deviation  minimum–maximum  and categorical data are presented
as the percentage of the group 
A P value of   was defined as
statistically significant In total    CT scans of   patients   men    women  with confirmed COVID 
were collected 
The patients  ages ranged from   to   years  and their mean
age was       years 
Fever was the most common symptom  Table  
The patients
underwent        –  chest CT examinations  and the interval between the
first and last scan was       days  –  days The laboratory results are presented in Table  
Most laboratory results were
normal  with mildly elevated concentrations of C reactive protein
      mg L  D dimers       mg L  and ferritin

One patient had a  day history of cough with fever and was in Stage B
at the time of admission 
The frequencies of different lesions in different
stages are presented in Table  
Two patients in Stage A and one patient in Stage E had no
lesions 
Multiple lobes were involved in most of the CT scans in all stages 
Multiple lobe involvement was present in     patients in Stage A   
  in Stage B      in Stage C      in Stage D  and    
in Stage E  GGOs could be seen in all stages  and the proportion of GGOs in each
stage was similar 
The proportion of consolidation first increased and then
decreased over time 
GGOs and consolidation were present in     and  
  patients in Stage A      and     in Stage B     
and     in Stage C      and     in Stage D  and    
and     in Stage E  respectively 
The consolidations in some cases were
absorbed As shown in Table  
the total CT score also first increased and then decreased over time  and the
total CT score of pulmonary involvement was significantly higher in Stage B than
in Stage A       vs        respectively  P    
Additionally  the
total CT score of lung involvement was significantly higher in Stage C than in

The number of involved lobes was significantly higher
in Stage B than in Stage A       vs        respectively  P    
Notably  the CT score of the lower lobe was significantly higher than the
corresponding upper and middle lobes in Stages A  B  C  and D  P     for
all 
In Stage E  the CT score of the right lower lobe was significantly higher
than that of the right upper middle lobes  P     and P    
respectively  whereas no significant difference was observed in the CT score
between the left lower lobe and left upper lobe The CT images of a patient with novel coronavirus pneumonia are shown in Figure  
GGOs and
consolidation first increased from Stage A to Stage C  after which the
consolidation gradually absorbed  the GGOs then gradually decreased in Stages D
and E Since the end of   an outbreak of a novel pneumonia in Wuhan has been drawing
tremendous attention around the world 
Chinese government officials and researchers
have taken swift measures to control the outbreak and conduct etiological studies 
The causative agent of this pneumonia has been identified as SARS CoV  a novel
coronavirus 
As its name suggests  its genetic structure is   similar to that of SARS CoV The most frequently affected organ of the novel coronavirus is the lung 
In the
previous version of the diagnosis and treatment guideline for pneumonia caused by
novel coronavirus  the diagnosis was confirmed by the presence of viral nucleic
acids in throat swabs  sputum  and alveolar lavage fluid 
However  the more recent
guideline indicates that if typical chest CT findings are observed in patients
suspected to have COVID  the patient should be clinically diagnosed 
This
reflects the important role of chest CT in the diagnosis 
Moreover  current clinical
experience is showing that the chest CT manifestations change rapidly 
Therefore 
many patients in the present study underwent multiple repeated examinations during
treatment 
To our knowledge  this study is by far the largest case series of
follow up imaging among patients with COVID SARS CoV  infects human respiratory epithelial cells through S protein and has a
strong infection capacity for humans 
Coronavirus particles have a diameter of   to
  nm and can directly reach the bottom of the lung 
Because of lung volume and
gravity  respiratory airflow  and other factors  the type II alveolar epithelial
cells present at the bottom of the lung become the target cells of the coronavirus 
Therefore  the lesions are mainly distributed under the pleura or along the vascular
bronchial bundle  After the alveolar epithelial cells have become combined with the virus  the
alveolar wall is damaged and large numbers of immune cells and lymphocytes
accumulate  resulting in swelling around the lung leaflets and blood vessel
congestion 
The pulmonary lobules merge with each other  forming nodular or patchy
GGOs 
As the disease progresses  multiple lung segments become involved  the scope
of the lesion expands  the alveolar wall shrinks and collapses  and the exfoliated
and necrotic epithelium and the exuded inflammatory cells form a hyaline membrane 
These changes manifest as coexisting imaging abnormalities such as GGOs  nodules 
consolidation  and fibrous cord strips Several studies have focused on the evolution of CT changes in patients with COVID 
pneumonia 
Pan et al  analyzed the disease course according to  day stages and found that the CT
score was the highest on days   to   of the disease course  after   days  the CT
score of the lower lung was significantly higher than that of the middle and upper
lungs 
Zhou et al  found that CT images of patients with COVID  pneumonia showed a
predominantly peripheral  middle  lower  and posterior distribution 
The early rapid
progressive stage was   to   days from symptom onset  the advanced stage with peak
levels of CT abnormalities occurred from   to   days  and the abnormalities started
to improve after   days 
Lei et al  reported that patients with COVID  pneumonia had a typical transition from
the early stage to the advanced stage and then from the advanced stage to the
dissipating stage 
Single or multiple GGOs were distributed along the
bronchovascular or subpleural regions in the pulmonary parenchyma in the early
stage  higher density consolidations were observed in the advanced stage  and the
GGOs and consolidations were absorbed in the dissipating stage 
Xiang et al  evaluated only six patients with COVID  pneumonia and reported that the CT
score peaked at   to   days and that the CT scores of the lower lobes were
significantly higher than those of the middle upper lobes after   days from disease
onset 
These findings were consistent with those reported by Pan et al  Liang et al  reported that the majority of patients had involvement of three or more
lobes 
Bilateral involvement was more prevalent than unilateral involvement 
The
proportions of patients observed to have pure GGOs or GGOs and consolidation
decreased over time  while the proportion of patients with GGOs and linear opacities
increased 
The total severity score showed an increasing trend in the first   weeks 
Bernheim et al  divided the disease course into three stages  –   –  and  –  days  and
found that   of patients in the first stage had normal CT findings 
As the time
since onset of symptoms increased  the CT abnormalities became more frequent  these
findings included consolidation  bilateral and peripheral disease  greater total
lung involvement  linear opacities  the  crazy paving  pattern  and the  reverse
halo  sign In this study  we evaluated the CT findings of   patients with COVID  pneumonia
confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction 
The patients underwent
a mean of        range   –  chest CT examinations 
At present  the course of
COVID  pneumonia and when patients should be re examined remain inconclusive 
As
mentioned above  different studies have staged the disease according to different
time periods 
We grouped the patients  CT scans at different time intervals 
The
time interval grouping was based on current clinical experience and is consistent
with the imaging interval described in the pneumonia diagnosis and treatment guidelines  This grouping is also partially similar to that described by Pan et al  and Zhou et al  Multiple lobe involvement was observed in most patients in all stages  and
lower lobe lesions were significantly more common than upper and middle lobe
lesions  this is also consistent with the findings reported by Pan et al  and Liang et al  As mentioned above  most studies have suggested that patients with COVID 
pneumonia undergo a typical transition from the early stage to the advanced stage
and then from the advanced stage to the dissipating stage  however  the time to
reach the peak of the disease course varies among different studies  and the
patients in our study showed a similar tendency 
GGOs and consolidation were the
common chest CT manifestations  the proportion of GGOs in each stage was similar 
while consolidation and the total CT score first increased and then decreased over
time 
The total CT score was significantly higher in Stage B than in Stage A  while
the total CT score was significantly higher in Stage C than in Stage B 
These
findings suggest that the lung lesions of most patients significantly improved after
  days and that most patients with new coronavirus pneumonia had a disease course
of more than   days This study had three main limitations 
First  we did not consider the effects of
factors such as age  sex  medical history  including hypertension  hyperlipidemia 
hyperglycemia  and malignant tumors  and lifestyle habits  including smoking and
drinking history  on patient outcomes 
Second  although   patients with novel
coronavirus pneumonia were included in this study  the number of patients in Stages
B to E was limited 
Future studies should include more patients and extend the
observation time to ensure that the study results are more representative 
Third 
some studies have suggested that factors such as age  the C reactive protein
concentration  and the interleukin  β concentration may be related to patient
outcomes 
However  we did not perform a correlation analysis between the laboratory
data and patient outcomes In conclusion  we followed up and evaluated   chest CT scans of   patients with
confirmed COVID  pneumonia and found that most patients had a disease course of
more than   days and that the lung lesions of most patients improved significantly
after   days 
The purpose of this study is to help clinicians better understand the
disease course and properly perform chest CT re examinations for patients with
COVID  pneumonia to minimize the radiation dose Transdermal Delivery Systems for BiomoleculesDrug delivery is related to many problems focused on the molecular stability  pharmacokinetic  and amphoteric nature of a substance 
Due to chemical instability and high degradation by enzymatic action regardless of the distance to the specific target organ  all of this is more complicated when the bioactive substance that is intended to be administered is a biomolecule  such as peptides and proteins   Currently  there is a system that is applied to the protein drug delivery  which is a non conventional system developed primarily for protein and peptide drug delivery 
This new delivery system has a higher efficiency that improves the passage of the protein drug to the skin   
The transdermal drug delivery  TDD  system reduces potential exposure to side effects in the host and improves protein stability by also reducing enzymatic degradation  which is very common to occur when a drug takes the most conventional routes to enter the body  such as oral and subcutaneous routes 
Mainly  TDD systems avoid the first pass of metabolism  which occurs in the liver   
The protein and peptide drugs are important in many innovative treatments  such as immunotherapy  where biomolecules  such as antibodies  growth factors  and interleukins  are used 
These are proteins with high susceptibility to degradation to many endogenous and exogenous factors  such as temperature and pH  and most importantly  enzymatic degradation and immune clearance One of the most important advantages of the transdermal route is to maintain drug release in a constant and prolonged release to achieve optimal blood circulation concentrations   
For transdermal protein drug delivery systems  specific methods or devices are used to allow or enhance intact passage through the stratum corneum  SC 
The most suitable systems for the release of biomolecules are the third generation transdermal delivery systems  whose effects are directed to the SC 
For TDD systems of biomolecules and vaccines  thermal ablation and microneedles are the most widely used physical penetration enhancers 
However  there are many other systems that have been tested for transdermal release of biomolecules   that have been included in the second and third generation of transdermal delivery systems  such as iontophoresis and electroporation This article highlights the main technologies used as tools that improve transdermal protein drug delivery systems  addressing them from the point of view of research in the development of transdermal systems where many technologies and devices have a high possibility of use in conventional drug treatments  such as nanotechnology devices 
The authors provide an overview of the various systems that exist in TDD that have been tested and proposed for the transdermal delivery of biomolecules The skin is a three layer laminate that is made up of the SC  the epidermis  and the dermis   
The epidermis is the outermost layer and is formed from the stratified epithelium  the stratum germinativum  spinosum  granulosum  lucidum  and corneum   Fig 
 The SC is the outermost and impermeable skin layer that prevents the entry of most chemicals   
This barrier is formed by around   to   lines of dead keratinocytes  corneocytes  that have united with each other with corneodesmosomes forming a wall embedded in a lipidic matrix 
The extracellular matrix is formed by lipids  such as fatty acids  ceramides  cholesterol  cholesterol sulfate  and sterol wax esters arranged in lamellae  and multiple lipid bilayers  although the matrix is primarily composed of ceramides     
Corneocytes contain involucrin  loricrin  and cornifin around their periphery and have a thickness of   μm  but this can be modified by factors such as hydration and the anatomic site of the skin   
This stratum contains high amounts of keratin inside the corneocytes  and the keratin filaments provide the hexagonal shape and stratum mechanical strength of the corneocyte   
In addition  the SC acts as a barrier  preventing desiccation and pathogen entry and protecting against ultraviolet rays 
The SC also plays an important role in wound repair The transdermal delivery route has been used many times for the local application of therapeutic substances  and it is a practice that is still used and that will continue to grow in the coming years The transdermal drug delivery systems also allow homogeneous absorption and have good pharmaceutical efficiency  reducing the adverse effects that drugs could cause in the host and reduce the drug risk to suffer alterations caused by enzymatic factors and the immune system present in the intrinsic environment 
Besides that  these systems are more comfortable for the patient   This method is formed by steps that start when the therapeutic molecule enters the skin until it enters the blood circulation 
The first step is penetration  which occurs when the drug is deposited onto the specific skin layer 
Later  the permeation step occurs when the molecule diffuses from one layer to another 
Finally  in the resorption process  the drug enters the bloodstream     This type of drug delivery system has advantages over traditional systems because it can allow the storage of small amounts of drugs in the transport and delivery structure  which are developed by nanotechnology using mainly polymeric nanomaterials made with biopolymers  microneedles  and nanoparticles With these devices  it is possible to improve drug delivery and its bioavailability 
Thus  it is possible to reduce the frequency between drug administrations 
The most innovative property is that the device is only replaced when the dose is finished and it can take several days     
The exact side effects that they could trigger are unknown  since they could mainly depend on the type of bioactive drug it contains  which could be related to some effects of the mechanical properties of the skin    Table  Peptides and proteins have long been important resources in the treatment of many diseases 
Many of the therapies that are applied for many diseases have recently used peptides and proteins  which is called biological therapy and focuses on the production of the main proteins obtained from living organisms such as transforming bacteria The main diseases which are treated with proteins are diabetes  hemophilia  infectious diseases  and anemia 
These therapeutic proteins are primarily hormones  interleukins  anticoagulants  and enzymes  which are recombinant proteins 
Other protein drugs  such as calcitonin  rituximab  gemtuzumab  insulin  epidermal growth factor  and interferons  are best known for their importance in the treatment of osteoporosis  lymphoma  leukemia  and diabetes mellitus   The most employed biological protein therapy is immunotherapy  which has several applications 
One of the most important applications is cancer treatment  which is a specific treatment that employs cytokines  a kind of protein produced by the immunity system that helps the patient s immune system eliminate cancer cells and prevents the replication of cancer cells 
These immune proteins are classified in therapeutic groups known as cytokines  monoclonal antibodies  tyrosine kinase inhibitor  and rapamycin receptor inhibitors in mammals  mTOR    
Two main kinds of cytokines are the most importantly used in biological therapies  interleukins and interferons 
Production is carried out with laboratory animals and once extracted and purified  they are used by injection into a human recipient for clinical treatment  e g  monoclonal antibodies 
However  there are many applications for products  such as antibodies obtained from live organisms and these are used mainly for the prevention of diseases such as in the development of vaccines 
The most important pharmaceutical products are listed in Table     Each one of these peptides or proteins has a different method of administration  such as intravenous  oral  topical  or intravesical 
Some other proposed methods of administration that would avoid the difficulties of the route of administration and offer comfort to the user include the nasal  pulmonary  ocular  and rectal routes    which could be as invasive as the traditional routes in many cases 
The main drawback of this type of therapies is that traditional administration such as subcutaneous injection and intravenous administration can modify their effectiveness  since the route of administration may vary in different clinical circumstances  for example  it may contribute to an increase in blood pressure   When any substance  including proteins  enters the bloodstream regardless of the route of administration  these proteins are exposed to many environmental threats such as sequestration by the reticuloendothelial system mainly for macrophage internalization  enzymatic degradation and absorption and elimination of serum proteins by the liver  –   which is an important factor to consider  since it represents a low efficiency in the application of biological therapy due to its high rate of degradation and elimination   
In addition to protecting the lability of all therapeutic proteins  it is also about preventing them from exerting their activity in places that do not require it 
Although immunotherapy is more effective and less toxic than therapies made with chemical molecules  these immune proteins also trigger adverse effects in the host  such as autoimmunities and non specific inflammatory processes   
For these reasons  research is being carried out on the use of alternative technologies with which these side effects can be controlled  such as with the use of nanotechnology using polymers  with which these proteins can be protected  favoring their transport and direct delivery to their objective  preventing them from exerting their toxic effect on non specific cells and sites   Nanocarriers  such as nanotubes    microneedles  MNs   –   fusion peptide carriers    or peptide conjugated nanoparticles  NPs      are some of the main carriers and protective systems used in immunotherapy  regardless of the size or structure of the molecule to be transported and protected  which could be genetic material  interferon  interleukins  or antibodies In   the US FDA approved the use of TDD systems and their use has been increasing in relevance for protein drugs because for some molecules these delivery systems improve the solubility of the compound  in addition to allowing it to pass efficiently through the skin There are important findings in research revealing that TDD technologies allow the loading  transport  and release of protein drugs 
They are very promising for the effective treatment of local cancers  with skin location  and they have a second benefit of activating the immune system from a remote distance 
Some of them have been developed to carry ribonucleic acid  RNA  that can regulate localized gene expression within a known target 
In other cases  it is possible to use an immunologic protein that could produce a strong adaptive immune response against a specific antigen in the case of vaccines  where it could be made with the tumor antigen expressed in the gene  tumor related protein or peptide  specific epitope  or cell lysate   For immunotherapy  it might be possible to employ monoclonal antibody loaded TDD systems and tumor agnostic therapies  non specific immunotherapies  use of interferons and interleukins  and cancer theranostic treatment where SC could be interrupted by a nanogel delivering a drug through the skin and allowing it to accumulate at the tumor site   or these systems may even function by delivering vaccine antigens  cancer vaccines  using nanoparticles and liposomes as antigenic carriers loaded on nanogels to pass the antigen through the SC by iontophoresis   
It is also possible to use microneedles loaded with Dermatophagoides farinae extract to achieve effective allergen release and effective immune response induction   These strategies have a wide range of application in various skin pathological circumstances  in addition to their main role in cancer therapy  and many products are used for the treatment of cancer 
Some of the commercial pharmaceutical products used for cancer therapy  which are administered transdermally  are described in Table     Through the use of transdermal delivery systems  it is sought to increase the solubility and stability  the circulating life  and the pharmacokinetic properties of drug proteins and peptides 
It is recommended to consider that the TDD system is not applicable to many of the biomolecules that are used as medical treatments since the success in the transdermal passage could depend on certain factors 
The efficacy of this therapeutic system depends both on the physical and chemical properties of the proteins and on the percutaneous administration systems of biomolecules to be used 
Regarding protein  the main physical properties to consider are the shape and size  molecular weight  solubility  and amphoteric nature  the latter being perhaps one of the most important to consider since due to its amphoteric property it can migrate in an electric field and its migration direction depends on the net charge that it has 
The knowledge of this property could help to elucidate which are the best percutaneous administration systems to facilitate passage through the SC 
In the case of charged proteins  physical  electrical  enhancers are the best option to use 
The chemical nature of proteins is another especially important factor to know 
This composition could help us to choose the best TDD system through which the protein will pass through the SC avoiding the reactivity of some functional groups of proteins 
For these reasons  there is little increase in the development of new therapeutic formulations administered by TDD systems  since there are some protein properties that need to be studied and analyzed to know if they can be administered by this route without affecting its stability and pharmacokinetic properties Peptides are molecules that have a molecular weight between   Da and   kDa 
This molecular weight depends on the molecular structures and their lengths with a small amount of amino acids or constitutes a protein with a complex structure 
These molecules are charged in a physiological pH and are hydrophilic  which complicates their permeability across the skin 
Some drugs have a lower or higher affinity with the lipophilic condition of the SC  which determines the quantity of the molecule that can cross this layer of the skin naturally 
Therefore  it is better to use a technique that improves passage to the skin  using or not natural permeation molecular routes avoiding the degradation of peptides or proteins and ensuring passage and integrity during the transport and release processes   There are important skin conditions that can change permeability  such as age  heat  racial differences  freezing  abrasion  chemical irritant activity  and some diseases such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis 
It is very important to recognize these for the development and use of devices employed in transdermal protein drug delivery In the skin  three molecular permeation routes are the most important  intracellular  intercellular  and follicular routes 
All of these are beneficiated by the concentration gradient of the molecules present in the milieu  allowing passive diffusion across the SC   
Moreover  physicochemical properties from the molecule affect its passage through the SC 
Hydrophobic molecules can cross the SC intercellularly  whereas hydrophilic molecules cross intracellularly by corneocytes 
Passage through the skin can take place through so called cutaneous defects  in which the skin has a discontinuity  such as sweat glands or hair shafts   In the skin  the SC and lipid layers have a barrier function  as both prevent the loss of water and avoid the entry of any substances  molecules  or microorganisms from the environment or microbiome 
These layers play a crucial role in the passive passage of proteins and other chemicals into the skin 
The liquid flux between the lipid layer depends on the lamellar and linear lipid matrix arrangement 
The lamellar layer is generally oriented parallel to the SC  and linear lipids are perpendicular to the SC 
If no long periodicity phase  LPP  exists  the permeability increases   
However  if the orthorhombic phase  OP  predominates  the permeability of the lipids is reduced  and if the OP predominates in the lateral layer  the permeation decreases   
The LPP is primarily formed by ceramides  cholesterol  and free fatty acids  and these have a unique tri layer organization  while an all trans chain lipid organization exists in the OP phase  which has a rectangular crystalline lattice and no mobility Transdermal drug delivery has been used for many years  and the skin was thought to be impervious to exogenous chemical molecules 
Currently  it is known that the skin is a semi permeable barrier  which allows its use as a transport route for molecules  allowing the molecule to reach the therapeutic target intact 
However  due to its anatomy  hydrophilic molecules can only pass through the skin if they are small  and even then  in many cases  they require help from an electric field  electrotherapies  as in the case of electroporation   and iontophoresis   
These techniques use a low voltage supplementation  direct current  around the drug site  allowing and enhancing passage through the skin   
When an electric field is applied to the skin  a large molecular movement occurs and the molecule can take the path of the hair follicle through the skin or induce pore formation     There is another technology using acoustic transmission  sonophoresis  that is used in medical trials  such as hyperthermia treatment  physical therapy  and ultrasonic surgery  which has the ability to facilitate drug transport to the skin   
Through this technique  mechanical waves of medium or low frequency are transferred to a physical medium  such as a specific gel  which allows it to propagate and transmit energy 
In the ultrasonic system  wave sounds have an oscillation frequency greater than   kHz   The TDD systems are an alternative route that allows the control of the drug release and decreases the possibility of any side effects associated with levels that are higher than the minimum pharmacological concentration  reducing pharmacological dosing times because a patch is administered every   to   h  This eliminates the risk of metabolism of the therapeutic agent and the loss of the available dose 
In addition  there are other advantages  such as the noninvasive drug delivery method  which can be discontinued at any time   
To facilitate TDD to improve SC permeation  some technologies improve drug flux of difficult drugs    such as cryioneumatic and photpneumatic technologies  sonphoresis  iontophoresis  electroporation  jet injection  and MN  which are used in the delivery of many drugs   The disadvantage in the above cases is that all devices require a low voltage supplement 
In addition  it is necessary to purchase equipment to manage the electrical current 
In addition  in some people it can cause sensitivity  such as tingling and irritation  and the technique can even cause blistering of the skin 
In these cases  when the technique is not well applied  it can cause burns to the skin 
In all circumstances  these techniques must be applied by trained personnel Despite these drawbacks  considerable research has been focused on the transport of peptides through the skin with good results 
In Table   we list some examples of these studies  the biomolecules and penetration enhancers  and the main result of each 
The table also indicates whether the physical penetration enhancer acts alone or is enhanced by a combination with another enhancer or nanocarrier    –  Many compounds have been employed to improve the penetration of substances across the skin  such as azone  pyrrolidones  alkanols  sulfoxides  glycols  alcohols  and surfactants   
Each of the chemical penetration enhancers has a specific action mechanism in the skin penetration process Due to the characteristics of the upper layer of the skin  which is specialized in avoiding and preventing the entry of any molecule or pathogen  the SC is complicated in terms of the passage of molecules greater than   Da  but it is not impossible 
In many cases  this process can be carried out using penetration enhancer molecules  which have good results in terms of penetration of molecules through the skin 
However  it represents a disadvantage because it could permit not only pathogens but also microorganisms in the cutaneous microbiota to enter as a consequence of cellular disruption integrity and the focal detachment of superficial corneocytes  such as in the use of thioglycolate in depilatory treatments   
The process of percutaneous absorption of a therapeutic molecule consists of several processes  which include the dissolution and release of the therapeutic agent  partition and diffusion within the SC  partition from the SC to the aqueous phase of the epidermis and its diffusion  and finally  access to the systemic circulation and target tissue There are three routes through which any molecule can breach this and reach the microcirculation through the tissue 
These are the intercellular  transcellular  and transappendageal routes  but the route can depend on the drug s molecular weight  Fig 
    Chemical penetration enhancers are a good alternative to allow the passage of biomolecules  but most of them cause skin irritation  which is uncomfortable for patients   
In many cases  the penetration enhancers have synergic activity when they are used in combination    but they can generate more skin irritation problems 
The mode of action of these enhancers is different for each one and depends on the mechanism by which it interacts with the compounds of the SC 
Due to this capacity  it has been classified according to their interaction ability in those that  a  interact with lipid heads within aqueous domains of the lipid bilayers and interact with the lipid alkyl chain   b  interact with actin filaments in the corneocytes   c  allow partitioning augmentation and increase drug protein solubility in the SC  and  d  improve penetration indirectly  modifying the drug  Fig 
    
Some of the most studied chemical penetration enhancers are the terpenes  amide  fatty acids  monoglycerides  and surfactants  and some of the most commonly studied are  D limonene  azone  lauric acid  monoolein and sodium lauryl sulfate   Depending on their chemical structure  some polymers can transport drug molecules within their structure  as in the case of cyclodextrins and their derivatives together with other saccharides  moieties  that can transport drugs as ketoprofen   or biomolecules such as levothyroxine sodium  T  which has been used as a topical treatment to eliminate lipid deposits in subcutaneous adipose tissue 
The main problem with this type of application has been the IT  detection in rabbits   h after the application of the cream 
The use of dimethyl cyclodextrin as a solubilizer for levothyroxine increased its solubility  but unfortunately  it only succeeded in penetrating much less levothyroxine through the skin than the required dose in humans   
In this way  it is important to highlight that the complex improves the solubility of the molecule allowing it to pass through the SC  and in another specific treatment  it could recognize a specific target in the cell plasma membrane and then adhere to it and release its content in a more efficient way Proteins are a substantial problem when we try to pass them through the skin 
First  they are larger  and second  they are highly susceptible to enzymatic degradation 
Not all are thermostable  and finally  another difficulty is that proteins and peptides live for a short time in plasma 
For this  it is necessary to protect them during their trip to the place of action 
Furthermore  this protection enables controlled delivery 
Passing through the skin can be less difficult if the protein is in a capsule  which is best when the capsule size is in the nanometric range Advances in the science of polymers applied in pharmacy have allowed the development of many encapsulation techniques that range from the most impractical to the most revolutionary methods 
However  this reveals a problem  as some polymers are not soluble in water and require organic solvents 
Furthermore  the integrity of the protein to be encapsulated is compromised regardless of the encapsulation technique Many types of polymers could be used in drug delivery  however  their chemical structure and molecular weight do not allow dissolution in water in many cases  and most dissolve well in organic solvents 
The solubility of the polymer is a characteristic that is important to determine before use because it can determine the environmental resistance in the process in which it will be used Biopolymers and their combinations are best used for these procedures  helping to improve the stability of the formulation as in the case of encapsulating transforming growth factor  TGF β  in poly d l lactic co glycolic acid   PLGA  and polyethylene glycol  PEG  polymeric microparticles for bone regeneration   
Insulin loaded PCL PEG PCL NPs are another example where the NPs were prepared by the w o w double emulsion solvent evaporation method and demonstrated satisfactory insulin delivery and efficacy in treating diabetic rats   
These NPs possess a specific protein drug delivery with a delivery degradation speed 
They are hydrophobic or hydrophilic according to what is necessary for the encapsulation procedure and for improvement in the stability of the protein drug 
They have a low or no chance of rejection and are safe to use Encapsulation processes are classified into two types  chemical and mechanical  which are then classified according to the methodology used to make the capsule 
This can be determined according to the desired size  shape  and composition surface chemistry 
The encapsulation of biomolecules by these methods allows us to avoid the degradation of the free protein and allows the prolonged and constant release of a protein drug in constant time     With these methods  it is possible to obtain nano sized particles  which are especially important to avoid their elimination by the immune system and the liver   
Smaller and softer particles can better evade the immune system  and this can be compatible with the recipient organism 
It is important to note that capsules with a diameter size of ≤  μm have the risk of being engulfed by phagocytic immune cells  therefore  the recommended NP size that could have an appropriate delivery range is   to   nm   Dendrimers are three dimensional NPs  like macromolecules  and are considered based on nanometric size 
These are radially symmetric and comprise an inner core structure made up of a central atom covalently bonded between other atoms 
The external composition is highly branched  forming a dendrimer structure 
These branches allow the formation of cavities into which bioactive molecules   can be incorporated  such as proteins   and peptides used for many pathological treatments   and for storage  transport  and controlled delivery There are many types of dendrimer structures  and depending on the synthesis method  these methods could use click chemistry   and divergent and convergent strategies 
In addition  there are different designs and chemical elements 
Their application in the administration of drugs has focused on the fact that these have many biocompatible characteristics 
These characteristics include non immunogenicity  non toxicity  and a high ability to cross biological barriers  such as cell membranes  blood vessels  intestines  and the blood brain barrier   In addition  they have high stability in blood circulation and a prolonged blood circulation half life  and they target specific structures 
These NPs can be manufactured in high purity and have some degree of in vitro toxicity when manufactured with cationic and anionic surface groups 
However  it is possible to reduce this toxicity by using surface protection by PEGs or fatty acids   In TDD systems  dendrimers have been employed for the penetration of nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs  such as indomethacin  which is an arthritis and osteoarthritis auxiliary drug in the treatment of the pain generated from this disease 
There is a study that reports the progress of the TAT PAMAM dendrimer system developed as a non viral vector for the transdermal release of DNA plasmids where the dendrimer system was modified 
The HIV transcriptional transactivator  TAT  was conjugated as a cell penetrating peptide to enhance the uptake of constructed plasmid DNA pIRES H GFP by cells   
Dendrimers are an excellent drug penetration enhancer   and they are some of the best nanostructures that have high applicability in medicine for the delivery of peptides and proteins As mentioned  traditional routes  intradermal  gastric  or intravenous  have long been the main delivery route for all drugs 
Nevertheless  the appearance of an increase in chronic diseases has allowed the development of new technologies that are less invasive and have high efficiency upon reaching the target  especially in cases in which a user must take more than one medicine for the treatment of one or more diseases at a time Although the design and use of MNs can ensure the entrance of molecules across the skin  biomolecules have a high degradation risk that can occur at any time  in the charging process or at the moment of release 
Thus  it is better to protect the protein contained within a specialized structure  such as nanocapsules or dendrimers  NPs in both cases 
This procedure has no danger for the protein or peptide structural composition  which improves the conservation and passage of these compositions across the SC  Fig 
 The PLGA NPs can go through SC better with the help of MNs because the micro conduits created by these needles allow the NPs to avoid the SC barrier and arrive at other skin layers and deliver the complete contents  Fig 
    
For this procedure  it is necessary to consider that  in all cases  the penetration capacity of NPs depends on the particle and channel size   
Despite this important consideration  among others  the procedure also avoids the limitations of the skin s physicochemical properties that do not permit crossing it Some experimental studies have demonstrated the penetration and distribution of PLGA NPs in MNs   
The most common use of NPs MNs is for experimental insulin release systems using murine models in rats with induced diabetes  where the insulin is introduced into H O responsive mesoporous silica NPs  and MN patches are manufactured for later transdermal application 
Its release behavior analysis demonstrated effective release   
For immunity induction  an excellent response occurs when the NPs MNs were employed 
For example  for the induction of immunity against endogenous prostate cancer stem cell antigen RALA pPSCA  the immunization via the NP MN release system resulted in anti tumor activity in both cases of prophylactic and treatment assays in vivo   
Another experimental process that allows probing the system efficacy is the use of poly methylmethacrylate  coated with   nm of gold NPs  which has great potential in tumoral cell destruction   Currently  there are few authorized devices  however  these are increasing because for many treatments  such devices are more appropriately used  effective  and exhibit more recommended results 
Perhaps shortly  these devices will be the most appropriate techniques for drug and protein delivery systems For many decades  a great number of therapies to resolve the problems associated with drug release have been implicated to probe numerous kinds of devices and pharmaceutical innovations to solve many diseases or applications in various clinical trials for the diagnosis of diseases or treatments of diseases 
For this application  it is necessary to design new technologies  and pharmaceutical chemistry has been concerned with offering the best administration methods for therapeutic agents Lately  many research studies have reported numerous results that indicate the most appropriate technologies to use in each case of a drug delivery system 
Each of the aforementioned TDD systems has some advantages and disadvantages for use in administering protein drug delivery However  these technologies create substantial and important opportunities for administering biomolecules

Measurements were performed in duplicate The importance of feedback for surgical teams during the COVID  pandemic
Editor
As new research has emerged about COVID  transmission  personal protective equipment  PPE  and patient management guidelines have evolved 
This has led to rapid guideline changes within healthcare systems 
Conflicting guidelines can contribute to miscommunication  increased stress  and reduced cohesion among surgical teams 
To successfully implement new guidelines during times of crisis  specific and timely feedback can be used to identify and resolve breaches in infection control  and promote feelings of support among healthcare workers Although inherently less complex than live surgery  feedback in stressful simulated scenarios can provide information about common pitfalls and provide a safe environment in which to practice new skills 
Our group found that when under stress  mental practice coaching combined with feedback significantly enhanced performance compared to simulation alone by better preparing individuals to execute action 
Feedback and mental rehearsal can help improve individuals  knowledge of guidelines and confidence in their abilities to perform under stress 
Critical skills to master in this new environment include PPE donning and doffing  performing procedures on COVID positive patients while in PPE  and new workflow protocols Within normal workflow  new technical skills and adherence to new operative safety protocols may be improved by video based feedback 
In a randomized study  coached trainees using video feedback made approximately half the number of technical errors when compared with those receiving conventional training 
This coaching has been extremely well received when implemented in multidisciplinary teams 
Non technical performance can also be improved through structured curricula combined with debriefing and feedback Under the best of circumstances  it can be challenging to provide the feedback necessary to maintain and improve individual and team performance 
Our team developed the operating room  OR  Black Box®  Surgical Safety Technologies  Inc    a technology that continuously captures and synchronizes multiple sources of intraoperative video and audio data 
Postoperatively  analysts identify safety threats and resilience supports that may respectively contribute to  or help to avoid adverse events  so targeted interventions can be implemented to promote patient safety 
Over the last ten years  our group has researched effective ways to reduce surgical error and optimize surgical safety using feedback – To address the need for feedback during the COVID pandemic at our institution  we developed the COVID Black Box 
Data from simulation scenarios on COVID positive patients recorded via the COVID Black Box is assessed to detect breaches in infection control practices  and identify suboptimal performance for improvement 
Specific and timely feedback is provided to equip OR personnel on how to correct misinformation  improve responses  and facilitate behavioural change on an operative team level 
Although formal analysis has yet to be conducted  qualitative downstream effects of feedback observed include an increased sense of control  reduced stress  improved team communication  feelings of managerial support  and more positive attitudes indicative of the organizational safety culture During this global pandemic  hospitals and surgical departments should not underestimate the importance of providing their teams with feedback 
Hospitals without comprehensive recording capabilities should establish systematic methods of providing feedback to OR teams such as video recording operations or assigning dedicated observers to record breaches in safety practices 
This feedback should be presented to surgical teams immediately and continuously  and collated for the larger institution on a regular basis to transparently communicate lessons learned from previous surgical cases 
Specific and timely feedback may reduce preventable errors in surgery during the pressures of the pandemic 
With ongoing effort to support our surgical teams and better performance  we can help our front line OR staff and patients during both the first  and subsequent waves of this pandemic The Global COVID‐  Observatory and Resource Center for Childhood Cancer  A response for the pediatric oncology community by SIOP and St  Jude GlobalAfter rapidly spreading across the globe  COVID‐  officially became a pandemic on March    
 
 Initial reports suggested that patients with comorbidities were at higher risk  causing concern that children with cancer were at risk of developing severe infection 
 
 Furthermore  measures to mitigate the spread of the virus  such as delaying medical procedures and travel restrictions  were anticipated to disturb the continuity of pediatric cancer care 
 
 It was also anticipated that the effects of the pandemic on health systems would amplify existing obstacles to caring for children with cancer 
 

Since the beginning of the pandemic  a deluge of information regarding disease characteristics and possible management strategies was disseminated 
This infodemic  an overabundance of information during an epidemic 
 
 has posed challenges never encountered before and was an early concern 
 
 The rapid spread of information and misinformation  potentiated by social media platforms  presented a public health challenge  confusing and overwhelming healthcare professionals and lay public alike In response to the need for a trusted resource with curated  reliable information and a platform to share experiences for the pediatric oncology community  the International Society of Pediatric Oncology  SIOP  and St  Jude Children s Research Hospital  SJCRH  created the Global COVID‐  Observatory and Resource Center for Childhood Cancer  GCORCCC 
The GCORCCC was launched as an open‐access website  covid childhoodcancer org  on April    The Resource Library contains updated curated peer‐reviewed manuscripts  guidance documents  and links relevant to the multidisciplinary care of children with cancer during COVID‐ 
 
 Publications are reviewed and assessed for relevance weekly for inclusion 
 
 We prioritize the dissemination of accurate data and quickly identify and address misinformation or conflicting reports 
Only peer‐reviewed articles are included  as unvetted scientific information  such as preprints  were identified as a risk for misinformation for providers 
 
  
 

The sections of the Resource Library are as follows  COVID‐  and Pediatric Oncology  General COVID‐  Information  Treatment  Prevention  For Healthcare Providers  and For Patients and Families 
Each section provides a collection of publications  guidance documents  recorded webinars  and relevant links To address the needs of healthcare professionals during this unprecedented time  resources focusing on leadership  self‐care  and resiliency are also included in the Resource Library 
Additionally  a subsection specifically aimed at nurses  with literature and guidance documents  was developed 
The Pediatric Oncology Nursing during COVID‐  Fact Sheet summarizes the most relevant guidance for caring for children with cancer and is available in six languages as a quick bedside reference 
Finally  a section with resources for patients and families aids bedside providers in educating and navigating patients and families toward trusted  accurate sources of information At the beginning of the pandemic  the natural history of COVID‐  in children and adolescents with cancer was unknown 
To gain an accurate picture of the burden of COVID‐  among this patient population  we developed the Global COVID‐  Registry 
Healthcare providers worldwide were invited to voluntarily report any patient  under   years of age  with a malignancy or history of hematopoietic stem cell transplant at the time of a laboratory‐confirmed SARS‐CoV‐  infection 
The Registry was approved by the SJCRH Institutional Review Board As of December      cases from   countries have been reported 
Using aggregate data  we created an interactive data visualization dashboard to provide updates in a dynamic format  Figure  
The data visualization allows providers to filter cases by variables such as underlying diagnosis  cancer treatment  and COVID‐  outcomes Creating an opportunity to bring the global community of healthcare professionals together is an essential component of the GCORCCC 
The Collaboration Space provides a forum for healthcare professionals to interact and share their experiences and questions about caring for children with cancer during the COVID‐  pandemic 
The Collaboration Space has language translation capabilities  making it accessible to a large number of providers globally 
Here  users are also able to access content  such as videos  blog posts  and live events Through sharing experiences  providers can support and learn from each other 
From the Frontlines is a blog series published to highlight unique accounts of childhood cancer providers navigating COVID‐  around the world 
To date  the blog features stories from   providers in   countries 
These providers discuss the challenges their teams have faced and innovative solutions they have employed to continue to treat children with cancer during the pandemic 
Currently  there are   total active users registered in the Collaboration Space who have connected and interacted over   times with content elements A rapidly evolving pandemic poses many challenges in caring for children with cancer 
The GCORCCC established a mechanism to generate and transfer knowledge for the pediatric oncology community during a global pandemic and infodemic 
Through its various elements  users can access relevant information to help them adapt and respond to the rapidly shifting situation Academic institutions and professional societies should play central roles in the accurate and timely dissemination of information 
For professionals caring for children with cancer  the sharing of experiences from regions that were affected early in the pandemic was essential for formulating the initial responses to the evolving pandemic 
 
  
 
  
 
In addition  guidance for the management of COVID‐  for different patient populations was generated by government agencies and professional societies with remarkable speed 
 
  
 
  
 
Importantly  information sufficiency has been linked to less stress and worry amongst health care professionals 
 
 For this reason  a resource like the GCORCCC can support individuals to decrease burn out and improve resilience 
This effort brought colleagues together and facilitated a sense of community in these trying times  in an innovative approach to addressing global challenges in pediatric cancer care 
Many organizations attempted to compile listing of resources that are relevant to their specific populations  but few of them also sought to create knowledge about COVID‐  in their populations to add to the evidence‐based literature At a time of exceptionally high stakes for children with cancer  the multi‐stakeholder collaboration that led to the GCORCCC represents a framework for global cooperative efforts in the future 
SIOP and SJCRH formed a partnership aimed at disseminating the GCORCCC widely and rapidly throughout the global network  leveraging the strengths of both organizations 
This platform shows that novel  dynamic information resources can help provide guidance to frontline providers across the globe  facilitating the rapid sharing and adoption of new information in highly dynamic situations 
The collaborations built through this rapid multidisciplinary implementation and global dissemination process provide a foundation upon which the global community can collectively build to ultimately improve outcomes for all children with cancer everywhere In memoriam  This manuscript is dedicated to Dr  Arturo Moreno  past president of SLAOP SIOP Latin America  a tireless advocate for children with cancer in Mexico  Latin America  and the world The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest The Psychodynamic Approach During COVID  Emotional CrisisThe health emergency we are experiencing due to COVID  has strongly influenced not only physical health but also the mental health of the general population as well as collective behavior  Gray et al    Orrù et al   b  Lenzo et al   
The understanding of mental health consequences must consider individual emotional responses associated with the ongoing stressful experience of the COVID  pandemic  Di Giuseppe et al   a  Venuleo et al   
Negative emotions such as fear  anger  frustration and significant economic worries are associated with higher levels of anxiety  depression  sleep disturbances  maladaptive behaviors  and psychosomatic symptoms  Conversano et al   b  Franceschini et al    Parola et al   
As expected  the severity of clinical conditions is observed to be higher in vulnerable groups such as children  the elderly  psychiatric patients  and front line workers  Aafjes van Doorn et al   b  Elbay et al    Elkholy et al    Merlo et al    Shen et al    Singh et al    Orrù et al   
Research has demonstrated that emotion regulation plays a key role in stress management and adaptation helping the individual to cope with discharged feelings and thoughts related to the COVID  crisis  communication of the final stage of the individual s life  Iasevoli et al    and  therefore  protecting them from developing clinical levels of psychological distress  Di Giuseppe et al   e  Prout et al    Walker and McCabe   
The role of dynamic psychotherapy is essential in moderating people s emotional reactions  although its implementation requires the adjustment of therapeutic strategies enhancing adaptation and resilience  Aafjes van Doorn et al   a  Békés et al   
From this perspective  it is imperative to improve public awareness and establish adequate procedures and prompt responses of intervention Due to uncertainty surrounding COVID  collective distress and individual suffering  the psychodynamic approach may be able to consistently identify and manage stressful life event dynamics  Afari et al    Di Giuseppe et al   a  as well as fostering emotional regulation in order to prevent possible relevant factors involved in the pathogenesis of both psychological and psychosomatic syndromes  Lenzo et al    Martino et al   a b  Conversano and Di Giuseppe    Sardella et al   
This is of particular relevance at present with many experiencing grief and sorrow for the loss of a family member  a reduction of freedom  changes in daily routines and fears associated with uncertainty and the intolerance of uncertainty  Conversano et al   a  Orrù et al   a 
In response to these stressors  the individual activates unconscious defense mechanisms  psychological strategies that help in reducing the anxiety associated with the awareness of internal conflicts and externally charged situations  Perry    American Psychiatric Association   
Since defense mechanisms are hierarchically organized and own specific psychological functions  they may cause a wide number of negative consequences as well as playing a significant role as protective factors against psychological distress and psychopathological symptoms caused by the COVID  outbreak  Marazziti et al   
The use of high adaptive defense mechanisms promotes increased awareness of one owns feelings related to difficult life experiences and leads to better adjustment and resilience  whereas the use of immature defenses protects the self from painful feelings and thoughts at the cost of developing maladaptive affective  cognitive and relational disfunctions  Di Giuseppe et al    Perry et al   
Recent studies demonstrate that specific therapeutic intervention may increase the overall defensive maturity and improve psychological well being and adjustment  Hoffman et al    Prout et al   b    Di Giuseppe et al   d In this opinion article the relevance of the implementing psychodynamic approach in the prevention of individuals  mental health during the ongoing COVID  crisis has been highlighted 
In accordance with Marčinko et al 
  the inclusion of psychodynamic interventions within the public mental health emergency system is recommended  considered as an effective strategy in reinforcing the individual s well being both during and after the COVID  pandemic crisis 
The application of specific therapeutic interventions derived from the psychodynamic approach can enhance emotion regulation and adaptive responses as the COVID  pandemic progresses Understanding how the ongoing pandemic is influencing human reactions to such a stressful event is essential for developing ad hoc effective interventions 
The systematic assessment of unconscious psychological aspects of personality should be promoted for the early detection of vulnerable individuals and for improving research and clinical practice toward a personalized therapeutic approach  Lingiardi and McWilliams    Lingiardi et al    Tanzilli et al    Barber and Solomonov    Talia et al    Di Giuseppe et al   c  Zilcha Mano and Ramseyer   The author confirms being the sole contributor to this work and approves it for publication The author declares that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest Coping with COVID  An Examination of the Role of  Non Religiousness Non SpiritualityThe COVID  pandemic represents a global collective trauma event  Duane et al 
  and is among the first such events to disrupt and compromise the physical and emotional safety and lives of all United States  U S  Americans in the contemporary era 
Due to the novel nature of the current pandemic and diverse challenges  e g  social isolation  economic hardship  mental and physical health  grief  the utility of commonly employed coping strategies is unknown 
In general  adaptive coping strategies are associated with positive outcomes  whereas maladaptive coping strategies are associated with distress  Lazarus et al 
 
However  extant literature exploring coping strategies used in response to large scale disasters often emphasizes the utility of religious and spiritual coping  in particular  Aten et al 
  and excludes nonreligious and or nonspiritual people  Hwang et al 
 
Such studies may erroneously infer that nonreligious nonspiritual people are detrimentally impacted by the absence of religious spiritual  R S  coping despite their omission from participation 
In fact  little is known about the manner by which nonreligious and nonspiritual people cope with large scale events with the potential for individual and collective trauma  an omission the current study sought to address Collective traumas are events that disrupt daily life for an entire community and include natural and human caused disasters  Erickson   Silver et al 
  as well as sociopolitical oppressions  Comas Díaz et al 
  Kelly et al 
 
These shared traumatic events often deteriorate the sense of safety and security of those affected  Silver et al 
  and have negative psychological consequences  Goldmann et al 
  Luszczynska et al 
 
Though destruction and disruption often remain following such disasters  pandemics  including the COVID  pandemic  differ from other natural  e g  weather related  and human made  e g  mass shootings  disasters in the sustained nature of the event itself Symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder  PTSD  including depressive and anxious symptoms  are possible in response to collective trauma  Goldmann et al 
  but vary in prevalence  Bonanno   Neria et al 
 
Many factors other than the traumatic event likely influence the presentation of psychological symptoms  including disruption distress  social support and coping  Baral et al 
 
Survivors of the SARS pandemic in Hong Kong and Taiwan reported trauma related and other psychological symptoms including hopelessness  alienation and long term changes to mental and physical health 
Similar to COVID  in addition to illness and death  social and economic disruption accompanied SARS  Lei et al 
 
Though previous exposure to such collective trauma events likely increases resilience to future traumatic events  Bonanno et al 
  the U S  has not been significantly disrupted by a similar pandemic  e g  requiring physical distancing  face coverings  hand hygiene  widespread disruptions to schooling and employment  in over   years 
Therefore  US residents may experience more psychological consequences and possess fewer coping resources than people living in countries significantly impacted by recent  similar pandemics Coping refers to use of processes aimed at reducing  tolerating  or mastering stress 
In general  Lazarus et al 
  in response to natural and human made disasters  Cherry et al 
  Shing et al 
  and in the face of other global health crises like HIV AIDS  Blashill et al 
  emotion focused  e g  acceptance  positive reframing  and problem focused  e g  instrumental support  planning  coping  or adaptive coping strategies  are more effective than strategies categorized as dysfunctional or maladaptive  e g  denial  venting  substance use 
Further  the nature of the traumatic event may influence the effectiveness of coping strategies such that temporary losses may benefit from different techniques as compared to more permanent losses or changes  Shing et al 
 In a study of over   adults in Spain during a country wide COVID  lockdown    of participants reported anxious or depressive symptoms 
Lower levels of anxious and or depressive symptoms were associated with maintaining a healthy diet  avoiding news updates related to COVID  talking with friends and relatives  pursuing hobbies  spending time outdoors and following a routine  Fullana et al 
 
In April   in the U S  a national sample recruited online via MTurk reported most commonly using distraction  active coping and social support in response to COVID 
Of note  woman identified participants were more likely to use multiple emotion focused strategies  including religious support  whereas participants who were young  financially insecure  or identified as a sexual minority were more likely to engage in maladaptive strategies including disengagement and substance use  as well as humor  an adaptive coping strategy  Park et al 
 Though the potential benefits of religious and or spiritual identification and engagement for well being are well documented  Paloutzian et al 
  the absence of religious and or spiritual belief is not necessarily associated with low levels of well being  or poor adjustment following traumatic events 
Rather  the coherency hypothesis suggests the ability to make sense of the world  in whatever way fits for a person  is associated with well being 
Among nonreligious and nonspiritual people in Canada  engagement in religiousness  spirituality  and related practices  e g  meditation  church attendance  ranged from not associated to negatively associated with mental health  such that higher R S among nonreligious and nonspiritual participants was related to lower well being  Speed et al 
 
Therefore  it is more accurate to suggest religious and spiritual engagement  e g  prayer  church attendance  is generally beneficial for the health of those with religious and spiritual beliefs and values  Speed et al 
  but not a necessary condition of health for all people 
Galen et al 
  for example  found evidence of a curvilinear relationship between  non religiousness and well being  such that those with high levels of religiousness spirituality as well as those with high levels of nonreligiousness nonspirituality reported higher well being as compared to those with medium or low levels of  non religiousness non spirituality 
However  scant literature has explored the implications of this curvilinear relationship for mental health and well being in response to specific traumatic events  e g  natural disasters  pandemics The authors  Abbott et al 
  examined the mediating role of coping strategies in the relationship between trauma intensity and posttraumatic symptoms and growth  as moderated by  non religiousness non spirituality following a natural disaster in a small  rural city in the Southeastern U S 
Consistent with previous research  lower levels of depressive symptoms and higher posttraumatic growth were associated with higher institutional religiousness and individual spirituality 
However  upon probing an interaction between trauma and non religion non spirituality  nonreligious and nonspiritual participants reported lower depressive symptoms and more posttraumatic growth when employing adaptive coping strategies  specifically problem focused coping  e g  active coping  instrumental support and planning  Abbott et al 
 
This preliminary study suggests differences  if any  in mental health across the  non religious non spiritual spectrum may be associated with coping mechanisms utilized and  perhaps  the congruence of coping style with  non belief system The current study sought to examine the relationships between pandemic related trauma symptoms   non religiousness and  non spirituality  coping strategies and psychological distress among U S  Americans 
In particular  we were interested in exploring differences  if any  between the coping mechanisms applied by individuals ranging from atheist to very religious and subsequent mental health outcomes  in response to the COVID  pandemic 
Specifically  we hypothesized that   the relationship between pandemic related trauma and psychological distress would operate indirectly through coping style and   the relationships between trauma  psychological distress and coping will be moderated by institutional religiousness and individual spirituality such that differences are observed in those at high and low levels of R S  as compared to moderate levels of R S  in the use of coping in response to the pandemic and the relationship between coping style and psychological distress  see Fig 
 One hundred fifty three participants   female    male    unreported sex assigned at birth  volunteered through social media snowball sampling 
The ethnic racial composition of the sample was   White    Black    Hispanic Latinx    Asian Asian American Pacific Islander and   Arab Persian Middle Eastern 
The median educational attainment was Associate s Degree level and the median reported household income was between   and  
Participants came from   different states with the largest contingents residing in Washington state   Texas   and California  
Twenty nine percent of the sample identified as disabled  specifically    identified a sensory impairment    a mobility impairment    a learning disability and   a mental health disorder 
Importantly    of respondents identified with a Christian faith  while a combined   identified as either atheist   agnostic   or religiously unaffiliated  
Data were collected in the period of time during which the majority of US jurisdictions had enacted  Stay At Home  or similar types of orders and recruitment was discontinued when restrictions were relaxed by many state and local governing bodies 
A post hoc sensitivity analysis revealed sufficient power for detecting medium sized effects  f      at standard significance and power criteria  α     power    Institutional Review Board approval was provided by Central Michigan University  – 
Data collection began in late April   and completed in mid June   and the study materials were pre registered on an open science forum at  https osf io tsdr 
Participants were recruited primarily via social media  e g  Reddit  and snowball sampling 
All U S based adults   years of age or older  were invited to engage in questions related to their experience of the pandemic  e g  stress  economic impact  isolation  and   surveys  Brief COPE  B COPE  Carver   Depression  Anxiety  Stress Scales –    DASS  Lovibond et al 
  NonReligious NonSpiritual Scale  NRNSS  Cragun et al 
  and a demographics questionnaire including items related to social physical distancing behaviors Coping strategies utilized by participants were assessed using the  item B COPE  Carver  
The scale is comprised of   subscales that may be organized into three composite subscales 
The acceptance  emotional support  humor  positive reframing and religion subscales  Emotion Focused  and active coping  instrumental support and planning subscales  Problem Focused  are categorized as Adaptive  whereas the behavioral disengagement  denial  self distraction  self blame  substance use and venting subscales  Dysfunctional  are Maladaptive  Carver et al 
 
Initial reliabilities were good  Emotion Focused     Problem Focused     Dysfunctional     and construct validity was evidenced  Cooper et al 
 
In the present study  internal consistency for each broad type of coping were as follows  Problem Focused Coping  α     Emotion Focused Coping  α     and Dysfunctional Coping  α    
The B COPE is the most frequently used measure of coping across academic journals 
Additionally  though the alpha for Emotion Focused Coping in this study is low  it is within the typical range reported for subscales in other studies using the B COPE  the two other subscales  alphas are similar to the median in extant literature  Kato  We additionally asked an open ended question prompting participants to report any coping behaviors in which they would normally engage but could not during the pandemic 
About half of participants   reported that they were unable to engage in some of their preferred coping behaviors and in all cases  the identified behaviors were emotion focused 
This likely contributed to the low internal consistency for Emotion Focused Coping 
Further  an exploratory reliability analysis with the sample split into high and low  non religiousness revealed that the emotion focused coping items had acceptable reliability for participants above the mean in institutional religiousness  α    Psychological distress was measured by the Depression  Anxiety  Stress Scales –    DASS  Lovibond et al 
  consisting of three subscales  Depression  Anxiety and Stress 
Participants were asked to report the degree to which statements  including  I found it hard to wind down  and  I felt I had nothing to look forward to  applied to them over the past week on a  point Likert scale ranging from  Did not apply to me at all  to  Applied to me very much  most of the time  Higher scores indicate higher rates of depressive  anxious and stress symptoms 
Initial reliabilities during development of the scale were α     for the Depression items  α     for the Anxiety items and α     for the Stress items 
Reliability for the entire scale in the current study was high  α    
 Non religiosity and  non spirituality were assessed via the NRNSS  Cragun et al 
  a  item measure consisting of two subscales  institutional religiousness and individual spirituality 
The NRNSS measures religiousness spirituality on a spectrum ranging from nonreligious nonspiritual to very religious spiritual 
Participants reported their level of agreement with items including  I would describe myself as a religious person  and  Spirituality is important to me  using a  point Likert scale 
High scores suggest low institutional religiousness  nonreligiosity  and low individual spirituality  nonspirituality  and  inversely  low scores indicate high religiousness and spirituality 
Initial testing demonstrated strong internal consistency  α    
In the present study  the α was   for the nonreligion subscale and   for the nonspirituality subscale The intensity of pandemic related trauma was assessed using   item   Overall  how traumatic is the COVID  pandemic for you 
Participants responded using a  point Likert scale ranging from  Not at all traumatic  to  Intolerably traumatic  Higher scores indicated participants perceived they were experiencing higher levels of personal trauma due to COVID 
This measure is consistent with the variable used when testing a similar model in our own previously published research  Abbott et al 
 The combination of trauma  institutional  non religiousness and the Trauma x  Non religiousness interaction predicted significant variance in two of the three types of coping  problem focused coping  R      F        p     and dysfunctional coping  R      F        p    
Significant unique predictors included  non religiousness  which was negatively associated with reduced problem focused and emotion focused coping and pandemic related trauma  which was positively associated with more dysfunctional coping 
The overall model was not significant for emotion focused coping  R      F        p    
See Table   for summaries of unique effects of predictors on mediators The combination of trauma   non religiousness  problem focused coping  emotion focused coping  dysfunctional coping  Trauma x  Non religiousness  Problem focused Coping x  Non religiousness  Emotion focused Coping x  Non religiousness and Dysfunctional Coping x  Non religiousness predicted significant variance in psychological distress  R      F        p    
Significant unique predictors included trauma  problem focused coping and dysfunctional coping 
Increased trauma and dysfunctional coping were each associated with increased psychological distress  while increased problem focused coping predicted lower distress 
See Table   for a summary of the effects of unique predictors on the outcome variable While the interaction between trauma and  non religiousness was nonsignificant  indicating it cannot be concluded that individuals were affected by trauma differently based on their level of institutional  non religiousness  the conditional direct effect of trauma on psychological distress was significant at low and moderate levels of institutional  non religiousness but not significant at high levels of  non religiousness 
However  the conditional indirect effect of trauma on psychological distress through the mechanism of dysfunctional coping was significant at high nonreligiousness and moderate levels of  non religiousness  but not at low levels of  non religiousness Trauma and dysfunctional coping were both significant predictors of psychological distress and the trauma effect was significant via the mechanism of dysfunctional coping at moderate and high levels of  non religiousness 
This indicates  perhaps  that both religious and nonreligious individuals experienced psychological distress in the aftermath of trauma but that nonreligious individuals experienced psychological distress due to utilization of dysfunctional coping strategies 
The question of whether the direct and indirect effects are different for those across the spectrum of institutional  non religiousness remains unclear with current statistical power  however 
See Table   for summaries of unique effects of predictors on depressive symptoms The combination of trauma   non spirituality and the Trauma x  Non spirituality interaction predicted significant variance in two of the three types of coping  Problem focused coping  R      F        p     and dysfunctional coping  R      F        p    
The overall model was not significant for emotion focused coping  R      F        p    
Significant unique predictors included higher levels of  non spirituality associated with reduced problem focused coping and higher levels of pandemic related trauma associated with higher levels of dysfunctional coping 
See Table   for summaries of unique effects of predictors on mediators The combination of trauma   non spirituality  problem focused coping  emotion focused coping  dysfunctional coping  Trauma x  Non spirituality  Problem focused Coping x  Non spirituality  Emotion focused Coping x  Non spirituality and Dysfunctional Coping x  Non spirituality predicted significant variance in psychological distress  R      F        p    
Significant unique predictors included trauma  problem focused coping  dysfunctional coping and the  Non spirituality x Dysfunctional Coping interaction 
Increased trauma and dysfunctional coping were both associated with higher psychological distress  whereas increased problem focused coping predicting lower depressive symptoms 
See Table   for summaries of unique effects of predictors on the outcome variable Probing the  Non spirituality x Dysfunctional Coping interaction showed that the indirect effect of trauma on psychological distress through the mechanism of dysfunctional coping was significant at moderate and high levels of  non spirituality but not at low levels of  non spirituality 
This is consistent with the nonsignificant trend found in the  non religiousness model reported above and lends credence to the assumption that the interaction in that model should reach significance with more statistical power The relationship between pandemic related trauma and psychological distress in the current examination is congruent with previous collective trauma research  Baral et al 
  Goldmann et al 
  including a similar examination of coping and  non religiousness following a natural disaster  Abbott et al 
  and emerging data related to COVID   Schecter et al 
 
Therefore  it appears depressive  anxious and stress symptoms are possible in response to the COVID  pandemic among people in the US across the  non religious non spiritual spectrum Evidence regarding the relationships between religiousness and health is mixed 
Some research has suggested a curvilinear relationship between  non religiousness and health  Galen   but assumptions of compromised health among nonreligious people persist  in part due to an abundance of scholarship demonstrating a positive relationship between religiousness and psychological health  Paloutzian et al 
 
More recent research found comparable health outcomes and levels of happiness among theists and nontheists  Speed et al 
  and emphasized the importance of a coherent sense of the world and congruence between  non religiousness non spirituality and behaviors for health outcomes  Speed et al 
 
Our results may speak to some nuances in this relationship and the contexts in which it operates 
First  our results are consistent with prior findings indicating that those with moderate levels of religiousness exhibit lower well being than their highly religious or nonreligious counterparts  Galen et al 
  and that this may be related to dysfunctional coping 
Second  the unique context of the COVID  pandemic  associated stay at home orders and the resulting physical distancing recommendations may have exacerbated social isolation among nonbelievers and prevented them from engaging in effective emotion focused coping strategies as evidenced by the low reliability of the emotion focused coping items for nonreligious individuals and the open ended responses Internal consistency for the emotion focused coping subscale was adequate among more religious participants 
Indeed  religious spiritual participants could still engage in independent faith based coping strategies including prayer  meditation and comfort in their belief system and places of religious worship were among the first locations allowed to reopen in many areas of the country 
Although nonreligious people benefit similarly from social connection with like minded people  Galen   organized groups of nonbelievers can be difficult to find  inaccessible to nonbelievers with marginalized cultural positionalities  Abbott et al 
  or primarily online where the benefits of engagement on mental health may be less pronounced  Brewster et al 
  even under normal circumstances 
All of this is consistent with the notion that social support and belonging are the driving mechanisms behind the well documented relationship between religious commitment and well being Further  although previous research suggested nonreligious nonspiritual people were more likely to use problem focused coping in response to collective trauma in the form of a natural disaster  Abbott et al 
  perhaps due to their tendency to engage in analytical thinking to evaluate circumstances  Franks et al 
  Baker et al 
  most people are likely able to draw upon knowledge of other natural disasters by which they or others have been impacted in determining a personal response 
The novel nature of the COVID  pandemic may have made it difficult for nonreligious people to engage in otherwise preferred and problem focused methods of coping like planning  taking action to improve the situation and soliciting advice from others 
Substance use  a dysfunctional coping strategy  is associated with COVID related stress  particularly among women  Rodriguez et al 
  and represents a possible explanation for the relationship between higher trauma intensity and higher use of dysfunctional coping in the current investigation given a little over two thirds of participants were women The current study was limited by having insufficient statistical power for detecting small effects 
The limited time frame for collecting data  during the time period during which US jurisdictions enacted the most restrictive measures to contain the novel coronavirus and a lack of funding for quickly recruiting large numbers of participants resulted in a study powered enough to detect medium sized effects and larger 
As only   participants out of the already modest sample agreed to be contacted for follow up  we were unable to conduct a pre registered follow up data collection phase meant to measure posttraumatic growth 
Future research examining differences in coping strategies in response to traumatic events among individuals across the  non religious non spiritual spectrum should seek larger samples  employ longitudinal methods and explore other relevant variables  e g  posttraumatic growth  given this and previous research  e g  Abbott et al 
  have demonstrated important differences between individuals high and low on such measures Like all COVID  research conducted with a nationwide sample  this study was also subject to uncontrolled variance due to the US  lack of a coordinated national response to the pandemic 
Restrictions varied greatly state by state and sometimes county by county 
Some states also lagged far behind others in terms of the timing and severity of the pandemic s effects on public health and the economy 
Future research should  if possible  control for these factors perhaps using geographically nested analyses or by concentrating on a specific geographic region An error in survey design led to the omission of a measure for participant age 
Age effects would be hard to find in this study due to the relatively small sample size and the use of a sampling method  e g  Reddit  that would likely result in a very young sample 
A majority of young adults  however  are living with their parents rather than cohabitating with a friend  spouse  or significant other during the COVID  pandemic  Fry et al 
  which could  along with the increased propensity for the young to be non religious  Pew Research Center   make it more difficult for them to engage in emotion focused coping during a socially isolating event like a pandemic 
Future research should also examine age related differences in coping styles and outcomes during the coronavirus era The present examination suggests a complex relationship between self perceived COVID related trauma intensity  coping strategies  psychological distress and  non religiousness non spirituality  such that people across the  non religious non spiritual spectrum experience distress related to the COVID  pandemic 
However  the use and availability of typical adaptive and maladaptive coping mechanisms appears to vary by strength of  non religious non spiritual orientation in response to collective trauma 
Future  large scale studies are needed to continue exploring the relationship between exposure to collective traumatic events  psychological health and coping among people of diverse  non religious and  non spiritual identities in the interest of understanding what adaptive coping strategies are most useful  particularly for nontheists given their underrepresentation in extant trauma and coping literature A case of macrophage activation syndrome in a patient with anti synthetase syndromeAnti synthetase syndrome  ASS  is an autoimmune disease characterized by autoantibodies against an aminoacyl transfer RNA  tRNA  synthetase with clinical features that may include interstitial lung disease  ILD  non erosive arthritis  myositis  Raynaud s phenomenon  unexplained fever and or mechanic s hands   
Macrophage activation syndrome  MAS  can be a fatal complication of rheumatic disorders 
It has rarely been reported in patients with ASS 
Here  we describe this association in an adult patient We present a case of  year old Nepalese female with an overlap of ASS and anti cyclic citrullinated peptide  CCP  antibody positive rheumatoid arthritis  RA  who developed MAS which was successfully treated with anakinra 
She was diagnosed with ASS based on the presence of arthritis  ILD  anti Jo  and antiRo  autoantibodies 
She was maintained on  monthly Rituximab cycles  one  gm infusion repeated   days after the first for each cycle  completed two cycles  last given   months prior to her presentation 
In view of the coronavirus disease    COVID  pandemic the third cycle was withheld and Azathioprine was commenced which she took for   weeks 
Two weeks prior to her admission Azathioprine was switched to an up titrating dose of Mycophenolate due to nonspecific symptoms of headache and dizziness attributed to possible medication intolerance 
She was admitted with fever  abdominal pain and headaches 
Clinical examination revealed pyrexia  C  hypotension   mmHg  tachycardia  HR   bpm  and palmar maculopapular rash 
Laboratory investigations showed pancytopenia  Hb    –  g L  WCC    –     L  Platelets    –     L  Neutrophils    –     L  lymphocytes    –      L  Ferritin of      –  ug L  Triglycerides     mmol L  LDH    –  IU L  Fibrinogen   g l normal  ALT     IU L  CRP    –  mg L  and ESR   mm hr A septic screen for common bacterial and viral pathogens including parvovirus  Epstein Barr virus  Cytomegalovirus  human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis was negative 
Multiple covid  swabs were negative 
Computed tomography of chest  abdomen and pelvis showed no evidence of hepatosplenomegaly or an underlying malignancy 
Lack of improvement with broad spectrum antimicrobials  evolving pancytopenia  elevated ferritin and persistent fever with patient s background history of autoimmune disease raised concerns about MAS

Anakinra   mg once daily subcutaneously was added after Multidisciplinary team discussion to reduce steroid toxicity and facilitate a rapid steroid taper  whilst providing optimal disease control 
Immediate clinical improvement was noted with normalization of fevers and gradual normalization of laboratory abnormalities including ferritin  cell counts  Fig   and inflammatory markers 
We believe an underlying rheumatic immune disorder was the likely predisposing factor for the development of MAS in our patient  as she was not maintained on biologic immunomodulatory therapy due to paused Rituximab in view of COVID  pandemic and possible intolerance to various agents Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis  HLH  is characterized by an unregulated inflammatory response with cytokine storm leading to multisystem organ failure and can be fatal if not recognized and treated promptly 
HLH can be familial  primary  or acquired  secondary to infection  malignancy or active autoinflammation 
Secondary HLH  sHLH  in association with rheumatologic autoimmune diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus  adult onset Still disease  and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis is known as MAS   
However  it is rarely seen in patients with ASS and has been described only in case reports where most patients reportedly suffered from dermatomyositis 
Anti  Jo  anti  Mi  and anti MDA  autoantibodies have been found in cases of idiopathic inflammatory myositis complicated by MAS   
Early diagnosis is often challenging due to clinical manifestations mimicking sepsis  active autoimmune diseases and lack of widely accepted diagnostic criteria 
Various tools have been developed which use clinical symptoms and laboratory abnormalities to risk stratify patients but have limitations 
The H score by Fardet et al 
  has been validated for the diagnosis of reactive HLH and subsequently showed good diagnostic accuracy in an observational study by Knaak et al 
  
However  clinical judgement and awareness of the condition remains paramount in diagnosis 
Timely diagnosis and treatment to reduce systemic inflammation is imperative to reduce high mortality 
High dose glucocorticoid monotherapy is usually the first line treatment with subsequent addition of immunomodulatory agents in refractory cases   
Over recent years  various biologics and immunotherapies have been used successfully for MAS treatment 
This also includes Anakinra  a recombinant interleukin   IL  receptor antagonist used in various autoinflammatory diseases 
Although limited  there are now case reports and series showing favourable response to anakinra  both subcutaneously and intravenously in sHLH subtypes   
Its use is also appealing due to relatively short half life that permits its discontinuation if an adverse effect occurs or concern for worsening infection arises Our case was challenging as patient initially manifested joint symptoms with positive immunology for RA and later developed ILD with positive ASS immune profile in the absence of clinical myositis  typical skin rash and normal CK levels 
Aminoacyl tRNA positivity has been described in patients who fulfilled RA diagnostic criteria in the literature and hence ASS is an important clinical condition in the differential diagnosis of early RA 
It has been reported that development of myositis can take years after onset of arthritis and ILD  which are also not rarely seen before myositis and in some myositis never occurs   
The most common arthritis pattern seen in ASS is small joint symmetrical polyarthritis quite similar what seen in RA 
AntiCCP and rheumatoid factor positivity can be observed in ASS and lead to false RA diagnosis   
On the other hand  established knowledge that ASS is seen in cases with classical RA is quite limited 
Current literature regarding the use of anakinra in cases of adult MAS is limited  further information regarding its effectiveness and potential clinical benefits and risks is needed

An event is serious  based on the ICH definition  when the patient outcome is  death  life threatening  hospitalisation  disability  congenital anomaly  other medically important eventA  year old woman exhibited lack of efficacy during off label treatment with dexamethasone  unspecified antibacterials and unspecified corticosteroids for COVID The woman  who was diagnosed with common variable immunodeficiency in   had received treatment with immune globulin 
Subsequently  she was hospitalised on   August   due to cough  fever  dyspnoea and   blood oxygen saturation 
Further detailed analysis led to the diagnosis of severe COVID  infection  and she was treated with low flow supplemental oxygen along with unspecified off label antibacterial  antibiotics and off label unspecified corticosteroid  and was kept on mechanical ventilation 
After further worsening  she was initiated on an off label treatment with unspecified wide spectrum antibacterial and dexamethasone  dosages and routes not stated 
However  her dyspnoea and fever were persistent despite the intense clinical and pharmacological treatment  lack of efficacy 
On   August   her blood oxygen saturation was   on high flux supplemental oxygen 
A considerable worsening of the lung damage was noted on a CT scan  and she was treated with off label convalescent anti sars cov plasma  COVID  convalescent donor plasma infusion as   mL   SARS Cov  specific neutralising antibody  nAb  and  mL   nAb 
Subsequently  an improvement was noted 
Therefore  the supplemental oxygen was reduced to low flow  and she was administered second dose of convalescent anti sars cov plasma infusion  mL    nAb 
She received final dose of convalescent anti sars cov plasma infusion  mL    nAb on   August  
She was removed from supplemental oxygen 
She remained asymptomatic thereafter
